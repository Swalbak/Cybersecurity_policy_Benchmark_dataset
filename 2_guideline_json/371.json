Expectations  grow with the broadband capabilities of 5G, accessible to everyone and everywhere at a better  quality and reliability. From a conceptual perspective, 5G technology promises to deliver low  latency, high speed and more reliable connections to new generations of autonomous systems  and edge-type devices, covering both massive and critical machine-type communications.  Furthermore, 5G technology is driven by use cases with a wide range of requirements. One of  the first commercial offers expected, is the Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) for dense urban  areas. Other use cases, such as the ones demanding dedicated coverage, vertical solutions  (i.e. connected vehicles), manufacturing, Industry 4.0, IIoT, energy, and healthcare, will come  at a later stage. Experts agree that verticals will be the main driving force in future  deployments of 5G Networks. These will play an essential role in investment strategies of  Mobile Network Operators MNOs.1  As networks and applications evolve further, there will be even more opportunities to enhance  existing use cases in addition to more verticals becoming part of the 5G infrastructure. As an  example, 5G will be highly beneficial for industrial use cases demanding higher data rates and  lower latency such as augmented reality (AR) and AI-based applications. Significant bandwidth  capabilities will assure the consistency of high-resolution images and video streaming, similarly  to sensor-rich environments with high connection density.  In the realm of this transition, the industry forecasted 1.5 billion users subscribed to a 5G  network and coverage to reach over 40 percent of the world's population by 2024.2 According to  the European 5G Observatory, citizens should have 5G access by 2020.3 In terms of  geographical coverage, 5G is expected to be deployed first in dense urban areas and later, in  less populated sub-urban and rural areas.  Mobile communication systems have been prone to security vulnerabilities from their very  inception. In the first generation (1G) of mobile networks, mobile phones and wireless channels  became a target for illegal cloning and masquerading. In the second generation (2G), message  spamming became common, not only for pervasive attacks but also for injecting false  information or broadcasting unwanted marketing information. In the third generation (3G), IP-  based communication enabled the migration of Internet security vulnerabilities and threats into  the wireless domain. With a growing demand for IP based communications, the fourth  generation (4G) enabled the proliferation of smart devices, multimedia traffic, and new services  into the mobile domain. This development led to a more complex and dynamic threat  landscape4,5.  With the advent of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks, security threat vectors will  expand, in particular with the exposure of new connected industries (Industry4.0) and critical  services (connected vehicular, smart cities etc.). The 3G revolution, introducing internet  1 https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/#program, accessed September 2019.  2 https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/mobility-report/documents/2019/ericsson-mobility-report-world-economic-forum.pdf,  accessed September 2019.  3 http://5gobservatory.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/80082-5G-Observatory-Quarterly-report-2-V2.pdf, accessed  September 2019.  4 http://www.webtorials.com/main/resource/papers/lucent/paper94/MobileNetworkThreats.pdf, accessed September 2019.  5 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7547270, accessed Spetember 2019.

The integration with and exposure to the data network, is even more  prevalent across the 5G network.  The growing concerns over availability and protection of user data and privacy will exacerbate  with the security challenges introduced 5G. Hence, the most critical challenges relate to the  resilience of the network and the protection of content and metadata of 5G communications.  This report draws an initial threat landscape and presents an overview of the challenges in the  security of 5G networks. Its added value lays with the creation of a comprehensive 5G  architecture, the identification of important assets (asset diagram), the assessment of threats  affecting 5G (threat taxonomy), the identification of asset exposure (threats – assets mapping)  and an initial assessment of threat agent motives.  The content of this Threat Landscape is fully aligned with the EU-Wide Coordinated Risk  Assessment of 5G networks security.6 The EU-wide Coordinated Risk Assessment, published  on the 9th of October 2019 by the European Commission, which built on the methodological  approach developed for the threat landscape, presents in Section 2(D) ten high-level risk  scenarios based on the information provided by Member States within National Risk  Assessments.  The ENISA 5G Threat Landscape leverages from and complements this information by  providing a more detailed technical view on the 5G architecture, sensitive assets, cyberthreats  affecting the assets and threat agents. The information produced for this Threat Landscape is  based on publicly available information published by 5G standardisation groups and bodies (i.e.  ETSI, 3GPP, 5GPPP) and 5G stakeholders such as operators, vendors, national and  international organisations. An expert group with experts from mobile operators, vendors,  research and European Commission has contributed to ENISA’s work with information on  existing 5G material, current developments in the market and research and quality assurance of  the current document. Moreover, the members of the NIS CG, European Commission and  ENISA have reviewed the current document.  In particular, the content of this Threat Landscape includes:   A detailed architecture, outlining the most important/critical 5G infrastructure  components, through nine detailed ‘Zoom-ins’ of 5G architectural elements mentioned  in section 2 (B) of the Coordinated Risk Assessment. Examples of these elements  include the core network functions (NFV), management and network orchestration  (MANO), radio access network (RAN), and others;   A detailed threat assessment on 5G infrastructure components considering the  identified sensitive assets. The assessed threats refine/extend the ones presented in  section 2 (A) of the Coordinated Risk Assessment. A mapping provided in the annexes  show the relationships of the both reports (see Annex C, a mapping between ten risk  scenarios and assessed threats);   An initial assessment of the motives and capabilities of threat agents concerning 5G  assets, extending the information provided in section 2 (A) of the Coordinated Risk  Assessment;  6 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security, accessed  October 2019.

INTRODUCTION  The ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks report delivers some of the most relevant  aspects related to the type, origin and objectives of cybersecurity threats targeting this new  generation of mobile networks. To better understand these threats, it is essential to know what  is at stake and what can be compromised. This report represents a first attempt to identify the  most critical components (assets) in a 5G Network, which may become a target to various  cybersecurity threats. The task of assessing threats has posed multiple challenges: the overall  5G Infrastructure is a very complex ecosystem in which legacy and contemporary mainstream  technologies converge. The production of a comprehensive 5G architecture covering all  essential elements/functions constitutes another challenging task. The creation of a coherent  and comprehensive architecture employing elements from existing generic 5G architectures  requires an alignment with existing and ongoing work produced by standardisation bodies and  other relevant entities (e.g. 3GPP, 5GPPP, ITU, ETSI and GSMA). The comprehensive 5G  architecture presented in this report is further detailed in various ‘Zoom-ins’, providing more  information on the most sensitive 5G components.  Another challenge is to identify the threat exposure to specific 5G assets, which are still in an  early specification stage within the technology industry, Service Providers and Mobile Network  Operators (MNO). Moreover, given that 5G Networks are currently in a pilot phase, the lack of  known incidents and information about weaknesses makes the analysis of threat exposure even  more challenging. This fact forced us to identify possible 5G cyberthreats by assessing the  threat exposure on various subsystems based on previous experience. By analysing existing  material - including EU-Wide Coordinated Risk Assessment of 5G networks security -we also  collected theoretical cyberthreats identified by analogy to existing mobile networks. For similar  reasons, it has been challenging to find relevant information on threat agents targeting 5G  components. Hence, the discussion on threat agents is based on the assumption that various  motives may justify an attack. Finally, some bibliographical references used as a baseline for  this report are still considered as ‘work in progress’ by the authors (standardisation bodies,  vendors, operators, regulators and policymakers). This makes the information collection process  even more difficult as it brings ‘white spots’ for some content that is potentially relevant for the  analysis of threats (e.g. vulnerabilities, mitigation controls, implementation guidelines, etc.).  For all the reasons mentioned above, it is worth noticing that this first attempt to analyse 5G  threats and assets will need to be extended. It will require regular updates to increase the level  of detail, completeness and inclusion of new developments. ENISA may further elaborate this  assessment to include more details both at the levels of the 5G infrastructure and the relevant  cyberthreats, when requested and on-demand from stakeholders (e.g. European Commission  and Member States – NIS Cooperation Group).  For the time being, this report aims at supporting various stakeholders understanding the  relevant cyberthreats and the asset exposure within the 5G ecosystem. When requested,  ENISA is in a position to support stakeholders ‘drilling down’ the analysis further, by including  granular details from the components in focus and examine the relevance of the assessed  cyberthreats.  To better  understand the  cyberthreats  affecting 5G  Networks, it is  essential to know  the most critical  assets that may  be targeted by  malicious actors  and the threat  exposure of  these assets.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  10  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  The present report was prepared following the European Commission Recommendation (EU)  2019/534 of 26 March 2019 Cybersecurity on 5G networks,7 requesting the Member States to  carry out a risk assessment of the 5G network infrastructure. In this recommendation, the  European Commission requested ENISA to provide support to the Member States in this  exercise by preparing a threat landscape reviewing the most critical aspects of the technology.  Moreover, in the new ENISA regulation, the need to analyse current and emerging risks is  expressed. In line with this role, ENISA regulation stipulates that: “the Agency should, in  cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collect  relevant information.” 8 More specifically, it is stated that it should “enable effective responses to  current and emerging network and information security risks and threats.” 9  Therefore, the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape aims at contributing to the EU Cybersecurity  Strategy and more specifically, to ongoing policy initiatives related with the security of networks  and information systems; it streamlines and consolidates available information on cyberthreats  and their evolution.  1.2 SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY  The overarching nature of 5G, its complexity, the lack of information on existing deployments,  the width and depth of existing specifications and the large number of potential stakeholders  involved, makes the assessment of cyberthreats a difficult task. Being aware of this challenge,  the European Commission issued a recommendation urging EU Member States to assess the  risks and requesting ENISA to outline the corresponding cyberthreats.10 This report is the main  deliverable of this activity. This assessment was not the first attempt for ENISA to describe the  landscape. In 2016, ENISA published a Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for  Software Defined Networks/5G.11  The objectives, working modalities, method and scope set for this report are as follows:   The main objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview of the 5G  architecture while describing the decomposition of its sensitive assets, structured in  accordance with the level of exposure to various cyberthreats. This 5G architecture  provides a better overview of the supporting infrastructure and its main components  and facilitates the identification of sensitive assets.   To reduce the amount of material presented in this report, the focus was put on the  RAN and CORE components, leaving out any interconnected services, APIs,  application components and various sectors/verticals (e.g. Transportation, eHealth,  Industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT), Smart Environments, etc.).   To keep the related material to a manageable size, not every detail from 5G  specifications were included in this report. Instead, we considered the various relevant  network functions, virtualisation functions, radio access network, network management  functions and data household of the relevant components.

These may be included at a later stage in an on-demand basis.   Technical vulnerabilities were intentionally left out of scope to reduce complexity and to  optimise available resources. We plan to assess and analyse technical vulnerabilities  in detail in future versions of this report.   This report does not prescribe any mitigation measures/security controls to reduce the  5G Network exposure. This is ongoing work of various committees. Another reason is  the high complexity of 5G infrastructures and the low number of implementations: while  some mitigation measures are mentioned in specifications, there are still no good  practices in the protection of 5G Infrastructures. A significant amount of work will be  required - including the extrapolation of good practices of existing mobile  communication - to define security controls needed to protect 5G infrastructures. This  work may be performed in future iterations of the 5G threat analysis by taking into  account the results of ongoing initiatives (research projects, standardisation work, etc.).   The scope of this report is in line with previous work developed by ENISA, in particular,  the Threat Landscape for Software-Defined Networks/5G.12   This threat landscape complements the information provided in the EU Consolidated  Risk Assessment by providing an in-depth analysis of assets and threats, without  exposing any confidential information. This principle has been followed during the  decomposition of 5G assets and the preparation of the cyberthreat taxonomy. This  approach will help future on-demand risk assessments using the present threat  landscape (e.g. further focusing the scope in various asset categories, threat types,  etc.).   The report does not contain any content related to current 5G deployment strategies of  vendors and MNOs. Instead, it reflects the state-of-play in 5G  specification/development work (e.g. 5G-PPP), rather than current 5G  deployments/migration paths. It is planned to review this scope in future versions of the  threat landscape, pursuing the engagement of stakeholders involved in 5G  implementations.   The development of this report followed a ‘best-effort’ approach. The collected  information is not exhaustive but representative of the matters covered.   To collect relevant technical knowledge, ENISA has set up an expert group consisting  of individuals that are involved in 5G activities from vendors, operators,  research/academia and European Commission. The selection has been made based  on professional merits of the selected individuals (i.e. ad personam), while at the same  time trying to cover the skills from the most representative stakeholder types that are  currently engaged in 5G activities.   The content of this report was restricted to components/matters found in relevant open-  source material covering the entire specification, security requirements and research  results related to 5G network functions (NFs).  The method adopted for this study is in line with the methodology developed by ENISA for the  preparation of its annual Cyberthreat Landscape. According to this methodology, the process  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape, accessed September 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  12  requires an initial identification of critical assets within the architecture before performing a  threat assessment, which evaluates the different levels of asset exposure.  The elements of cyberthreats and the relationship to risks are graphically depicted inError!  Reference source not found.. The report describes the different relationships between assets,  threats and threat agents. In future versions of this report, we will cover vulnerabilities and  countermeasures (mitigation measures/security controls).  Figure 1: Methodology adopted based on ISO 27005  Threats play a central role in a risk assessment, especially when considering the different  components of risks. The ISO 27005, a widely adopted risk management standard, defines that  risks emerge when: “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the  organisation”.13  Following this methodology, we have identified assets, threats and threat agents. These  constitute the core of the 5G Threat Landscape presented in this report. Furthermore, the  identification and analysis of assets and cyberthreats are based on the study of specifications,  white papers and literature, without attempting any interpretation/evaluation of the assumptions  stated in these reports.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The objective of this report is to support stakeholders carrying out more detailed threat analyses  and risk assessments focussed on particular elements of the 5G infrastructure. Given the  current maturity of both 5G specifications and deployments, it is very likely that this need exists  across all types of involved stakeholders. Publicly available threat and risk analyses  demonstrate the current level of existing 5G assessments that are at rather high and/or abstract  level. To this extent, the information provided in this report may help stakeholders to understand  the details of 5G infrastructures and the corresponding threat exposure. Moreover, it outlines  the gaps supporting the identification of ‘known unknowns’. We believe that this could be a  valuable contribution towards the identification areas of future work.  13 https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html, accessed September 2019.  The 5G threat  landscape may  be useful to carry  out detailed  threat analyses  and risk  assessments for  telecom  operators and  service providers  according to their  particular needs  and mandate.

Both the asset inventory and threat taxonomy can be used  as-is or further developed by telco operators or other stakeholders through their own threat  analysis and risk assessments. The assessment of threats and vulnerabilities may also enrich a  more in-depth analysis of certain components, as far as they are relevant to the assets  deployed by the MNOs.  Moreover, many other non-technical stakeholders (e.g. policy-makers, regulators, law  enforcement, among others) may find this report useful to understand the current state of  threats and respective mitigation practices and measures. For example, the threat landscape  identified in this report may support policy actions in the areas of 5G networks, SDN, NFV,  cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and other sectors/verticals that plan to use the  5G Network.  Finally, research projects may find the information this report useful in a twofold manner: to be  used for threat/risk assessments of newly developed 5G components or to be used as a guide  to conduct gap analysis, driving thus new research projects.  1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  This report presents the results of the assessment conducted during the research work using  the following structure:   Chapter 2 presents the stakeholders having a role in deployment, operation and  supervision of the 5G infrastructure. They constitute an essential part of the 5G  ecosystem.

Among other things, these entities  will be responsible for assuring the security of the network at different levels and in separate  layers. According to the 5G-PPP White Paper on the architecture,14 the list of stakeholder roles  in the 5G ecosystem is the following:   Service customers (SC);   Service providers (SP);   Mobile Network Operators (MNO) also known as Network Operators (NOP);   Virtualisation Infrastructure Service Providers (VISP);   Data Centre Providers (DCSP).  Through the elaborations of this report, some additional stakeholders have been identified.  Their role is being characterized by the ownership/responsibility relationships to the 5G assets  described in this document. In addition, they have been assessed from input received from  involved experts. Although their role is not fully defined yet, it is believed that they are/will be  concerned with various issues related to the security of the 5G ecosystem. In the following list,  we present a short indicative note for each entity and its role:   Internet Exchange Points (IXPs): Being an important part of current Internet  infrastructure, IXPs (data network) providers play an important role in 5G, as they  support the end-to-end throughput of the data traffic.15   National Regulators (NRAs): Regulators will be asked to regulate various areas of  the 5G infrastructure (frequencies, identifiers, traffic laws, etc.).16   Information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs): ISACs will have to collect and  share 5G related intelligence. This can be achieved either by means of existing ISACs  and/or specific 5G ISACs.   National cybersecurity coordinators/agencies/centres (NCSCs): Existing  cybersecurity centres need to engage in 5G infrastructure matters in order to evaluate  and scrutinize major risks at national level, emanating from 5G infrastructure  deployments.17   National 5G Test Centres (NTCs): The creation of national 5G test centres has been  taken forward in some Member States in order to assess the quality and security of 5G  solutions.18 It is expected that this trend will lead to the creation of such facilities in  multiple EU Member States.   National Certification Authorities (NCAs): Given the fact that certification is a major  security control to be implemented for 5G components, it is expected that various  14 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_v3.0_PublicConsultation.pdf,  accessed September 2019.  15 http://www.leedsgrowthstrategy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WHY-5G-IN-LEEDS.pdf, accessed September 2019.  16 http://www.emergonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Introduction_to_5G_Amman.pdf, accessed September 2019.  17 https://www.ft.com/content/29eb5d28-e10d-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad, accessed September 2019.  18 https://dcnnmagazine.com/networking/telecoms-networking/manyooth-university-opens-radiospace-5g-test-centre/,  assessed September 2019.  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_v3.0_PublicConsultation.pdf http://www.leedsgrowthstrategy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WHY-5G-IN-LEEDS.pdf http://www.emergonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Introduction_to_5G_Amman.pdf https://www.ft.com/content/29eb5d28-e10d-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad https://dcnnmagazine.com/networking/telecoms-networking/manyooth-university-opens-radiospace-5g-test-centre/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  15  players will be active in definition and implementation of national 5G certification and  accreditation schemes.   Competent EU institutions and European Commission Services: These entities  will play a significant role in the coordination of national activities, standardisation work,  research projects and policy initiatives.  In different roles, the entities mentioned above should have different levels of concern regarding  5G assets, among other things carrying responsibility for the risk mitigation affecting those  assets. Stakeholders must develop strategies that, independently or co-responsibly, allow  reduction of exposure to cyberthreats.  Annex D shows the relationships between Stakeholders and 5G asset groups, helping the  reader to understand their potential involvement in the (risk/threat) management of the assets.

This architecture resulted from the analysis of various publicly available reports  published by standardisation, research and scientific bodies (e.g. 14, 19,24,25,26,27,28). This task  aimed at establishing a common and coherent understanding over the components of the 5G  architecture. Despite a large number of documents referring to various aspects of the 5G  architecture (e.g. individual network functions, interfaces, security functions, various 5G  domains, etc.), only a few provide a compressive overview. For the present work, the  visualisation of the different components in a modular and general manner was required. Once  the comprehensive technical 5G architecture has been defined, and after reviewing known  weaknesses of components, it was possible to list the sensitive assets and describe the most  relevant threats.  For this reason, the approach taken for this report was to develop a generic 5G architecture and  provide the details of individual key components by means of ‘Zoom-ins’, allowing further  detailing of their functionality and purpose. By doing so, besides the generic 5G architecture  depicted, we deliver a number of detailed views of particular components, namely: Core  Network, Management and Network Orchestrator (MANO), Radio Access Network (RAN),  Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Software Defined Network (SDN), Multi-access Edge  Computing (MEC), User Equipment (UE), Security Architecture (SA) and 5G Physical  Infrastructure components.  To deal with complexity, both at the level of the generic 5G architecture and individual ‘Zoom-  ins’, the details of the various interfaces and protocols have not been considered. A short  description of the purpose and functionality is provided in a separate table for each individual  component. A generic 5G architecture and the corresponding ‘Zoom-ins’ will help the  identification of sensitive assets presented in chapter 4.2.  3.1 5G USE CASES  The description of the network design and architecture is started by explaining the different Use  Cases defined for 5G Networks. 3GPP defined these Use Cases as part of its New Services  and Markets Technology Enabler (SMARTER) project.19 The objective behind SMARTER was  to develop high-level use cases and identify which features and functionalities are required to  enable them. The process started in 2015 and resulted in over 70 use cases, initially grouped  into five categories, which have been reduced to three. The three sets of Use Cases are as  follows.   Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB).20 Defined as an extension to existing 4G  broadband services, eMBB will be the first commercial 5G service enabling faster and more  reliable downloads. The thresholds defined in the ITU requirements for eMBB sets at a  minimum of 20Gbps for downlink and 10Gbps for uplink. Furthermore, the minimum  requirement for eMBB mobility interruption time is 0ms.  19 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01_10-Nov_Session-3_Dino-Flore.pdf, accessed September 2019.  20 https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-enhanced-mobile-broadband-embb/, accessed September 2019.  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01_10-Nov_Session-3_Dino-Flore.pdf https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-enhanced-mobile-broadband-embb/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  17   Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). The promise to delivery ultra-reliable  and low-latency communication for 5G wireless networks is considered of capital  importance. URLLC is designed to support businesses on mission critical communication  scenarios, such as emergency situations, autonomous systems operations, among  others.21 Examples include public safety services, operations of mining, autonomous  vehicles, oil and gas pipelines, robots, medical and entertainment. Achieving URLLC  represents one of the major challenges facing 5G networks.   Machine Type Communications (MTC).22 This Use Case is expected to play an essential  role in the future of 5G systems. In the seventh framework programme (FP7) project  METIS, 23 MTC has been further classified as ‘massive machine‐type communication’  (mMTC) and ‘ultra‐reliable machine‐type communication’ (uMTC). While mMTC is about  wireless connectivity to tens of billions of machine‐type terminals, uMTC is about  availability, low latency, and high reliability. The main challenges in mMTC is to deliver  scalable and efficient connectivity for a massive number of devices sending very short  packets, which is not done adequately in cellular systems designed for human‐type  communications. Furthermore, mMTC solutions need to enable wide area coverage and  deep indoor penetration while having low cost and being energy efficient. For MTC, ITU  defined a minimum requirement for connection density of 1,000,000 devices per km2.  Multiple deployment scenarios for eMBB, mMTC and URLLC can be envisioned in future  implementations of this technology. A study developed by ETSI identified some of these future  scenarios presented in Table 1.24  Table 1 - 5G deployment scenarios  Deployment Scenarios  Indoor hotspot  The indoor hotspot deployment scenario focuses on small coverage per site/TRxP (transmission and  reception point) and high user throughput or user density in buildings. The key characteristics of this  deployment scenario are high capacity, high user density and consistent user experience indoor.

The key  characteristics of this deployment scenario are high traffic loads, outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor  coverage. This scenario will be interference-limited, using macro TRxPs with or without micro TRxPs. A  continuous cellular layout and the associated interference shall be assumed.  Rural  The rural deployment scenario focuses on larger and continuous coverage. The key characteristics of  this scenario are continuous wide area coverage supporting high-speed vehicles. This scenario will be  noise-limited and/or interference limited, using macro TRxPs.

The key  characteristics of this scenario are continuous and ubiquitous coverage in urban areas. This scenario will  be interference-limited, using macro TRxPs (i.e. radio access points above rooftop level).  High speed  The high-speed deployment scenario focuses on continuous coverage along track in high speed trains.  The key characteristics of this scenario are consistent passenger user experience and critical train  communication reliability with very high mobility. In this deployment scenario, dedicated linear  deployment along railway line and the deployments including SFN scenarios captured in Section 6.2 of  3GPP TR 36.878 are considered, and passenger UEs are located in train carriages.25 For the passenger  UEs, if the antenna of relay node for eNB-to-Relay is located at top of one carriage of the train, the  antenna of relay node for Relay-to-UE could be distributed to all carriages.  Extreme long distance coverage in low density areas  The extreme Long Range deployment scenario is defined to allow for the Provision of services for very  large areas with low density of users whether they are humans and machines (e.g. Low ARPU regions,  wilderness, areas where only highways are located, etc). The key characteristics of this scenario are  Macro cells with very large area coverage supporting basic data speeds and voice services, with low to  moderate user throughput and low user density.  Urban coverage for massive connection  The urban coverage for massive connection scenario focuses on large cells and continuous coverage to  provide mMTC. The key characteristics of this scenario are continuous and ubiquitous coverage in urban  areas, with very high connection density of mMTC devices.  The main drivers identified for these Use Cases - reflected in the requirements and  specifications of 5G Networks - are bandwidth, latency, availability, reliability, efficiency and  coverage. In the next sections, we will present the critical elements of the network architecture  that will enable these Use Cases.  3.2 GENERIC 5G ARCHITECTURE  The generic 5G architecture is presented through its main components depicted as labelled  boxes. These boxes have been arranged based on layers, depicting their functional role in the  5G architecture (i.e. virtualisation layer and physical infrastructure layer). This architecture aims  at providing an overview of the main groups of foreseen 5G functionality and is a consolidation  of components/functions found in the analysed material (e.g.14,19,24,25,26,27,28).  Specifically in 5G, the architecture was designed in a way that connectivity and services of data  can be supported, enabling techniques such as Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Network  Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). This service-based architecture meets  multiple functional and performance requirements built upon new use cases in a cost efficient  way.  The generic 5G architecture presents an overview of the various components that are further  detailed and depicted through specific ‘Zoom-ins’ in forthcoming sections. It is worth mentioning  that for the OSS/BSS component, no ‘Zoom-in’ was developed. However, it has been included  in the generic 5G architecture for consistency reasons.  The 5G generic or high-level technical architecture is depicted in the following figure:  25 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2885, accessed  September 2019.  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2885  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  19  Figure 2: 5G High-level technical architecture  3.3 CORE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most important innovations in the 5G architecture is the complete virtualisation of the  Core network. As an example, the ‘softwarisation’ of network functions will enable easier  portability and higher flexibility of networking systems and services (Control-User Plain  Separation, CUPS). The Software Defined Network (SDN) brings simplified management  together with innovation through abstraction. Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) provides the  enabling technology for placing various network functions in different network components on  the basis of performance needs/requirements; and eliminates the need for function- or service-  specific hardware. SDN and NFV, complementing each other, improve the network elasticity,  simplify network control and management, break the barrier of vendor-specific or proprietary  solutions, and are thus considered as highly important for future networks. These novel network  technologies and concepts - heavily relying on ‘softwarisation’ and virtualisation of network  functions will introduce new and complex threats.  The Core network is the central part of the 5G infrastructure and enables new functions related  to multi-access technologies. Its main purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks  (wireless, fixed, converged).26  The Core network has been defined by 3GPP27 and its structure is as follows:  26 https://www.nokia.com/networks/portfolio/5g-core/#defining-a-new-5g-core, accessed September 2019.  27 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/123500_123599/123501/15.02.00_60/ts_123501v150200p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  https://www.nokia.com/networks/portfolio/5g-core/#defining-a-new-5g-core https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/123500_123599/123501/15.02.00_60/ts_123501v150200p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  20  Figure 3: Core network architecture zoom-in  A description of the elements of the 5G Core network is as follows:  Element Short description  Access and Mobility  Management function  (AMF)  (As defined in 3GPP TS23.501 Section 6.2.1)28  AMF may include the following functionalities:   Termination of RAN CP interface;   Termination of NAS, NAS ciphering and integrity  protection;   Registration management;   Connection management;   Reachability management;   Mobility Management;   Lawful interception;   Provide transport for SM messages between UE and  SMF;   Transparent proxy for routing SM messages;  28 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3144, accessed  September 2019.  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3144  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  21   Access Authentication;   Access Authorization;   Provide transport for SMS messages between UE and  SMSF;   Security Anchor Functionality;   Location Services management for regulatory services;   Provide transport for Location Services messages  between UE and LMF as well as between RAN and LMF  and   EPS Bearer ID allocation for interworking with EPS; UE  mobility event notification.

A  clear benefit of 5G network slicing for operators will be the ability to deploy only the functions  necessary to support specific customers and particular market segments.31  Communication between autonomous cars, for instance, requires minimal latency (the lag time  it takes for a signal to travel), but not necessarily high throughput (the amount of data a network  can process per second) while a use-case such as augmented reality will take more bandwidth.  30 https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/, accessed September 2019.  31 www.5gamericas.org/files/3214/7975/0104/5G_Americas_Network_Slicing_11.21_Final.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/ http://www.5gamericas.org/files/3214/7975/0104/5G_Americas_Network_Slicing_11.21_Final.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  24  With slicing, these needs can be accommodated by delegating each to its own network-within-  a-network.  Network Slicing components are presented in relation to the impacted elements of the network  architecture, as depicted in the various ‘Zoom-ins’. This cross-reference/mapping is an  alternative means for describing slice functions of 5G. The dependency of slices with the  various components of the 5G generic architecture is shown in the figure below:  Figure 4: Dependencies of slices with the generic 5G architecture components  The various slice functions of 5G are as follows:  Relevant element  Referenced generic 5G  architecture components  Slice function  Network Slice  Management Function  (NSMF)  Access Network, Core  Network  This function is responsible for  the management (including  lifecycle) of NSIs. It derives  network slice subnet related  requirements from the network  slice related requirements.

SDN Controller  Access Network, Core  Network  The NSI is realized via the  required physical and logical  resources.  the tenant SDN controller  dynamically configures the  (other) inner network slice's  VNFs, and properly chains them  to build up the Network  Service(s) that the slice needs to  accommodate for a given use  case.  NFV Orchestrator  Management and  Orchestration  Since SDN and NFV are  considered enabling techniques  for network slicing, MANO  activities are concerned with the  orchestration perspective that  involves transforming a service  using NFV infrastructure.  Each of the network slices  serving a tenant comprises an  NFVO.  The NFVO dynamically manages  the lifecycle of the network slice  constituent network service(s).  VNF Manager  Management and  Orchestration  VNF Manager is responsible for  VNF lifecycle management (e.g.  instantiation, update, query,  scaling and termination).  Each of the network slices  serving a tenant comprises one  or several VNFM(s).  The VNFM(s) perform(s) lifecycle  management operations over the  slice VNFs.  Operations Support  System/Business  Support System  (OSS/BSS)  Management and  Orchestration  Since Network Services and  VNF operations are highly  correlated, once it is made aware  by the NFVO that a Network  Service has been instantiated,  there is a need for the OSS, VNF  configuration and chaining tasks.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  26  Communication  Service Management  Function (CSMF)  Management and  Orchestration  This function is responsible for  translating the communication  service related requirement to  network slice related  requirements. The CSMF  communicates with the Network  Slice Management Function  (NSMF).  Os-Ma-nfvo Management and  orchestration, Resources  the Os-Ma-nfvo reference point  can be used for the interaction  between 3GPP slicing related  management functions and NFV-  MANO. To properly interface  with NFV-MANO, the NSMF  and/or NSSMF need to  determine the type of NS or set  of NSs, VNF and PNF that can  support the resource  requirements for a NSI or NSSI,  and whether new instances of  these NSs, VNFs and the  connectivity to the PNFs need to  be created or existing instances  can be re-used.  3.5 MANAGEMENT AND NETWORK ORCHESTRATOR (MANO) (ZOOM-  IN)  Management and Network Orchestrator is one of the most important components of the 5G  infrastructure. It is responsible for the configuration and management of all significant  components/functions of 5G, including Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Virtualised  Network Functions (VNF) management, and Virtualised Infrastructure Management (VIM). The  MANO structure presented here corresponds to the ETSI MANO concept.32  The structure of the MANO architecture is depicted in the following figure:  32 https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/slides/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/slides/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  27  Figure 5: MANO architecture zoom-in  A short description of the various elements of MANO shown in this figure is as follows:  Element Short description  NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) The NFV Orchestrator has two main responsibilities:   the orchestration of NFVI resources across multiple  VIMs and   the lifecycle management of Network Services.  VNF manager (VNFM)  The VNF Manager is responsible for the lifecycle  management of VNF instances.  Virtualised infrastructure  manager (VIM)  The Virtualised Infrastructure Manager (VIM) is responsible  for controlling and managing the NFVI computing, storage  and networking resources, usually within one operator's  Infrastructure Domain.  A VIM may be specialized in handling a certain type of  NFVI resource (e.g. compute-only, storage-only,  networking-only), or may be capable of managing multiple  types of NFVI resources (e.g. in NFVI-Nodes).  Element Management (EM) The Element Management is responsible for:  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  28  • Configuration for the network functions provided by the  VNF.  • Fault management for the network functions provided by  the VNF.  • Accounting for the usage of VNF functions.  • Collecting performance measurement results for the  functions provided by the VNF.  • Security management for the VNF functions.  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI). The NFVI encompasses all the hardware (e.g. compute,  storage, and networking) and software (e.g. hypervisors)  components that together provide the infrastructure  resources where VNFs are deployed.  Operations Support  System/Business Support  System (OSS/BSS)  OSS/BSS functions provide management and  orchestration of systems including legacy ones and may  have full end-to-end visibility of services provided by legacy  network functions in an operator's network.  Processes covered by OSS/BSS include: Network  Management, Service delivery / fulfilment / assurance,  Customer Relationship management and Billing.  NS Catalogue The NS Catalogue represents the repository of all of the  on-boarded Network Services, supporting the creation and  management of the NS deployment templates (Network  Service Descriptor (NSD), Virtual Link Descriptor (VLD),  and VNF Forwarding Graph Descriptor (VNFFGD) via  interface operations exposed by the NFVO.  VNF Catalogue The VNF Catalogue represents the repository of all of the  on-boarded VNF Packages, supporting the creation and  management of the VNF Package (VNF Descriptor  (VNFD), software images, manifest files, etc.) via interface  operations exposed by the NFVO.  NFV Instances repository The NFV Instances repository holds information of all VNF  instances and Network Service instances. Those records  are updated during the lifecycle of the respective instances,  reflecting changes resulting from execution of NS lifecycle  management operations and/or VNF lifecycle management  operations.  NFVI Resources repository As such, the NFVI Resources repository plays an important  role in supporting NFVO's Resource Orchestration and  governance role, by allowing NFVI reserved/allocated  resources to be tracked against the NS and VNF instances  associated with those resources (e.g. number of VMs used  by a certain VNF instance at any time during its lifecycle).

The SDAP architecture  includes a Packet Data Conversion Protocol (PDCP) located in the CU and an Air Radio Link  Control (ARLC) located in the DU. All this is based on IP transport on a TNL/Ethernet network,  very similar to the mobile backhaul of today. Another key aspect of the NG-RAN is the ability to  provide small-cell coverage to multiple operators ‘as-a-service’ in two-tier architecture. These  tiers are in support of the previously mentioned 5G use cases providing low latency services  and high processing power.  The structure of the RAN architecture is depicted in the figure below:  Figure 6: RAN architecture zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  30  The elements of the RAN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  User Equipment (UE) User equipment is any device used by users to  communicate within the 5G infrastructure. Besides a SIM,  user equipment may be home appliances of any kind (e.g.  computer, IoT devices,etc.).  Radio Unit (RU) Is an element connecting user equipment with the  operator network.  gNB Next generation Node/Base Station is a node providing  NR user plane and control plane protocol terminations  towards the UE, and connected via the NG interface to  the 5GC.  gNB Distributed Unit (gNB-  DU)  gNB-DU a logical node hosting RLC, MAC and PHY  layers of the gNB or en-gNB, and its operation is partly  controlled by gNB-CU. One gNB-DU supports one or  multiple cells. One cell is supported by only one gNB-DU.  The gNB-DU terminates the F1 interface connected with  the gNB-CU.  gNB Central Unit (gNB-CU) gNB-Central Unit (CU) is a logical node hosting RRC,  SDAP and PDCP protocols of the gNB or RRC and PDCP  protocols of the en-gNB that controls the operation of one  or more gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU terminates the F1  interface connected with the gNB-DU.  Access and Mobility  Management function  (AMF)  AMF is a Network Function (NF). It includes some or all  following functionalities:   Termination of RAN CP interface;   Termination of NAS ;   NAS ciphering and integrity protection;   Registration management;   Connection management;   Reachability management;   Mobility Management;   Lawful intercept;   Transport for SM messages between UE and SMF;   Transparent proxy for routing SM messages;   Access authentication; access authorization;   Transport for SMS messages between UE and  SMSF; security anchor functionality (SEAF) ;  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  31   Location services management; transport for  Location Services messages between UE and LMF  and between RAN and LMF;   EPS Bearer ID allocation for interworking with EPS:   UE mobility event notification.  F1 Logical interface with the F1 Application Protocol.

Non Access Stratum (NAS) NAS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE  and Core Network. (NAS) protocol for 5G System.  (defined in 3GPP TS 24.501). 28  Access Stratum (AS) AS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE  and RAN responsible for transporting data over the  wireless connection and managing radio resources.  3.7 NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALISATION (NFV) (ZOOM-IN)  NFV introduces a new concept for service providers to accelerate the deployment of new  network services in support of their revenue and growth plans. It translates to the use of  standard IT virtualisation technologies applied to the deployment of Network Functions, aiming  at a faster provision of new network services. With this, several providers formed the NFV ISG  under the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The foundation of NFV’s  basic requirements and architecture resulted from the work produced by ETSI NFV ISG. 36,37  Although 5G networks will be very different compared to its predecessors in some regards (e.g.  through the use of virtualisation and support for diverse and critical non-telecom-oriented  services), they still share similarities and will reuse and extend existing concepts that have  proved successful and are widely adopted.  The NFV has a tight interaction with Virtual Network Functions (VNF), MANO and OSS/BSS  and security management components. The NFV ‘Zoom-in’ presented in Figure 7 includes the  following network functions (NF):   Authentication Server Function (AUSF)   Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)   Unstructured Data Storage Function (UDSF)  33 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/138400_138499/138473/15.03.00_60/ts_138473v150300p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  34 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3225, accessed  September 2019.  35 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/138400_138499/138401/15.02.00_60/ts_138401v150200p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  36 https://www.etsi.org/technologies/nfv, accessed September 2019.  37 https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/?c_action=num_ball, accessed September 2019.  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/138400_138499/138473/15.03.00_60/ts_138473v150300p.pdf https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3225 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/138400_138499/138401/15.02.00_60/ts_138401v150200p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/technologies/nfv https://www.sdxcentral.com/networking/nfv/?c_action=num_ball  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  32   Network Exposure Function (NEF)   Network Repository Function (NRF)   Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF)   Policy Control Function (PCF)   Session Management Function (SMF)   Unified Data Management (UDM)   Unified Data Repository (UDR)   User Plane Function (UPF)   Application Function (AF)   5G-Equipment Identity Register (5G-EIR)   Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP)   Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF)  The structure of NFV architecture and its interfaces to related components is shown in the figure  below:  Figure 7: NFV architecture zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  33  The elements of the NFV architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  Operations Support  System/Business  Support System  (OSS/BSS)  OSS/BSS functions provide management and orchestration  of systems including legacy ones and may have full end-to-  end visibility of services, provided by legacy network  functions in an operator's network.  Processes covered by OSS/BSS include: Network  Management, Service delivery / fulfilment / assurance,  Customer Relationship management and Billing.  Virtualised Network  Function (VNF)  A VNF is a virtualisation of a network function in a legacy  non-virtualised network. ETSI GS NFV 001 provides a list of  use cases and examples of target network functions (NFs) for  virtualisation. Functional behaviour and state of a NF are  largely independent of whether the NF is virtualised or not.  The functional behaviour and the external operational  interfaces of a Physical Network Function (PNF) and a VNF  are expected to be the same.  Element Management  (EM)  The Element Management is responsible for:  • Configuration for the network functions provided by the  VNF.  • Fault management for the network functions provided by the  VNF.  • Accounting for the usage of VNF functions.  • Collecting performance measurement results for the  functions provided by the VNF.  • Security management for the VNF functions.  NFV Infrastructure  (NFVI)  The NFV Infrastructure corresponds to the total of all  hardware and software components which build up the  environment in which VNFs are deployed, managed and  executed. The NFV Infrastructure can span across several  locations, i.e. places where NFVI-PoPs are operated. The  network providing connectivity between these locations is  regarded to be part of the NFV Infrastructure. From the VNF's  perspective, the virtualisation layer and the hardware  resources look like a single entity providing the VNF with  desired virtualised resources.  Hardware Resources In NFV, the physical hardware resources include computing,  storage and network that provide processing, storage and  connectivity to VNFs through the virtualisation layer (e.g.  hypervisor). Computing hardware is assumed to be COTS as  opposed to purpose-built hardware. Storage resources can  be differentiated between shared network attached storage  (NAS) and storage that resides on the server itself.  Computing and storage resources are commonly pooled.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  34  Network resources are comprised of switching functions, e.g.  routers, and wired or wireless links.  Virtualisation Layer and  Virtualised Resources  The virtualisation layer abstracts the hardware resources and  decouples the VNF software from the underlying hardware,  thus ensuring a hardware independent lifecycle for the VNFs.  In short, the virtualisation layer is responsible for: •Abstracting  and logically partitioning physical resources, commonly as a  hardware abstraction layer. i) Enabling the software that  implements the VNF to use the underlying virtualised  infrastructure; ii) Providing virtualised resources to the VNF,  so that the latter can be executed.  Virtualised Infrastructure  Manager  From NFV's point of view, virtualised infrastructure  management comprises the functionalities that are used to  control and manage the interaction of a VNF with computing,  storage and network resources under its authority, as well as  their virtualisation. According to the list of hardware resources  specified in the architecture, the Virtualised Infrastructure  Manager performs resource and operations management.  Multiple Virtualised Infrastructure Manager instances may be  deployed.  NFV Orchestrator The NFV Orchestrator is in charge of the orchestration and  management of NFV infrastructure and software resources,  and realizing network services on NFVI  VNF Manager VNF Manager is responsible for VNF lifecycle management  (e.g. instantiation, update, query, scaling, termination).  Multiple VNF Managers may be deployed; a VNF Manager  may be deployed for each VNF, or a VNF Manager may  serve multiple VNFs.  Os-Ma-nfvo This reference point is used for exchanges between  OSS/BSS and NFV Orchestrator, and supports the following:  • Network Service Descriptor and VNF package  management.  • Network Service instance lifecycle management  • VNF lifecycle management  • Policy management and/or enforcement for Network  Service instances, VNF instances and NFVI resources  • Querying relevant Network Service instance and VNF  instance information from the OSS/BSS.  • Forwarding of events, accounting and usage records  and performance measurement results regarding  Network Service instances, VNF instances, and NFVI  resources to OSS/BSS, as well as and information  about the associations between those instances and  NFVI resources  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  35  Ve-Vnfm-em This reference point is used for exchanges between EM and  VNF Manager, and supports the following functions:  VNF instantiation / VNF instance query / VNF instance  update / VNF instance scaling out-in, and up-down / VNF  instance termination / Forwarding of configuration and events  from the EM to the VNFM / Forwarding of configuration and  events regarding the VNF from the VNFM to the EM.  NOTE: This reference point is only used if the EM is aware of  virtualisation.  Ve-Vnfm-vnf This reference point is used for exchanges between VNF and  VNF Manager, and supports the following:  VNF instantiation / VNF instance query / VNF instance  update / VNF instance scaling out-in, and up-down / VNF  instance termination / Forwarding of configuration and events  from the VNF to the VNFM / Forwarding of configuration,  events, etc. regarding VNF, from the VNFM to the VNF /  Verification that the VNF is still alive/functional.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (Nf-Vi)  This reference point is used for: Specific assignment of  virtualised resources in response to resource allocation  requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state  information (e.g. events) exchange.  NFV Security Manager  (NSM)  NSM is the logical functional block for overall security  management, e.g. on the behalf of network services. In  cooperation with MANO blocks dedicated to managing the  virtualised network, the policy driven NSM is specialized to  manage the security on a network service over its entire  lifecycle. It covers the following functionalities:  • Security Policy Planning, designs and optimizes security  policies for specific targets of protection (e.g. network  services).  • Security Policy Enforcement & Validation automates the  deployment and supports lifecycle management of  security functions as defined in the design phase, then  configure security policies on the security functions. In  addition, during lifetime of a network service, the  validation and re-configuration/remediation of  associated security policies is supported, also in  automated manner.  • NFVI Security Manager (ISM) – see below.  NFVI Security Manager  (ISM)  NFVI Security Manager is the logical function dedicated to  security management in NFVI layer. It builds and manages  the security in NFVI to support NSM requests for managing  security of network services in higher layer.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  36  Security Element  Manager (SEM)  SEM refers to Element Manager managing Security  Functions.  Virtual Security Function  (VSF)  This element is a special type of VNF running on top of NFVI  with tailored security functionality (e.g. firewall, IDS/IPS,  virtualised security monitoring functions like vFEP, vTap).  VSFs are mainly required to protect the other VNFs, which  constitute a network service. VSF is managed by either  dedicated VNFM or generic VNFM with respect to its  lifecycle.  NFVI-based Security  Function (ISF)  This element is a security function provided by the NFV  Infrastructure. It includes virtualised security appliances or  software security features (e.g. hypervisor-based firewalls)  and hardware-based security appliances/modules/features  (e.g. Hardware Security Modules, Crypto Accelerators, or  Trusted Platform Modules).  Physical Security  Function (PSF)  This element is a conventionally realized security function in  the physical part of the hybrid network. Even if a telco  network is virtualised, additional PSFs are still needed, for  instance to protect the NFV infrastructure (and inherently, the  Network Services running on top) as a whole. PSF is part of  the non-virtualised traditional network and not maintained by  the NFVI provider, hence it is managed by the SEM instead  of the VIM.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (NF-Vi)  This reference point is used for: Specific assignment of  virtualised resources in response to resource allocation  requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state  information (e.g. events) exchange.  3.8 SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORK (SDN) (ZOOM-IN)  5G will be driven by the influence of software managing network functions, known as Software  Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV). The key concept that  underpins SDNs is the logical centralisation of network control functions by decoupling the  control and packet-forwarding functionality of the network. While SDN separates the control and  forwarding planes, NFV primarily focuses on optimising the network services themselves. NFV  complements this vision through the virtualisation of these functionalities based on recent  advances in general server and enterprise IT virtualisation. The SDN threats presented in this  document are also the ones described in the ENISA Thematic Landscape SDN/5G38Error!  Bookmark not defined..  As previously mentioned, the fundamental concept of SDN relies on decoupling the control and  the packet forwarding functionality in the network. In classic networks, these two functionalities  are under the responsibility of the forwarding devices (physical) of the network. In SDN, these  two functionalities have been separated into two functionality planes: the control plane and the  38 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape, accessed October 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  37  data plane. The separation of these two functionality planes in SDNs has two significant  consequences:  a) it reduces the difficulty in the configuration and alteration of the control functions of the  network, as this functionality has no longer the responsibility of the forwarding devices  of the network that tend to have proprietary implementations (e.g., operating systems),  and  b) it enables the implementation of more consistent control policies through fewer and  uniformly accessible controllers.  The typical SDN architecture, as described by the Open Networking Foundation,39 is shown in  the figure below:  Figure 8: SDN architecture zoom-in  39 https://www.opennetworking.org/, accessed September 2019.  https://www.opennetworking.org/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  38  The elements of the SDN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  SDN controller SDN Controller: The SDN Controller is a logically centralized entity  in charge of:  • Translating the requirements from the SDN Application layer  down to the SDN Resources and  • Providing the SDN Applications with an abstract view of the  network (which may include statistics and events).  SDN Application SDN Applications are programs that explicitly, directly, and  programmatically communicate their network requirements and  desired network behaviour to the SDN Controller.  Multiple case  scenarios might be envisioned, for the position of the SDN  applications in the NFV architectural framework, such as:  • the network hardware might be a physical appliance talking to  an SDN controller, or a complete solution including multiple  SDN components, such as SDN controller + SDN application  for instance;  • the VIM might be an application interfacing with an SDN  controller in the NFVI - for instance OpenStack Neutron as a  VIM interfacing with an SDN controller in the NFVI;  • the SDN application might be a VNF talking to an SDN  controller, being Virtualised or not. For instance a PCRF VNF  might talk to an SDN controller for some policy management  for traffic steering;  • the SDN application might be an element manager interfacing  with an SDN controller to collect some metrics or configure  some parameters, and  • the SDN application might be an application interfacing with  an SDN controller for instance in the OSS-BSS for tenant  SDN service definitions.  SDN resources Multiple scenarios might be envisaged for the actual location of  SDN resources:  • physical switch or router;  • virtual switch or router;  • e-switch, software based SDN enabled switch in a server NIC  and  • switch or router as a Virtual network function (VNF).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  39  3.9 MULTI-ACCESS EDGE COMPUTING (MEC) (ZOOM-IN)  Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) stands for the provision of cloud computing capabilities at  the edge of the network, that is, for high bandwidth, low latency end- user applications.40 MEC is  located in the logical vicinity of base stations through authorised third parties willing to offer  processing and storage capabilities to subscribers of the 5G network. MEC is a novel approach  in the 5G ecosystem that enhances mobile user experience by covering services that, in  previous generations, were using the run-time of end-user devices.  Through the capabilities of MEC, a variety of services can be bundled/converged into a single  component, such as video, location services, virtual reality, etc. It is expected that MEC is going  to emerge following the evolution of application services and verticals and will be one of the  main drivers for a wider coverage and penetration of 5G Networks.  Besides offering these services, MEC takes an important role in the 5G infrastructure. It  possesses orchestration functions, interacts with the 5G policy component and supports life-  cycle matters of the offered applications.  The structure of MEC and its elements is shown in the figure below:  Figure 9: MEC architecture zoom-in  40 https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing?jjj=1568718105743, accessed September 2019.  https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing?jjj=1568718105743  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  40  The elements of MEC are as follows:  Element Short description  Customer facing service  (CFS) portal  The customer facing service portal allows operators' third-  party customers (e.g. commercial enterprises) to select and  order a set of MEC applications that meet their particular  needs, and to receive back service level information from the  provisioned applications.  Device application Device applications as defined in the present document are  applications in the device (e.g. UE, laptop with internet  connectivity) that have the capability to interact with the MEC  system via a user application lifecycle management proxy.  User application life-  cycle management  (LCM) proxy  The user application lifecycle management proxy allows  device applications to request on-boarding, instantiation,  termination of user applications and when supported,  relocation of user applications in and out of the MEC system.  It also allows informing the device applications about the  state of the user applications.  The user application lifecycle  management proxy authorizes requests from device  applications in the device and interacts with the OSS and the  multi-access edge orchestrator for further processing of these  requests.  Multi-access edge  orchestrator  The multi-access edge orchestrator is the core functionality in  MEC system level management, responsible for the following  functions: maintaining an overall view of the MEC system; on-  boarding of application packages; selecting appropriate MEC  host(s) for application instantiation; triggering application  instantiation and termination; triggering application relocation  as needed when supported.  MEC host MEC host is an entity that contains a MEC platform and a  virtualisation infrastructure which provides compute, storage,  and network resources, for the purpose of running MEC  applications.  Virtualisation  infrastructure  It provides compute, storage, and network resources for the  MEC applications. The virtualisation infrastructure includes a  data plane that executes the traffic rules received by the MEC  platform, and routes the traffic among applications, services,  DNS server/proxy, 3GPP network, other access networks,  local networks and external networks.  MEC platform It is the collection of essential functionality required to run  MEC applications on a particular virtualisation infrastructure  and enable them to provide and consume MEC services. The  MEC platform can also provide services.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  41  MEC applications MEC applications are instantiated on the virtualisation  infrastructure of the MEC host, based on configuration or  requests validated by the MEC management.  MEC service It is a service provided via the MEC platform either by the  MEC platform itself or by a MEC application.  Service registry In MEC, the services produced by the MEC applications are  registered in the service registry of the MEC platform – as  opposed to the network functions and the services they  produce which are registered in the Network Resource  Function (NRF).  Data Plane Data plane described in this diagram is only a representation  of the execution environment for the traffic rules and routing.  Mapping of all or part of MEC data plane functionality to any  functional element(s) of a real network architecture implies a  specific deployment option of MEC in such a network  architecture.  MEC host level  management  It handles the management of the MEC specific functionality  of a particular MEC host and the applications running on it. Is  comprised of the MEC platform manager and the  virtualisation infrastructure manager.  MEC platform manager  The MEC platform manager is responsible for the following  functions:  • Managing the life cycle of applications including  informing the multi-access edge orchestrator of relevant  application related events;  • Providing element management functions to the MEC  platform and  • Managing the application rules and requirements.  The MEC platform manager also receives virtualised  resources fault reports and performance measurements from  the virtualisation infrastructure manager for further  processing.  Virtualisation  infrastructure manager  The functionality provided by the virtualisation infrastructure  manager in this ‘Zoom-in’ overlaps generally with the  functionality provided by the VIM described in the NFV  ‘Zoom-in’.  Inter-MEC system  communication  Inter MEC systems communication is implementing three  interfaces that are necessary for the communication between  various MECs. In particular:  • A MEC platform should be able to discover other MEC  platforms that may belong to different MEC systems;  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  42  • A MEC platform should be able to exchange information  in a secure manner with other MEC platforms that may  belong to different MEC systems.  • A MEC application should be able to exchange  information in a secure manner with other MEC  applications that may belong to different MEC systems.  3.10 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE (SA) (ZOOM-IN)  The 5G security architecture consists of various network functions (NF) and components that  are responsible for securing end-to-end communications, providing authentication functions and  various other security functions. The 5G security architecture consists of components that are  part of various other architectures (‘Zoom-ins’ in terms of this report), acting thus in a horizontal  manner across all other architectures. In particular, security functions are securing the access of  users within the radio access network (RAN), they cover security functions in the core network  and perimeter entities (edge computing) and they provide security functions in the Network  Function Virtualisation (NFV). Finally, a set of elements is covering security management  functions, audit and analytics.  The detailed structure of the 5G security architecture is shown in the following figure:  Figure 10: 5G Security Architecture zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  43  The elements of the 5G security architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  Mobile Equipment (ME) ME stands for all kinds of mobile equipment that can be  connected to the 5G network. ME can be sensors, IoT  components, connected autonomous systems, eHealth  devices, etc.  Universal Subscriber  Identity Module (USIM)  USIM is the SIM card of 5G.It is a platform for securing  access and communication in 5G. It is the only security  module mentioned in 3GPP specification.  5G Node Base Station  Central Unit (gNB-CU)  Some security requirements for gNB-CU have been  formulated by 3GPPP. Though not a security element per  se, these requirements increase the security properties of  gNB and – when implemented - are considered to be  relevant to the security architecture.  Non-3GPP Access  Network  Security for non-3GPP access to the 5G Core network is  achieved by a procedure using IKEv2 as defined in RFC  7296 to set up one or more IPsec ESP security  associations. The role of IKE initiator (or client) is taken by  the UE, and the role of IKE responder (or server) is taken  by the N3IW.  Security Anchor Function  (SEAF)  The SEAF will create for the primary authentication a  unified anchor key KSEAF (common for all accesses) that  can be used by the UE and the serving network to protect  the subsequent communication41.  Authentication server  function (AUSF)  The Authentication server function (AUSF) shall handle  authentication requests for both, 3GPP access and non-  3GPP access. The AUSF shall provide SUPI to the VPLMN  only after authentication confirmation if authentication  request with SUCI was sent by VPLMN. The AUSF shall  inform the UDM that a successful or unsuccessful  authentication of a subscriber has occurred.  Authentication credential  Repository and  Processing Function  (ARPF)  ARPF selects an authentication method based on  subscriber identity and configured policy and computes the  authentication data and keying materials  Subscription Identifier De-  concealing Function  (SIDF)  The SIDF is responsible for de-concealment of the  Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) and shall fulfil the  following requirements:  • The SIDF shall be a service offered by UDM.  41  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b 116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  44  • The SIDF shall resolve the SUPI from the SUCI  based on the protection scheme used to generate the  SUCI.  Security Edge Protection  Proxy (SEPP)  The 5G System architecture introduces a Security Edge  Protection Proxy (SEPP) as the entity sitting at the  perimeter of the mobile network. The SEPP shall act as a  non-transparent proxy node.  NFV Security Services  Agent (SSA)  The NFV SSA exists in both the NFVI domain and in VNF  domain. NFV SSA in VNF domain may exist as a separate  VSF, or within a VNF. The NFV SSA is responsible for  securely receiving the Security Monitoring policy and  implementing the same.  NFV Security Controller  (SC)  The NFV SC may interface with other security systems  (e.g. Security Analytics), security databases and other  policy engines. The NFV SC orchestrates system wide  security policies. The NFV SC acts as a trusted 3rd party  that resides independently.  An NFV SC manages NFV SSAs (like VSFs) to keep them  in a consistent state according to the policy specified. SC  also facilitates secure bootstrapping of SSAs (like VSFs),  managing instances of SSAs, secure pairing up with SSA's  VNFMs and EMs, personalize the SSAs, policy  management, integrity assertion, credential management,  facilitate clustering of multiple SSAs into a distributed  appliance, monitoring of SSAs for failure and remediation.  NFV Security Services  Provider (SSP)  The NFV SSP is located within the VIM and VNFM, and is  responsible for security monitoring policy orchestration  received from the Security Controller (NFV SC) and  interacting with the various VIM/VNFM components to  implement the policy across various systems comprising  the NFVI/VNF. Furthermore, NFV SSP is also responsible  for receiving the telemetry data from various NFV SSAs,  and optionally making some analysis based on this data.  NFV Security Monitoring  Database  The NFV SecM-DB is a secure database consisting of  security data used for deploying NFV system wide Security  Monitoring. This includes Security Monitoring policy and  configurations, security credentials for facilitating secure  communications between the various Security Monitoring  components, and credentials for secure storage of  telemetry, including tenant-specific security policies.  SA/VSF Catalog Database  (VSF-NVNF-CAT)  The NFV VSF-VNF-CAT is a repository for Security  Services Agents like the Virtual Security Functions (VSF)  VNFs. The catalogue has capability to add and remove  SSAs (VSF) packages and/or images, and also includes a  VSF VNFD containing meta data and information about  that VSF VNF. Once the SSA (VSF) package or instance is  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  45  added to the catalogue, it becomes available for  orchestration.  Audit DB The NFV AUD-DB is a secure database consisting of  security audit information.  Security Monitoring  Analytics System  The Security Monitoring Analytics system securely receives  Security Monitoring telemetry from across the NFV  systems, including the MANO and all the NFVIs that may  be geographically distributed. The analytics system applies  advanced machine learning techniques on the telemetry to  perform advanced detection of security anomalies and  emerging threats in the system. This system also can  trigger remediation actions through the NFV SC.  Subscription Concealed  Identifier (SUCI)  A one-time use subscription identifier, which contains the  Scheme-Output, and additional non-concealed information  needed for home network routing and protection scheme  usage.  Authentication Vector A vector consisting of RAND, authentication Token (AUTN)  and Hash eXpected RESponse (HXRES).  Anchor Key The security key KSEAF provided during authentication  and used for derivation of subsequent security keys.  Key Hierarchy Hierarchy of cryptographic key derived from Anchor Key.  (as defined in ETSI TS 133 501 section 6.2.) 42 It includes  the following keys: KAUSF, KSEAF, KAMF, KNASint,  KNASenc, KN3IWF, KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint  and KUPenc.  3.11 5G PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most important aspects in the transition from previous generations of mobile  telecommunications into 5G is the ‘softwarisation’ of network functions, previously performed by  physical appliances. Furthermore, some of these physical components were mostly proprietary  and incompatible with other solutions. With 5G, the network software can run in any  commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, making MNOs less dependent on manufacturers.  This significant change will allow great scalability, quicker deployments, cost efficiency and  integration between different components of the network. However, the high level of  virtualisation will increase the impact of failures: a shared physical component will serve multiple  functions (e.g. virtual functions, slicing, user equipment functions, etc.), playing thus a significant  role in the service provisioning chain. At the same time this also greatly increases the  complexity of the software implementation, which itself is associated with new threats.  Nonetheless, the physical 5G architecture is going to remain exposed to more generic threats  that are pertinent to physical components, such as: damage/theft, sabotage, natural disasters,  outages, failures and malfunctions, just to name the most important ones. While in previous  42 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  46  mobile networks such failures had a more ‘restricted’ influence in service provisioning, with the  5G virtualisation failures of physical components may have an amplified impact, typical to  shared resources. This fact increases the criticality of 5G physical infrastructure components, as  multiple services are going to depend on them.  The 5G physical infrastructure is depicted in the following figure:  Figure 11: 5G physical architecture zoom-in  The physical architecture shows all hardware components required for:   Enterprise Network (out of scope of this report apart from UE);   Radio Access Network consisting of RAN-CU, C-RAN MEC and mmWave routers;   Transport network (backhaul) consisting of Edge Could, and SDN controller/switches and   Data centre consisting of Central Cloud, MANO and SND controllers.  Note that this architecture does not contain details of some (important) security related  hardware components such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Secure Execution Engines  (SEE), Trusted Execution Engines (TEE), Trusted Platform Module (TPM), etc. These  components are not entirely covered in 5G specifications considered in this report and may be  added in future versions of this report.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  47  4. 5G ASSETS  4.1 METHODOLOGICAL CONVENTIONS  As commonly defined, an asset is anything that has value to an individual or organisation and  therefore requires protection. Besides being valuable to an organisation, assets may contribute  to the fulfilment of legal obligations,  In a typical ICT system, assets can be:  a) hardware, software and communication components;  b) communication links between them;  c) data that control the function of the system, are produced and/or consumed by it, or  flow within it;  d) the physical and organisational infrastructure within which the 5G system is deployed,  and;  e) the human agents who interact with the system and may affect its operation (e.g.,  users, system administrators etc.).  Due to its value, a digital asset becomes a target for threat agents. Threat agents are human or  software agents, which may wish to abuse, compromise and/or damage assets. Threat agents  may perform attacks, which create threats that pose risks to assets.  In the overview of 5G assets provided in the remainder of this report, we have classified assets  into different categories, described in section 4.2. Furthermore, we have grouped assets  according to their position within the 5G architecture and their exposure.  4.2 ASSET CATEGORIES  5G assets have been derived from the provided architecture, including the details depicted in  the various ‘Zoom-ins’. The asset diagram is structured using asset groups according to their  exposure to threats. By taking into account the role of assets in maintaining the security-related  properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity (known as CIA triad),43,44 an initial  assessment of their importance has been developed. In doing so, the emphasis has been given  to asset groups responsible for maintaining the overall security and availability of the 5G  infrastructure and that are known targets of cyber-attacks.  In the present chapter, we present the various assets categories used for structuring 5G assets,  together with a mapping showing the role of these asset categories for maintaining the CIA  security properties. A detailed asset decomposition diagram with all 5G assets considered in  this threat landscape can be found in Annex A.  The asset categories are shown in Figure 12 and their content is as follows:  Policy: Policy Control Functions (PCF) are performing provisioning, management of sessions  related to consumer functions. These functions can be used for charging control (e.g. usage  and charging), policy control and application detection control.45 The functions are applied to  43 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security, accessed September 2019.  44 https://geek-university.com/ccna-security/confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-cia-triad/, accessed September 2019.  45 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/129500_129599/129512/15.01.00_60/ts_129512v150100p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security https://geek-university.com/ccna-security/confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-cia-triad/ https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/129500_129599/129512/15.01.00_60/ts_129512v150100p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  48  data flow detection, gating, Quality of Service traffic screening, etc. Given their role in the  management of policy issues related to consumers, these functions may be targeted in order to  influence monetary matters (charging) of 5G network usage.  Management processes: This asset group summarizes important processes assigned to  development, deployment and operation of the entire set of components of the 5G  infrastructure. They include configuration, network management, software development  process, continuity, key and access rights management, etc. it seems that these processes will  play a significant role in guaranteeing security and trust in 5G operations, and in component  development in particular.46,47 Some certifications based on process-level assurance schemes  for 5G have been already announced.48  Business applications: Similar to previous generation mobile networks, these assets are  representing commissioning and customer relationship management that are necessary in order  to implement business-related matters within the 5G Network (referred to as Operational  Support Systems – OSS and Business Support Systems – BSS). Such functions will be  implemented through policy control functions. Being a vital part of customer maintenance and  billing purposes, the assets in this category are exposed to manipulation (integrity) attacks.  Confidentiality of subscriber information might also be targeted by attacks.  Business services: In a 5G context, this asset group refers to the components required to  deliver a specific service that is monetized by a provider and/or MNO. An example is the  delivery of horizontal, business, government, critical and emergency services.  Protocols: This asset group represents (main) communication protocols used within the 5G  infrastructure. It covers protocols that are used in network communications, radio  communications and security. Knowingly, protocols are common attack points with a series of  threats, such as reconnaissance, eavesdropping, SYN flood, replay and man-in-the-middle  attacks.  Data network: This asset group represents the connectivity to external data, content, services  and other resources available outside the 5G network. The data network is also used to  interconnect different 5G networks, operators and providers.  Slicing: This asset group represents all 5G functions that are responsible for the creation and  management of slicing. Slices are virtualised independent logical networks that carry out the  network communication between the user equipment and 5G services. Slices are end-to-end  network communication links that are virtually multiplexed and mapped to resources of the  virtualised physical network platform. While 4G allowed for APN (Access Point Name), in 5G  slicing is taking place initially on a static base and later on a dynamic basis. Slicing is  considered as one of the main advantages of 5G networks enabling low network latency.  Data: With this asset group, the entire data household for the operation of 5G are covered,  notably confidential and/or security-related 5G data. Though not necessarily exhaustive at this  stage of the analysis, this asset group covers information related to: user data, system and  configuration data, security-related data, network data (configuration, edge, logs, API-data,  SDN-data, etc.). It is expected that 5G data such as user, security and configuration information  46 https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/1569-secam_for_3gpp_nodes, accessed September 2019.  47 https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/, accessed September 2019.  48 https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FS.14-NESAS-Security-Test-Laboratory- Accreditation-Pilot-Release_0.7.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/1569-secam_for_3gpp_nodes https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/ https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FS.14-NESAS-Security-Test-Laboratory-Accreditation-Pilot-Release_0.7.pdf https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FS.14-NESAS-Security-Test-Laboratory-Accreditation-Pilot-Release_0.7.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  49  will be subject to cyber-attacks with the aim to breach them. Main motives are monetization and  unnoticed access to the network.  Human assets: Considered as one of the most important asset groups, human assets  represent all individuals involved in the operation and use of the 5G network. Under this asset  category, we include operator’s staff (including tenants and security operators), 3rd party  personnel and end-users. Of particular importance are operator and 3rd party data that are  related to administration credentials. Members of this asset group may be involved in insider  threat, information leakage and unintentional damages through errors.  Time: Time is an important asset group within 5G networks. It plays a significant role in many  time-dependent functions (e.g. quality of service, network management, virtualisation  management, etc.). The most critical interplay between time and network functions concerns  security functions (such as key management, encryption and timestamps). Time inaccuracies  may lead to failures and manipulations that can have far-reaching consequences to the  availability of network functions. It is worth mentioning that the reduction of time inaccuracies in  5G has not yet been fully addressed in the current specifications and 5G virtualisation practices.  Legal: Assets of this category are related to various contractual agreements and Intellectual  Property Rights (IPRs), that are either subject to bilateral of service provisioning among various  5G stakeholders or are related to IPR rights of the used services and components. Several  cyber-threats, especially the ones that may lead to service unavailability and/or degradation  may significantly affect these assets. Such an impact will have legal and monetary  consequences for the party failing to provide their agreed services.  Legacy: This asset group encompasses all legacy systems connected to the 5G network or  used within migration paths (e.g. from 2G to 5G). This asset group includes physical network  functions (PNFs), service gateways, management entities, packet gateways, legacy protocols,  legacy encryption infrastructure, etc. This asset group is exposed to unintentional damage  threats and such that are concerned with the management of phased-out components (e.g.  software and configuration maintenance).  Data storage/repository: This asset encompasses all assets (mainly network functions) that  implement the persistence of and access to the stored 5G data. Though not fully exhaustive at  this stage of the analysis, it covers the unified data repository function (UDF) and the storage  functions for security-related information (catalogue database, security monitoring database and  audit database). Due to its importance for the entire system security, this asset group may be  subject to attacks aiming at compromising sensitive system information.  Physical infrastructure: This asset group includes all physical assets of 5G, mainly IT  components, cabling and data centres and user equipment. More precisely, assets grouped in  this category are network hardware, cloud and operator data centres, user equipment of all  kinds, and radio access hardware. Despite the virtualised structure of the 5G network and all  involved network functions, there will be a strong dependency on the physical infrastructure,  especially in the initial migration/hybrid 5G deployments. Moreover, to deliver the required  security services, some cryptographic hardware components at the data centre will play a  critical role, while at the same time being potential points of failure. The entire physical  infrastructure can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter (see  chapter 3.11).  Management and orchestration (MANO): This asset group stands for the entire set of assets  related to management and orchestration. MANO is considered to be the most critical part of the  5G infrastructure as it is responsible for managing the entire set of network functions, their  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  50  virtualisation and entire software life-cycle related hereto. The main parts of MANO are the  Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) orchestrator, the Virtual Network Function (VNF)  manager, and the virtualised infrastructure manager. Given its important role, MANO is going to  be exposed to numerous attacks with potentially major impact on the entire managed 5G  infrastructure environment. The assets of MANO are also depicted in detail in the corresponding  ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter (see chapter 3.5).  Radio Access Network (RAN): This asset group represents the logical components making up  the functions of the Radio Access Network (RAN hardware is not part of this asset group). It  includes mainly distribution unit and control unit of radio access. The RAN components and  their interconnections can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture  chapter (see chapter 3.6).  Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV): This asset group contains all network functions that  are virtualised to depart from proprietary dedicated hardware. NFV is a 5G specific architecture  that virtualises classes of network node functions and physical network functions (PNF) into  blocks that take over the entire connectivity actions necessary for communication services. This  asset group also includes all security functions, that is, functions that cope will all the required  authentication, monitoring and subscription. Security functions are considered particularly  sensitive, as they use key material to perform operations. As such, they will be exposed to  attacks aiming at breaching this information and compromise the entire security part of the 5G  network. The entire NFV structure can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G  architecture chapter (see chapter 3.7).  Software Defined Networks (SDN): This group contains the assets related to the SDN network  controller, virtual network switches, data plane, application plane and control plane. Detailed  information about SDN assets can be found in a previous ENISA thematic threat landscape  covering SDN38. The contents of this report are still valid and can be used to obtain information  about threat exposure and threat mitigation w.r.t. these assets. Due to its importance for 5G,  SDN is considered within this document for completeness purposes. Due to its important role for  the setup and management of the entire virtualised 5G network, SDN is regarded as a key  component for the availability and integrity of network functions. The entire SDN architecture  can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter (see chapter 3.8).  References to SDN functions used from within other parts of the 5G architecture are shown in  the various other ‘Zoom ins’ (e.g. NFV ‘Zoom-in’).  Lawful Interception (LI): Lawful Interception assets are concerned with the 5G functions  implementing all provisions for performing lawful surveillance, providing thus legally sanctioned  access to 5G private communications of all kinds. Interested readers can find detailed  information on 5G LI provisions in this document.49,50 Though not analysed much further in this  document, these functions deserve special attention as they do provide any information  processed in 5G networks. As such, LI (related functions and data) is a target for manipulations  and other malicious actions (e.g. unlawful surveillance, weaponisation of interception,  manipulation of information, etc.).  Transport: Transport assets represent all communication channels used for network transfer.  This asset group includes satellite communication, fibre optics communication, micro-waves  communication, Ethernet, as well as wireless and Near Field Communication (NFC). These  assets are crucial for the availability of communication. However, with the virtualisation of the  49 http://statewatch.org/news/2019/jun/eu-council-ctc-5g-law-enforcement-8983-19.pdf, accessed September 2019.  50 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  http://statewatch.org/news/2019/jun/eu-council-ctc-5g-law-enforcement-8983-19.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  51  network architecture, transport becomes less important compared with previous generations of  mobile communications.  Virtualisation: The role of virtualisation functions in 5G is crucial. With this asset group, we  summarise assets that are related to virtual machine technologies and the hypervisor. Due to  the massive virtualisation in 5G, these two components are decisive for the functionality of the  entire network. Given the trend of using common open-source software for these two  components, new vulnerabilities, when exploited, will multiply attack impact in the underlying  technology platform. It is expected that hypervisors will be subject to attacks. With the ability to  access and manage computer memory, attackers may access cryptographic material in case of  operations performed in this memory (i.e. absence of dedicated crypto-hardware).  Cloud: Cloud technology will be extensively used within the 5G architecture, either through the  provisioning of SaaS or IaaS. In the asset diagram, this group contains the logical cloud  services. The hardware part related to cloud is covered in the physical infrastructure asset  group. Cloud will be used as a platform by tenants to control storage and processing resources.  Existing threats targeting cloud, when materialized, may unveil multiple confidential information,  while at the same time affecting the availability of the entire 5G infrastructure.  Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC): This group consists of assets related to the  decentralisation of cloud functions (storage of data and computing) located closer to the user or  edge device. This group is further decomposed within this document using a specialised ‘Zoom-  in’ of the 5G architecture (see chapter 3.9). This material can be used to decompose this asset  group further.  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are  of great importance to the 5G ecosystem as they enable the exposure of functionalities across  different networks. It allows applications and services to program network functions, to  interconnect various networks and operators. 5G is also responsible for the introduction of  REST API concept into telecommunications systems. REST,51 which stands for  Representational State Transfer is a set of constraints that, when applied to the design of a  system, creates a software architectural style. The exposure of functionalities is a common  concept used by modern software design, especially for web-services which are offered over  the internet. REST APIs are defined along with a number of common principles which are  referred to as REST architectural style.  Security Controls: This asset group contains some of the security controls that are relevant for  communication networks in general and 5G in particular. They include, but are not limited to:  incident management, DoS protection, intrusion prevention, intrusion detection, firewalling,  network traffic analysis and security edge protection proxy. As these controls are key for the  security of the network, they are considered as exposed to a variety of cyberthreats and are  expected to be targets of attacks. Knowing that the mentioned controls are far from being  exhaustive, they are a first attempt to enlist basic 5G security measures, also referenced within  various specifications/5G architectures. Although they could be considered as security controls  too, this asset group does not contain parts of the 5G security architecture, which are subsumed  under network functions. The 5G security architecture was also depicted in a ‘Zoom-in’ (see  chapter 3.10). In future versions of the 5G threat landscape, this asset group will be amended  with additional assets (i.e. mitigation measures). This amendment will follow ongoing work in  standardisation committees upon publication and will be subject to future versions of the 5G  threat landscape.  51 https://www.riverpublishers.com/journal/journal_articles/RP_Journal_2245-800X_617.pdf, accessed August 2019.  https://www.riverpublishers.com/journal/journal_articles/RP_Journal_2245-800X_617.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  52  Figure 13: Used 5G asset categories  In the following table, we provide the relevance of the identified asset groups with regard to the  CIA triad.

We  recommend performance of this exercise in higher detail, depending on the focus of prospective  threat assessments. In this case, to achieve a more precise mapping, users of this document  should obtain a more accurate internal evaluation of these properties.  Concluding this chapter, it is worth mentioning that due to its complexity and the early stage of 5G  networks (development, deployment, specification) the asset mapping is an ongoing task that will  need some time to reach a mature stage. This is due to a variety of reasons/issues regarding the  parameters of current 5G activities (narrow time windows for the creation of reports, resource  issues, knowledge transfer, vendor’s enrolment, etc.). These challenges will be sufficiently  managed in future assessment of 5G threats.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  54  5. 5G THREATS  5G introduces significant innovation to mobile networks by integrating multiple and different  types of technologies. While these are unquestionable benefits, the risks and threats are yet to  be fully unserstood. The complexity and extension of the attack surface – as described in  section 4.2 and presented in Annex A - makes the activity of accurately defining the 5G threat  landscape a laborious task. The 5G threat landscape combines traditional IP-based threats with  the all-5G network (core, access and edge), insecure legacy 2/3/4G generations and threats  introduced by virtualisation technology.  5.1 TAXONOMY OF THREATS  The list below presents a list of high-level categorization of threats based on ENISA threat  taxonomy.   Nefarious activity/abuse (NAA): This threat category is defined as “intended actions  that target ICT systems, infrastructure, and networks by means of malicious acts with  the aim to either steal, alter, or destroy a specified target”.   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking (EIH): This threat category is defined as  “actions aiming to listen, interrupt, or seize control of a third party communication  without consent”.   Physical attacks (PA): This threat category is defined as “actions which aim to  destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to physical assets  such as infrastructure, hardware, or interconnection”.   Damage (DAM): This threat category is defined as intentional actions aimed at  causing “ destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure or  reduction in usefulness”.   Unintentional Damage (UD): This threat category is defined as unintentional actions  aimed at causing “destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a  failure or reduction in usefulness”.   Failures or malfunctions (FM): This threat category is defined as “Partial or full  insufficient functioning of an asset (hardware or software)”.   Outages (OUT): This threat category is defined as “unexpected disruptions of service  or decrease in quality falling below a required level“.   Disaster (DIS): This threat category is defined as “a sudden accident or a natural  catastrophe that causes great damage or loss of life”.   Legal (LEG): This threat category is defined as “legal actions of third parties  (contracting or otherwise), in order to prohibit actions or compensate for loss based on  applicable law”.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  55  In addition to the above general taxonomy, we also categorise threats depending on whether  the exploitation target is part of core network, radio access, network virtualisation or generic  infrastructure component. Based on this criterion, threats can be further categorised into:   Core Network threats: These threats relate to elements of the Core Network that  includes SDN, NVF, NS and MANO. The majority fall under the categories of  ‘Nefarious activity/abuse’ and ‘Eavesdropping/ Interception/ Hijacking’. 5G Core  Network threats are described in detail in section 5.2.   Access network threats: These threats relate to the 5G radio access technology  (RAT), radio access network (RAN) and non-3GPP access technologies. These  include threats related to the wireless medium and radio transmission technology. The  majority of the threats fall under the categories of ‘Eavesdropping/Interception/  Hijacking’. Access network threats are described in more detail in section 5.3.   Multi-edge computing threats: These threats relate to components located at the  edge of the network. The majority fall under the categories of ‘Nefarious activity/abuse’  and ‘Eavesdropping/ Interception/ Hijacking’. 5G Multi Edge Computing threats are  described in detail in section 5.4.   Virtualisation threats: These are threats related to the virtualisation of the underlying  IT infrastructure, network and functions. Virtualisation threats are described in more  detail in section 5.5.   Physical Infrastructure threats: These are threats related to the underlying IT  infrastructure that supports the network. The majority fall under the categories of  ‘Physical attacks’, ‘Damage or loss of equipment’, ‘Equipment failures or malfunctions’,  ‘Outages’, ‘Disaster’. Physical infrastructure threats are described in more detail in  section 5.6.   Generic threats: These are threats that typically affect any ICT system or network.  The generic threats are important to mention since these help defining and framing the  ones specific to 5G. As an example: many 5G specific threats may result in a network  service shutdown that in general terms is defined as a Denial of Service (DoS) threat.  The Generic threats are described in more detail in section 5.7.   SDN threats: These are threats related to the SDN functions that are omnipresent in  the entire 5G infrastructure. For this document, we build on the threats identified in the  ENISA Thematic Landscape SDN/5G.  5.2 CORE NETWORK THREATS  Abuse of remote access: This threat consists of a malicious actor having remote access to  critical network components and take control of a virtual machine to perform other types of  attacks. Remote access is a standard practice within the tech industry, to facilitate maintenance  and operational procedures performed in clients. By gaining illegal access to the remote access  function, a malicious actor can connect to operating systems and applications, in a critical  domain of the network. With access to a machine in the network, a malicious actor can engage  in other activities such as tampering configuration data and distribution of malware.  Authentication traffic spikes: This threat relates to a massive number of authentication  requests sent by a malicious actor in a short time. A malicious actor initiates traffic spikes or  emphasizes the effects of natural traffic spikes with IoT devices aiming to connect.  Consequently, the network will experience more signalling and authentication requests that is  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  56  capable of handling. This kind of attack may be considered as a special case of denial of  (authentication) service. Potentially, the authentication of authorized devices may fail resulting in  the loss of connectivity.53  Abuse of user authentication/authorization data. This threat relates to the disclosure of long-  term keys for authentication and security controls conducted by an insider or hostile or  untrustworthy personnel operating in the Core Network.  Abuse of third party hosted network functions: This threat relates to availability issues and  disclosure of sensitive data due to core network functions hosted on third-party cloud service  providers’ systems. An untrustworthy cloud service provider could access, interrupt and modify  user/control plane traffic traversing its premises on behalf of the MNO.  Abuse of lawful interception function: This threat relates to the abusive use of the lawful  interception function (based on the law) performed by a network operator/access  provider/service provider (NWO/AP/SvP), making available certain information to a law  enforcement monitoring facility. This threat also considers the unauthorised access to this  function when hosted outside the operator’s network. If a vendor/supplier has access to the  mobile network then it will be possible for him to manipulate this function and bypass the audit  mechanisms in a way that the abuse is not detected by the MNO.  Application programming interface (API) exploitation: This threat involves exploiting  application programming interfaces (APIs) to launch different types of attacks. Much of the  openness and programmability offered by the new 5G network architecture relies on the  expanded use of APIs. The exploitation can target different types of API naming internal  network functions, internetworking interfaces, roaming interfaces, etc. exposed in different  layers of the network. A poorly designed or configured API with inaccurate access control rules  may expose core network functions and sensitive parameters. It is important to highlight that 5G  infrastructure will rely on COTS solutions that extensively use open source APIs. The level of  quality and scrutiny imposed in the development and implementation of proprietary solutions  should also apply for COTS and open source components. The threat of having one small  compromised API in the 5G core may place the entire network at risk.  Exploitation of poorly designed architecture and planning (network, services and  security): Classified as unintentional damage - Inadequate design, planning or improper  adaptation – this threat relates to issues arising from the multiple options and features that this  technology has to offer from its original inception to implementation. The level of complexity and  the difficulty to reach an optimal architecture, adequate security and operating procedures may  lead to poor design and implementation. Design flaws are opportunities for malicious actors to  exploit. By knowing that a particular feature that is not adequately implemented or protected, a  malicious actor can exploit the breach and inject malware in the core network.  Exploitation of misconfigured or poorly configured systems/networks: Often identified as  a vulnerability, it’s the exploitation of misconfigured or poorly configured systems that qualifies  as a threat. The exploitation of a misconfigured system that in essence is from an unintentional  nature, creates the opportunity for a threat actor to reach critical assets in the network or stage  an attack. Configuration flaws may happen at different stages of the solution implementation  life-cycle such as product installation and maintenance. Examples include poorly configured  APIs, network functions, access control rules, network slices, administration rights, virtualised  environments, traffic isolation, edge nodes, orchestration software, firewalls, etc. It is worth  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  57  stating that this threat has consistently been a major cause of incidents reported to ENISA in the  Article 13a security breach notification process52.  Erroneous use or administration of the network, systems and devices: Classified as  unintentional damage (erroneous administration of devices and systems) the errors resulting  from a poorly maintained and administrated network may compromise the confidentially,  integrity and availability of the network. An example of actions associated with a poorly  administered system includes the lack of operational processes and procedures that could  expose the network to an attack.  Fraud scenarios related to roaming interconnections: In a roaming scenario, the visited  network needs to obtain authentication vectors from user’s home network, that could abusively  authenticate the user thus giving him access to serving MNO resources.53  Lateral movement: Classified as nefarious activity/abuse of assets, lateral movement is often  adopted by threat agents to gain position in different components of the core network. Once a  threat actor gains position, obtains enough time to perform reconnaissance activities to find  weaknesses in the network. The threat of lateral movement is of a great concern due to the  complex nature of and diversity of technologies used in a 5G Network. This fact allows threat  actor to operate undetected for longer periods and fine-tune an attack.  Memory scraping: This threat arises when an attacker scans the physical memory of a  software component in order to extract sensitive information that it is not authorised to have.  While memory scraping can affect components of any layer of the network, this type of threat  has been primarily identified for SDN application servers. While memory scraping threat may  target different components of the core network, a core dump of an SDN controller (e.g. as the  result of malicious software) can be used to exploit private data. Furthermore, SDN  reconfiguration may require reboots that an attacker could use in order to attack the boot  procedure. Once successfully performed, memory scraping can be used to extract sensitive  SDN data (e.g. flow rules at the northbound API).  Manipulation of network traffic, network reconnaissance and information gathering: The  threat includes the modification or falsification of data in transit (messages), injection of  illegitimate data into the network, whether by replaying previous messages or by forging new  messages, the use of traffic spikes and rerouting, modification of flow priorities.  Manipulation of network configuration data: Inadequate policies in the management and  protection of critical configuration data may lead to unpredictable system behaviour and  unauthorised access to critical platforms, with impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the  network. This threat involves compromising a core network element (e.g. SDN controller,  network function, management and orchestration function) by forging configuration data to  launch other attacks (e.g. DoS). While configuration data forging may, in principle, relate to data  held by any component of the network, this threat refers specifically to configuration and/or  control plane data. Examples of configuration data manipulation are listed below.   Routing tables manipulation   Falsification of configuration data   DNS manipulation  Malicious flooding of core network components: This threat involves flooding a network  component with requests or traffic, compromising its availability. Flooding may occur during the  52 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos, accessed September 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  58  transmission of data, exhausting component resources and leading to a reduction or complete  shutdown of the service provided by the component. This threat also considers other techniques  such as amplification and saturation described below.  Amplification and flooding attacks take place in specific SDN components whereby a small  stream of requests from a faked sender elicits a massive flood of responses. While protection  from such attacks has been devised for many known network protocols, the exposure of several  network functions (NFV) by SDN controllers presents a completely new landscape of threats.  Flooding attacks may come in the flavour of distributed DoS attacks, where a vast number of  sources may be orchestrated to generate the message floods. These sources could, for  example, be the members of a botnet, e.g. a collection of devices infected with malware to the  point that they can all be controlled by an attacker to execute the attack. Flooding attacks may  affect all kinds of external interfaces the network provides, including the radio interface,  interfaces to external networks like the internet or other mobile networks.  Malicious diversion of traffic: This threat involves compromising a network element to divert  traffic flows and allow a malicious actor to eavesdrop on network traffic. Traffic diversion is a  threat relating to network elements of the data plane. A specific kind of traffic diversion that is  available in virtualised networks is the network slice trespassing. This threat may occur when  the mandatory isolation between slices is compromised in any active node or when the  enforcing access to a slice in the edge equipment is either bypassed or misconfigured.  Manipulation of the network resources orchestrator: The threat considers the manipulation  of the network resources orchestrator configuration to perform an attack. This threat includes  modifying a network function behaviour by altering the settings in the orchestrator (E2E service  inventory, service programmability) and consequently compromising the separation between  network functions.  Misuse of audit tools: This threat is classified under nefarious activities/abuse of assets. Audit  tools are used by MNOs to monitor the activity of the network and obtain information that can be  used for multiple purposes such as optimisation, security, commercial, etc. This type of software  tools retain information about the network and its users and provide an advantage to malicious  actors to perform recognisance activities for an attack. A malicious actor typically uses insiders  to the MNO with privileged access to these tools to extract sensitive information.  Opportunistic and fraudulent usages of shared resources. This threat relates to  unauthorised access and/or modification of 5G connected devices critical data. End-to-end keys  may be stolen or leaked from the centralized key servers. As a consequence, the end-to-end  secured communication is vulnerable for different attacks and adversaries gain an access to the  end-points. The root cause is the leaking of authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)  credentials from the MNO’s employee network.53  Registration of malicious network functions. This threat is classified as nefarious activities or  abuse of assets (NAA). An unauthorised network function (NF) or function embedding a Trojan,  - introduced in the network by an insider (to the MNO) or a vendor/service provider - could be  abusively installed in the service base architecture (SBA) and registered in the core network via  NRF, in order to expose other malicious APIs. By having an unauthorized network function  installed or activated, a malicious actor may have access to sensitive assets in the network to  53 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/5G-PPP_White-Paper_Phase-1-Security-Landscape_June-2017.pdf,  accessed September 2019  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/5G-PPP_White-Paper_Phase-1-Security-Landscape_June-2017.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  59  perform other type of attacks such as DoS, distribution of malicious software, stealing sensitive  information, etc.  Traffic sniffing: Sniffing is a popular method used by malicious actors to capture and analyse  network communication information. With sniffing, a malicious actor is also able to eavesdrop  data from network elements or links and steal valuable information. Sniffing can happen  anywhere where there is constant traffic. In SDN for example, a malicious actor can take  advantage of unencrypted communications to intercept traffic from and to a central controller.  The data captured could include critical information on flows or traffic allowed on the network.  Side-channel attacks: This threat involves extracting information on existing flow rules used by  network elements. The threat can be realised by exploiting patterns of network operations (e.g.  exploiting the time required for establishing a network connection). Side-channel attacks are a  threat relating to network elements of the data plane.  5.3 ACCESS NETWORK THREATS  Abuse of spectrum resources: The illegal use of these resources, due to the dynamic  allocation/ reallocation of the same, may allow the occupation of specific idle spectrum band by  imitating the characteristics of a legitimately licensed unit and causing interference in radio  frequencies. This illicit occupation of the spectrum may also induce a network node to reject  spectrum resources requested by unlicensed units - due to the apparent lack of idle resources –  thus blocking someone out of the core network.  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning: This kind of attack is also called ARP cache  spoofing: a technique by which an attacker sends spoofed ARP messages onto the network.  Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another  host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the  attacker instead.  Fake access network node: Classified as a nefarious activity, this threat considers the  compromise of a base station (gnB) by masquerading as legitimate, facilitating different types of  attacks such as man-in-the-middle or network traffic manipulation. The threat considers  tampering the communication between the mobile user equipment (UE) and the network to  initiate other malicious actions.  Flooding attack: This threat involves flooding radio interfaces with requests. Flooding occurs  through the transmission of data that can exhaust component resources and lead to a reduction  or complete shutdown of the radio frequency provided by the component.  IMSI catching attacks: This threat relates to cellular paging protocols that can be exploited by  a malicious actor in the vicinity of a victim to associate the victim's soft-identity (e.g., phone  number, Twitter handle) with its paging occasion. Through an attack dubbed  ‘$mathsf{ToRPEDO}$’  a malicious actor can verify a victim's coarse-grained location  information, inject fabricated paging messages, and mount denial-of-service attacks.  Jamming the radio frequency: Classified as a nefarious activity/abuse of asset, this threat  refers to an intentional disruption/interference of the network radio frequency (NRF) causing the  core network (and related services) to become unreachable for affected users. The threat also  refers to the unavailability of the transport layer when using radio-based networks and  interference with the geo-positioning system (GPS).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  60  MAC spoofing: MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access  Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The MAC address that is  hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed. However, many drivers  allow the MAC address to be changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an  operating system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing. The process  of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing. Essentially, MAC spoofing entails  changing a computer's identity to conduct an attack.  Manipulation of access network configuration data: This threat involves compromising an  access network element (e.g. base stations) to forge configuration data and launch other  attacks (e.g. DoS).  Radio interference: A threat in which the perpetrator seeks to make a network resource  unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely interfering or disrupting the Radio  Access Network service. The introduction of compromised 5G devices in a radio access  network will present a more substantial DoS threat.  Radio traffic manipulation: This threat considers the manipulation of network traffic at the  base station level. A man-in-the-middle attack can be launched based on a rogue base station  when malicious actor masquerades its Base Transceiver Station (BTS) as a real network’s BTS.  This threat is still considered valid due to backwards compatibility to previous generations of  mobile technology. Other associated threats follow:   Traffic redirecting  Session hijacking: This threat is classified as nefarious activity or abuse of asset and relates  to attacks to open-air interfaces. The threat considers the theft of legitimate authenticated  conversation session ID by a malicious actor, to control the whole session of specific traffic to  conduct other types of attacks.  Signalling fraud: One of the areas of concern is the international signalling interconnection  between networks which may be misused for fraud (e.g., false charging). Another example is  the threat of greedy mobile nodes that transmit fake incumbent signals and force all other users  to vacate a specific band (spectrum hole) to acquire its exclusive use.  Signalling storms: Mobile networks are subject to ‘signalling storms’ launched by malware or  apps, which overload the bandwidth at the cell, the backbone signalling servers, and Cloud  servers, and may also deplete the battery power of mobile devices. Signalling storms will be  more challenging due to the excessive connectivity of UEs, small base stations, and high user  mobility.  5.4 MULTI EDGE COMPUTING THREATS  False or rogue MEC gateway: The open nature of edge gateways, where even user-owned  devices can become full-fledged participants (e.g. personal cloudlets, TV smart-box, etc.),  creates a scenario where malicious actors can deploy their own gateway devices. This  particular threat produces the same outcome as the Man-in-the-Middle attack.  Edge node overload. This threat relates to attacks against edge networks disrupting the vicinity  of the affected networks, at a local or service-specific level. The overload may take place by  flooding the edge node with request or traffic directed to this component, initiated by a specific  mobile app or IoT device.  Abuse of edge open application programming interfaces (APIs): The abuse of open APIs in  Multi Edge Computing nodes is done through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in MEC type of  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  61  applications. The need for open APIs in MEC is mainly to provide support for federated services  and interactions with different providers and content creators. This threat can be associated with  DoS, man-in-the-middle, malicious mode problems, privacy leakages, and VM manipulation.  5.5 VIRTUALISATION THREATS  Abuse on Data Centers Interconnect (DCI) protocol: Virtualised systems are deployed within  data centers, hence, security threats of Data Centers should be considered. This threat relates  to the exploitation of specific vulnerabilities of Data Centers Interconnect (DCI) protocols (e.g.  lack of authentication and encryption). An attacker could create spoofed traffic in such a way  that it traverses DCI links or to create a DoS attack of DCI connections.  Abuse of cloud computational resources: The abuse of powerful computing infrastructure,  including both software and hardware components, could be easily achieved using a simple  registration process in a cloud computing service provider. By taking advantage of the prevailing  computing power of cloud networks, hackers can fire attacks in a very short time. For example,  brute force attacks and DoS attacks can be launched by abusing the power of cloud computing.  Network virtualisation bypassing: Issues related to bad network slicing implementation and  configuration or improper isolation can cause loss of data confidentiality/privacy (Data/traffic  intercepted by entities of other slices). A network used by different tenants needs to assure that  only legitimate traffic enters or leaves a network slice, but also that any switching element  checks and enforces the traffic isolation by installing legitimate flow rules preventing slice  trespassing. At core network level, the hostile actor would exploit hypervisor vulnerabilities and  flow rules configuration to trespass slice isolation and disclose data belonging to other tenants.  Virtualised host abuse: This threat relates to applications running on virtualised hosts, abusing  from shared resources from a virtualised environment. In virtual environments, where physical  resources are shared between tenants, there may be a set of behaviours that result in the  disclosure of sensitive information. For instance, exposure via scavenging in virtualised  environments is even more serious than in physical systems. While interception is a common  threat in physical systems (e.g., networking environments), its effect is further exacerbated in  virtual environments because it permits cross-inspection of various tenant’s data flow, as well as  topology inference that could serve to set up a DoS attack.  5.6 PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THREATS  Manipulation of hardware equipment: This threat considers the inclusion of concealed  hardware or software in the product by a vendor or supplier. This threat may occur at an initial  stage of the product implementation or during maintenance with the application of uncontrolled  updates and new features.  Natural disasters affecting the network infrastructure: Classified as natural or  environmental disaster, this threat refers to natural events such as fires, floods and earthquakes  that can affect 5G network equipment and therefore, the availability of the service at a local and  regional level. Specific types of assets are more exposed to natural disasters such as radio  access equipment (e.g. base stations) and network transport due to its installation on an  outdoor environment.  Physical sabotage/vandalism of the network infrastructure: Classified as a deliberate  physical attack, this threat relates to actions taken by actors aimed at destroying, disabling or  stealing physical assets supporting the 5G Network. A physical attack to 5G critical assets may  disrupt, interfere and ultimately cause unavailability of the network service. Despite the  existence of physical protection mechanisms (e.g., physical surveillance and surveillance  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  62  cameras, security locks, security guards), physical breaches and insider threat attacks may still  occur.  Threat from third parties’ personnel accessing MNO’s facilities. This threat consider the  physical access to facilities and network physical infrastructure by third-party personnel, to  perform maintenance activities and provide technical support. Hostile and untrustworthy  operators could affect the security requirements of the network.  UICC format exploitation. New UICC formats could lead to new kind of vulnerabilities that may  be exploited for data exfiltration, fraud or DoS purposes. Different types of new UICC  components (like eUICC, iUICC, soft SIM, etc.) require new management protocols for the  provisioning of user-profiles and their life cycle. These protocols can be exploited to create DoS  toward the user or for fraud scenarios, including user impersonification.  User equipment compromising: New formats of user equipment, including low-cost insecure  IoT devices, could introduce new kind of vulnerabilities, which may be exploited to target user  data confidentiality and integrity. Abuses on hardware and software implementation on UE side  to install malicious components may compromise confidentiality and integrity of subscriber  profile data.  5.7 GENERIC THREATS  Denial of Service (DoS): DoS is a threat categorised under Nefarious Activity and Abuse of  Asset (NAA), in which the perpetrator seeks to make a network resource unavailable to its  intended users by temporarily or indefinitely interfering or disrupting the network service. The  attack comprises the generation of a massive number of requests or with traffic in a way that the  network becomes partly or completely unavailable for regular users. Multiple types of threats  may lead to a denial of service such as flooding, amplification, signalling storm and saturation  attacks. An attack combining multiple vectors may lead to a distributed DoS (DDoS) attack.  Data breach, leak, theft destruction and manipulation of information: This includes, but not  limited to, the theft of personal information through unauthorised access to the systems and/or  network, unauthorised access to and possible publication of personal identifiable  information/biometric/medical (privacy breach), company confidential information (intellectual  property, commercial and financial data) or government/state-related information (classified  information). The theft, breach or leak of other types of data such as user credentials,  encryption keys, network security logs, software configuration, etc. may also help malicious  actor conducting different types of attacks.  Eavesdropping: Classified as Nefarious Activity and Abuse of Asset (NAA), eavesdropping is a  threat in which the perpetrator seeks to tamper the application and communication layers from  the various 5G network elements (SDN controller, network function, edge node, virtualisation  orchestrator). It includes the eavesdropping on subscriber’ data, confidential information, system  time, subscriber location, electronic messages, signal of data relayed over the network. The  threat actor monitors, spies and/or eavesdrop Nation-State citizens and/or organisations to track  the location or access sensitive information.  Exploitation of software and hardware vulnerabilities: This type of threat enables a  malicious actor to take advantage of unknown (to the vendor and user) or unpatched software  or hardware flaws to perform an attack. Example include the exploitation of known hardware  and software flaws such as meltdown, spectre and buffer overflow. It also includes the  exploitation of other known vulnerabilities related to previous generations of mobile  telecommunications and older signalling protocols such as SS7 (Signalling System 7) and  Diameter.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  63  Malicious code or software: The threat includes the installation and distribution of malicious  software or the implant of specific code or software inside a product or updates. Examples of  malicious software include malware, ransomware, virus, worms, trojans, SQL injections, rogue  security software, rogueware and careware. An example of a malicious software in the 5G  context considers the use of an unauthorised VNF that could abusively install and register itself  into the core network in order to expose malicious APIs.  Compromised supply chain, vendor and service providers: This threat considers the  intentional insertion by a vendor into the product of concealed hardware, malicious software and  software flaws. It also considers the implementation of uncontrolled software updates,  manipulation of functionalities, inclusion of functions to bypass audit mechanisms, backdoors,  undocumented testing features left in the production version, among others.  This threat also relates to activities performed by untrustworthy third parties’ personnel during  product testing, maintenance, configuration and operation. Third parties’ personnel have access  to the network management facilities (both locally and via remote interface) in order to perform  maintenance activities and provide technical support. This privileged access to the operation,  administration and management (OAM) of the network provides an advantage to untrustworthy  third parties’ personnel to access various type of data such as (subscriber’s, system and  network configuration, telemetry data).  Targeted threats: Highly sophisticated attacks or advanced persistence threats may target  sensitive information, e.g. state secrets, industrial secrets or intellectual property, or the  availability of sensitive and critical services.  Exploiting flaws in security, management and operational procedures: Not directly  related with 5G, this threat will become relevant when dealing with the complexity of the  technology and the need to introduce operational procedures to the management of the  Network. This threat includes, but not limited to, the exploitation of flaws in the operational and  security management of the network; configuration, update and patch management of the  software. The errors from the lack or poorly design operational and security procedures may  have consequences to the integrity and availability of the network.  Abuse of authentication: This threat may affect multiple network entry points such as user  equipment (mobile devices and IoT), operation and management interfaces, roaming and  vertical services. This threat includes the theft of user credentials, brute force of user accounts,  password cracking, masking the user identity and impairment of an IoT grouping authentication  as techniques used by threat actors to abuse the 5G authentication systems.  Identity theft or spoofing: This threat may materialise when a malicious actor successfully  determines the identity of a legitimate entity and then masquerades to launch further attacks.  Identity spoofing is a threat that can affect any software component or human agent. In this  attack, the attacker spoofs the identity of a legitimate controller and interacts with the network  functions controlled by the legitimate controller (i.e. elements of the data plane) to trigger  several other types of attacks (instigate network flows, divert traffic, etc.). The use of social  engineering, brute force user account/password cracking may also be used as a technique to  spoof or steal user credentials.

THREAT AGENTS  In the next generation of Mobile Networks (5G), it is expected that the existing threat agent  profiles will develop towards a new set of capabilities and motives. This is due to the  overarching nature of the 5G Mobile Networks: they are going to play the role of ‘networks of  networks’, thus completely changing the use of the Internet and similarly, interconnecting  numerous verticals that until now have been operating in isolation. Due to their nature, 5G  networks will deliver multiple added-value and critical services and functions to the economy  and society. This will attract the attention of existing and new threat agent groups with a large  variety of motives.  Given this complexity, it is expected that the following facts are going to change the attacker  profile:   A whole set of new vulnerabilities will expand the attack surface, exposure and number  of critical assets.   New tools/methods to exploit those vulnerabilities will be developed.   New motives/ impacted targets are going to be observed due to the interconnected  verticals/applications.   Existing threat agent groups may be expanded with ones that have an interest in novel  malicious objectives.  These facts may cause an unprecedented shift of capabilities and objectives of existing threat  agent groups in ways that have not been seen in the past. The description of threat agent  groups takes all these considerations into account at a theoretical level. This is because the 5th  generation of mobile networks is not yet fully rolled-out and is currently in the pilot phase.  In the following descriptions, the threat agent groups introduced from ENISA Threat Landscape  201854 (ETL2018) are going to be used, extrapolated to the new facts potentially affecting  attacker’s profiles. Because of the latter, the new threat-agent group cyber-warriors will be  added to the existing groups. This is due to the fact that 5G Mobile Networks are going to  comprise a significant target for military operations, but also as a platform used for military  purposes, as already mentioned in some sources55,56.  ELT2018 categorizes thread agents as follows:   Cyber criminals   Insider (own, third parties)   Nation states   Hacktivists   Cyber-fighters   Cyber-terrorists   Corporations   Script kiddies  54 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018, accessed September 2019.  55 https://finabel.org/5g-implications-on-the-battlefield/, accessed September 2019.  56 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5g-weapon-should-we-scared-dr-michelle-dickinson-mnzm-/, accessed September 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018 https://finabel.org/5g-implications-on-the-battlefield/ https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5g-weapon-should-we-scared-dr-michelle-dickinson-mnzm-/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  72  Another nuance that will be important in the development of threat agent profiles is the ability to  have legitimate access to the network: while legitimate internal and external employees are  covered through the agent group ‘Employees’, one needs to take into account that almost all of  the above mentioned external threat agents may have legitimate access to the network. This  will take the hurdle of access to the attacked system(s), facilitating thus their malicious  purposes.  Having said all the above, a short description of the 5G threat agent groups is as follows:  Cyber-criminals: Given the vast presence of this threat agent group in cyber-space and the  advanced capabilities that they continue maintaining, it is likely that this threat agent group will  keep its presence w.r.t. 5G Mobile networks. Given the statistics of activities of this threat agent  group,57 it looks like their attacks targeting multiple industries and governments may be  channelled to the emerging 5G Mobile Networks.58 Though not yet representing a significant  monetizing vector, such attacks (or preparations hereto), will be part of their activities.59 The  anticipated number of vulnerabilities, the complexity and low level of maturity of the 5G network  are indicative for this shift.60 Legitimate access of cyber-criminals to the 5G network may  exacerbate the threats posed by this group.  Insiders: Insiders are assumed to be a vital threat agent group in the 5G landscape mainly  because these are MNOs employees, in constant proximity with the core of the technology  representing a vast number of individuals. Other reasons substantiate the importance of this  group naming the complexity of the network and a large number of stakeholders engaged in its  use and operation. While the skill issue and increased complexity will surge the amount of  unintentional damages significantly, dishonest insiders and 3rd party employees may misuse  their access to vital network function to cause high impact/large scale availability issues in the  network itself. Such incidents may have cascaded impact on interconnected industries/verticals.  Given the fact that disgruntled/dissatisfied insiders are a primary target for high capability  agents, they might be recruited to abuse their insider knowledge, e.g. through monetary  rewards. Finally, given the current race for 5G patents/IPS matters, it is expected that this threat  agent group will have an additional motive to increase their activities.  Nation States: This threat agent group is important due both to its ability to compromise future  5G Network and its potential motivation to do so. It is indisputable that vendors of 5G  components – just like any other technology vendor– are in a better position to cause  devastating attacks to the operation of self-developed components, especially when  governments influence them. Given the importance of 5G to the sovereignty of nation-states,  they will most probably be a target of state-sponsored attacks. Despite the numerous activities  to setup vendor requirements namely, to understand the misuse vectors of various components  and design the corresponding security controls, it will not prevent a nation state from attacking  another country 5G Network. According to recent statistics,57 attacks motivated by espionage  represent a significant number in the 2019 threat landscape.  Cyber warriors: Cyberwar is, according to incident statistics,57 the third most frequent motive  and a trend that will inevitably keep up w.r.t. the 5G ecosystem. For many reasons, it is worth to  say that 5G infrastructure will be one of the most vital components to protect in the technology  landscape. This is mainly due to the need to maintain dominance, independence and  57 https://www.hackmageddon.com/2019/08/12/june-2019-cyber-attacks-statistics/, accessed September 2019.  58 https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/telecom-crimes-against-the-iot-and-5g/, accessed September  2019.  59 https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/02/cybercrime-will-be-exacerbated-by-5g-mcafee-experts-say/, accessed  September 2019.  60 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49043822, accessed September 2019.  https://www.hackmageddon.com/2019/08/12/june-2019-cyber-attacks-statistics/ https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/telecom-crimes-against-the-iot-and-5g/ https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/02/cybercrime-will-be-exacerbated-by-5g-mcafee-experts-say/ https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49043822  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  73  sovereignty of a country, especially the ones in which a vicinity between vendors and  governments is being maintained (e.g. US, Europe, China). Moreover, there is evidence, that  the military sector will be interested in using 5G61,62, just as many security-related verticals (e.g.  critical infrastructures). Such a development will amplify the protection requirements and the  attractiveness of 5G as a target of cyberwar. Cyber warriors will maintain their presence in the  cyberthreat landscape with a focus on 5G in both roles of defender and offender, depending on  global geopolitical developments. It is expected that this is part of the agendas in the defence  sector, especially in those countries that strive for technological dominance and influence.  Hacktivists: Though this threat agent group has a presence in the cyberthreat landscape  (fourth position by means of number of incidents), it is not clear how it is going to be engaged in  5G malicious activities. While the most probable is to see this group engaging in regional  campaigns, it cannot be excluded that it could achieve high impact activities in national and  even global 5G infrastructures. Just as the efficiency of attacks of all other threat agent groups,  this will depend heavily on: a) the maturity of 5G rollouts w.r.t. cybersecurity protection  measures, b) the number of vulnerabilities of 5G components, c) the availability of 5G  exploits/malicious tools and modus operadi and d) the skill set available to master 5G  infrastructure complexity at the side of 5G stakeholders. Just as other threat agent groups,  hacktivist will be able to gain legitimate access to 5G network, hence attacking from inside the  network.  Corporations: Although this threat agent group has not enjoyed special attention in recent  ENISA Threat Landscapes, it is believed that its role will increase in future editions of the report.  The main reason lays in the intention to increase competitiveness and becoming part of the 5G  ecosystem. On the other hand, corporations will be interested in tracking the development of  patents and IPRs that are related to 5G infrastructure: given the emergence of 5G technology,  this area is going to attract the attention of this threat agent group mainly. Other reasons for  increased engagement are to trace the involvement of competitors to 5G procurements,  understand business opportunities related to 5G and strengthen their role in the market. Due to  the overarching nature of 5G, corporations from a large number of sectors/vertical will be  potentially attracted by 5G developments, increasing thus the number of entries into this threat  agent group.  Cyber-terrorists: There are multiple references to alleged interest from this threat group to  produce harm to 5G infrastructures.63,64 The main concern about future actions from this group  is the concentration of ‘values’ that will take place as a result of a 5G deployment. 5G is going  to (inter-) connect vast amounts of services that are vital to the society, governments and  business and this will thus attract the attention of cyber-terrorist groups. Through the integration  of multiple verticals, 5G will provide a single attack surface that once targeted, may result in  damages in the physical space (e.g. hybrid threats). Although incident statistics do not provide  evidence for significant activity of cyber-terrorists in the cyber-space, 5G stakeholder will need  to take the protection of this infrastructure very seriously to avoid high impact events that would  cause severe harm to society.65 This effort requires multifaceted/multilevel protection controls  involving coordinated activities of numerous stakeholders at a scale that had never existed  before 5G. This is a challenge that can be mastered, only if there is a concerted effort to protect  61 https://www.techradar.com/news/how-the-5g-network-could-benefit-the-military, accessed September 2019.  62 https://www.afcea.org/content/5g-warfighters, accessed September 2019.  63 https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/444251-5g-risk-is-about-more-than-simply-securing-competitive-advantage,  accessed September 2019.  64 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/uk-security-chief-warns-of-5g-terrorism-threat/,  accessed September 2019.  65 https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020354/while-weighing-5g-security-risks-france-predicts-it-can- manage, accessed September 2019.  https://www.techradar.com/news/how-the-5g-network-could-benefit-the-military https://www.afcea.org/content/5g-warfighters https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/444251-5g-risk-is-about-more-than-simply-securing-competitive-advantage https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/uk-security-chief-warns-of-5g-terrorism-threat/ https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020354/while-weighing-5g-security-risks-france-predicts-it-can-manage https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020354/while-weighing-5g-security-risks-france-predicts-it-can-manage  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  74  5G infrastructure and its importance goes beyond the threats posed by a single threat agent  group.  Script kiddies: The emerging technology landscape has many components that are in the  control of individual users. Examples are IoT devices, mobile phones, cloud and storage  spaces, social media platforms, etc. These components are the perfect playground for  technology-interested young individuals that have low motivation/low capabilities but are  equipped with malicious tools. In the past, we have seen high impact attacks (e.g. DDoS)  spreading from home devices and gadgets. With the availability of high-speed 5G networks and  interconnected devices, activities of this threat agent group may cause significant impact though  cascaded events affecting upstream components of 5G operators. Just as all other threat agent  groups, script-kiddies may possess legitimate access to the network and be able to use network  functions to manage their own devices, increasing thus the potential of misuse.

RECOMMENDATIONS/  CONCLUSIONS  7.1 RECOMMENDATIONS  Based on the assets, threats and the state-of-play of current developments, the following  recommendations/courses of actions can be made for various stakeholders of the 5G  ecosystem:  Recommended courses of action at EU level (e.g. Member States, European Commission,  ENISA):  Share existing 5G knowledge to stakeholder communities: Current technical material  should be disseminated at EU level. Consolidated results will enable evidence-based policy  actions. The content produced needs to be widely disseminated and settled as a basis for  guiding technical discussions and future iterations with all related stakeholder groups engaged  in policy-making.  Promote bridges between all stakeholders: Within the coming years, it will be important to  stimulate working relationships with all relevant 5G stakeholders with a focus on the material  that serves as a basis for future knowledge capturing and knowledge dissemination in the area  of 5G threat analysis. This needs to lead to an efficient network of experts in various domains  that will be responsible for contributing to the creation of 5G Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI). This  material plays a central role in the production of future risk assessments, thus creating the  conditions to compatible/coherent risk assessments.  Enable the necessary iterations to improve the current material on cyberthreats: Together  with the engaged stakeholders, there is a need to create planning content for future iterations of  threat/risk assessment work to be performed by various stakeholders at EU level. This plan will  allow for better coordination of work; it will enable an efficient mobilisation of resources and will  create a competitive advantage for EU 5G stakeholders. Coordination with the work of 5G  standardisation bodies will be of particular importance. Coordination with EU 5G initiatives  active in the security field will also be key to achieve since delivering.  Recommendations for 5G market stakeholders (e.g. vendors, MNOs, Operators of Serices,  Standardisation Bodies, etc.):  Engage in EU-wide discussions on 5G matters: Organisations engaging in the 5G market  (e.g. vendors, operators and verticals) hold a significant part of the knowledge on 5G, as they  roll out initial pilots/versions of 5G infrastructures. Their experience in technical, organisational  and business issues of a 5G deployment are of particular importance for the generation of  practical security guidance.  Contribute to the knowledge collection/dissemination: A basis for injecting non-competitive  information will need to be agreed and built up. For this purpose, trust models among the  participating organisations need to be established. The provision of human resources to take  care of this interaction will be necessary.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  76  Bring in knowledge on economic/investment/market penetration dimensions: Currently,  too less information on economic aspects and investment plans on 5G deployment are  available. This information is necessary to assess the economic capacity of market players and  understand/prioritise feasible steps for the implementation of security measures, perform gap  analysis and understand the impact of security incidents. It is proposed to collect this kind of  information that will help to create more targeted guidance on 5G cybersecurity implementation  plans.  Recommendations for national competent bodies in the area of 5G cybersecurity (e.g. NRAs,  NCSCs, National 5G Test Centres, etc.):  Disseminate existing 5G material: Competent bodies are an important link in the  dissemination of 5G material from and to the EU stakeholders. This dissemination will need to  be performed in a coordinated manner to achieve coherence with and the extension of the  developed knowledge base. Such coordination will need to be performed within all national and  EU groups engaging in 5G activities. It will be subject of plannable consolidation efforts to be  taken into account within EU-wide plans.  Inform about 5G activities held in the scope of their responsibilities: Competent bodies will  need to inform national and EU 5G stakeholders/partners about their activities. This will help to  create national and EU-wide coordination and to leverage EU activities on national efforts.  Produced information will be hooked-up to corresponding activities accordingly. This will  contribute to an efficient mobilization and usage of existing 5G efforts/resources.  Provide available expertise and human resources: Available 5G resources are  scarce/limited. The efficient use of those resources will be necessary to achieve maximum  efficiency and reduce duplicated efforts. This will be a decisive factor for the achievement of the  tasks on the 5G agenda and will increase the trust among participating experts.  While the above may be advisable future actions for various stakeholder groups, ENISA  envisages an involvement in the following actions:  Disseminate current details of assets and threat landscape to all kinds of stakeholders:  This action will enable the creation of a common terminology and a shared understanding of  threat exposure of valuable 5G assets. This information will facilitate future interactions and will  provide a solid basis for future – eventually more detailed – assessments, while enabling the  expansion of the material on an on-demand basis. It will be essential to create feedback loops  to keep this material updated so that it builds a comprehensive and solid EU-wide knowledge  base (see also establishment of hooks below).  Refine/amend existing material according to the pace of 5G developments: While 5G  specification and deployment activities progress within the related market, additional details are  added to the current threat assessment to: cover emerging specifications, follow-up on further  information from current market and policy developments.  Establish hooks to enrol and mobilise strategic stakeholders: The current level of 5G  stakeholder engagement needs to be increased. Vendors, MNOs and NRAs need to be more  actively integrated into the related work. Moreover, better coordination with EU bodies needs to  be settled (e.g. NIS Cooperation Group, EU DGs and Units) to inject existing knowledge to  Member States and EU-policy activities. This action will come to amplify the effects mentioned  in the above points (disseminating knowledge and gradual amending existing material).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  77  These proposals will need to be validated by Member States (NIS CG) and European  Commission. In this respect, ENISA may be tasked with technical work reflected in these  recommendations as deemed necessary.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  78  7.2 CONCLUSIONS  Concluding this first attempt towards the identification of 5G asset exposure to cyberthreats,  ENISA draws the attention of all relevant stakeholders to the above-identified  recommendations. It will be important to use this material in various stakeholder activities,  identify current and future developments and try to accommodate those in future versions of the  present report.  Such a development will speed up the adoption of security requirements and secure 5G  practices and will create competitive advantages within the entire EU space.  ENISA will continue engaging within cybersecurity activities of 5G. Coordination with EU-wide  activities will be key to the success of this attempt.  Future ENISA actions on this matter will be agreed upon, mandated and coordinated with  European Commission and Member States (NIS CG) as deemed necessary.  79  ANNEX A: ASSETS MAP (FULL)  5G  Assets

Expectations  grow with the broadband capabilities of 5G, accessible to everyone and everywhere at a better  quality and reliability. From a conceptual perspective, 5G technology promises to deliver low  latency, high speed and more reliable connections to new generations of autonomous systems  and edge-type devices, covering both massive and critical machine-type communications.  Furthermore, 5G technology is driven by use cases with a wide range of requirements. One of  the first commercial offers expected, is the Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) for dense urban  areas. Other use cases, such as the ones demanding dedicated coverage, vertical solutions  (i.e. connected vehicles), manufacturing, Industry 4.0, IIoT, energy, and healthcare, will come  at a later stage. Experts agree that verticals will be the main driving force in future  deployments of 5G Networks. These will play an essential role in investment strategies of  Mobile Network Operators MNOs.1  As networks and applications evolve further, there will be even more opportunities to enhance  existing use cases in addition to more verticals becoming part of the 5G infrastructure. As an  example, 5G will be highly beneficial for industrial use cases demanding higher data rates and  lower latency such as augmented reality (AR) and AI-based applications. Significant bandwidth  capabilities will assure the consistency of high-resolution images and video streaming, similarly  to sensor-rich environments with high connection density.  In the realm of this transition, the industry forecasted 1.5 billion users subscribed to a 5G  network and coverage to reach over 40 percent of the world's population by 2024.2 According to  the European 5G Observatory, citizens should have 5G access by 2020.3 In terms of  geographical coverage, 5G is expected to be deployed first in dense urban areas and later, in  less populated sub-urban and rural areas.  Mobile communication systems have been prone to security vulnerabilities from their very  inception. In the first generation (1G) of mobile networks, mobile phones and wireless channels  became a target for illegal cloning and masquerading. In the second generation (2G), message  spamming became common, not only for pervasive attacks but also for injecting false  information or broadcasting unwanted marketing information. In the third generation (3G), IP-  based communication enabled the migration of Internet security vulnerabilities and threats into  the wireless domain. With a growing demand for IP based communications, the fourth  generation (4G) enabled the proliferation of smart devices, multimedia traffic, and new services  into the mobile domain. This development led to a more complex and dynamic threat  landscape4,5.  With the advent of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks, security threat vectors will  expand, in particular with the exposure of new connected industries (Industry4.0) and critical  services (connected vehicular, smart cities etc.). The 3G revolution, introducing internet  1 https://nis-summer-school.enisa.europa.eu/#program, accessed September 2019.  2 https://www.ericsson.com/assets/local/mobility-report/documents/2019/ericsson-mobility-report-world-economic-forum.pdf,  accessed September 2019.  3 http://5gobservatory.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/80082-5G-Observatory-Quarterly-report-2-V2.pdf, accessed  September 2019.  4 http://www.webtorials.com/main/resource/papers/lucent/paper94/MobileNetworkThreats.pdf, accessed September 2019.  5 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7547270, accessed Spetember 2019.

The integration with and exposure to the data network, is even more  prevalent across the 5G network.  The growing concerns over availability and protection of user data and privacy will exacerbate  with the security challenges introduced 5G. Hence, the most critical challenges relate to the  resilience of the network and the protection of content and metadata of 5G communications.  This report draws an initial threat landscape and presents an overview of the challenges in the  security of 5G networks. Its added value lays with the creation of a comprehensive 5G  architecture, the identification of important assets (asset diagram), the assessment of threats  affecting 5G (threat taxonomy), the identification of asset exposure (threats – assets mapping)  and an initial assessment of threat agent motives.  The content of this Threat Landscape is fully aligned with the EU-Wide Coordinated Risk  Assessment of 5G networks security.6 The EU-wide Coordinated Risk Assessment, published  on the 9th of October 2019 by the European Commission, which built on the methodological  approach developed for the threat landscape, presents in Section 2(D) ten high-level risk  scenarios based on the information provided by Member States within National Risk  Assessments.  The ENISA 5G Threat Landscape leverages from and complements this information by  providing a more detailed technical view on the 5G architecture, sensitive assets, cyberthreats  affecting the assets and threat agents. The information produced for this Threat Landscape is  based on publicly available information published by 5G standardisation groups and bodies (i.e.  ETSI, 3GPP, 5GPPP) and 5G stakeholders such as operators, vendors, national and  international organisations. An expert group with experts from mobile operators, vendors,  research and European Commission has contributed to ENISA’s work with information on  existing 5G material, current developments in the market and research and quality assurance of  the current document. Moreover, the members of the NIS CG, European Commission and  ENISA have reviewed the current document.  In particular, the content of this Threat Landscape includes:   A detailed architecture, outlining the most important/critical 5G infrastructure  components, through nine detailed ‘Zoom-ins’ of 5G architectural elements mentioned  in section 2 (B) of the Coordinated Risk Assessment. Examples of these elements  include the core network functions (NFV), management and network orchestration  (MANO), radio access network (RAN), and others;   A detailed threat assessment on 5G infrastructure components considering the  identified sensitive assets. The assessed threats refine/extend the ones presented in  section 2 (A) of the Coordinated Risk Assessment. A mapping provided in the annexes  show the relationships of the both reports (see Annex C, a mapping between ten risk  scenarios and assessed threats);   An initial assessment of the motives and capabilities of threat agents concerning 5G  assets, extending the information provided in section 2 (A) of the Coordinated Risk  Assessment;  6 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security, accessed  October 2019.

INTRODUCTION  The ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks report delivers some of the most relevant  aspects related to the type, origin and objectives of cybersecurity threats targeting this new  generation of mobile networks. To better understand these threats, it is essential to know what  is at stake and what can be compromised. This report represents a first attempt to identify the  most critical components (assets) in a 5G Network, which may become a target to various  cybersecurity threats. The task of assessing threats has posed multiple challenges: the overall  5G Infrastructure is a very complex ecosystem in which legacy and contemporary mainstream  technologies converge. The production of a comprehensive 5G architecture covering all  essential elements/functions constitutes another challenging task. The creation of a coherent  and comprehensive architecture employing elements from existing generic 5G architectures  requires an alignment with existing and ongoing work produced by standardisation bodies and  other relevant entities (e.g. 3GPP, 5GPPP, ITU, ETSI and GSMA). The comprehensive 5G  architecture presented in this report is further detailed in various ‘Zoom-ins’, providing more  information on the most sensitive 5G components.  Another challenge is to identify the threat exposure to specific 5G assets, which are still in an  early specification stage within the technology industry, Service Providers and Mobile Network  Operators (MNO). Moreover, given that 5G Networks are currently in a pilot phase, the lack of  known incidents and information about weaknesses makes the analysis of threat exposure even  more challenging. This fact forced us to identify possible 5G cyberthreats by assessing the  threat exposure on various subsystems based on previous experience. By analysing existing  material - including EU-Wide Coordinated Risk Assessment of 5G networks security -we also  collected theoretical cyberthreats identified by analogy to existing mobile networks. For similar  reasons, it has been challenging to find relevant information on threat agents targeting 5G  components. Hence, the discussion on threat agents is based on the assumption that various  motives may justify an attack. Finally, some bibliographical references used as a baseline for  this report are still considered as ‘work in progress’ by the authors (standardisation bodies,  vendors, operators, regulators and policymakers). This makes the information collection process  even more difficult as it brings ‘white spots’ for some content that is potentially relevant for the  analysis of threats (e.g. vulnerabilities, mitigation controls, implementation guidelines, etc.).  For all the reasons mentioned above, it is worth noticing that this first attempt to analyse 5G  threats and assets will need to be extended. It will require regular updates to increase the level  of detail, completeness and inclusion of new developments. ENISA may further elaborate this  assessment to include more details both at the levels of the 5G infrastructure and the relevant  cyberthreats, when requested and on-demand from stakeholders (e.g. European Commission  and Member States – NIS Cooperation Group).  For the time being, this report aims at supporting various stakeholders understanding the  relevant cyberthreats and the asset exposure within the 5G ecosystem. When requested,  ENISA is in a position to support stakeholders ‘drilling down’ the analysis further, by including  granular details from the components in focus and examine the relevance of the assessed  cyberthreats.  To better  understand the  cyberthreats  affecting 5G  Networks, it is  essential to know  the most critical  assets that may  be targeted by  malicious actors  and the threat  exposure of  these assets.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  10  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  The present report was prepared following the European Commission Recommendation (EU)  2019/534 of 26 March 2019 Cybersecurity on 5G networks,7 requesting the Member States to  carry out a risk assessment of the 5G network infrastructure. In this recommendation, the  European Commission requested ENISA to provide support to the Member States in this  exercise by preparing a threat landscape reviewing the most critical aspects of the technology.  Moreover, in the new ENISA regulation, the need to analyse current and emerging risks is  expressed. In line with this role, ENISA regulation stipulates that: “the Agency should, in  cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collect  relevant information.” 8 More specifically, it is stated that it should “enable effective responses to  current and emerging network and information security risks and threats.” 9  Therefore, the ENISA 5G Threat Landscape aims at contributing to the EU Cybersecurity  Strategy and more specifically, to ongoing policy initiatives related with the security of networks  and information systems; it streamlines and consolidates available information on cyberthreats  and their evolution.  1.2 SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY  The overarching nature of 5G, its complexity, the lack of information on existing deployments,  the width and depth of existing specifications and the large number of potential stakeholders  involved, makes the assessment of cyberthreats a difficult task. Being aware of this challenge,  the European Commission issued a recommendation urging EU Member States to assess the  risks and requesting ENISA to outline the corresponding cyberthreats.10 This report is the main  deliverable of this activity. This assessment was not the first attempt for ENISA to describe the  landscape. In 2016, ENISA published a Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for  Software Defined Networks/5G.11  The objectives, working modalities, method and scope set for this report are as follows:   The main objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview of the 5G  architecture while describing the decomposition of its sensitive assets, structured in  accordance with the level of exposure to various cyberthreats. This 5G architecture  provides a better overview of the supporting infrastructure and its main components  and facilitates the identification of sensitive assets.   To reduce the amount of material presented in this report, the focus was put on the  RAN and CORE components, leaving out any interconnected services, APIs,  application components and various sectors/verticals (e.g. Transportation, eHealth,  Industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT), Smart Environments, etc.).   To keep the related material to a manageable size, not every detail from 5G  specifications were included in this report. Instead, we considered the various relevant  network functions, virtualisation functions, radio access network, network management  functions and data household of the relevant components.

These may be included at a later stage in an on-demand basis.   Technical vulnerabilities were intentionally left out of scope to reduce complexity and to  optimise available resources. We plan to assess and analyse technical vulnerabilities  in detail in future versions of this report.   This report does not prescribe any mitigation measures/security controls to reduce the  5G Network exposure. This is ongoing work of various committees. Another reason is  the high complexity of 5G infrastructures and the low number of implementations: while  some mitigation measures are mentioned in specifications, there are still no good  practices in the protection of 5G Infrastructures. A significant amount of work will be  required - including the extrapolation of good practices of existing mobile  communication - to define security controls needed to protect 5G infrastructures. This  work may be performed in future iterations of the 5G threat analysis by taking into  account the results of ongoing initiatives (research projects, standardisation work, etc.).   The scope of this report is in line with previous work developed by ENISA, in particular,  the Threat Landscape for Software-Defined Networks/5G.12   This threat landscape complements the information provided in the EU Consolidated  Risk Assessment by providing an in-depth analysis of assets and threats, without  exposing any confidential information. This principle has been followed during the  decomposition of 5G assets and the preparation of the cyberthreat taxonomy. This  approach will help future on-demand risk assessments using the present threat  landscape (e.g. further focusing the scope in various asset categories, threat types,  etc.).   The report does not contain any content related to current 5G deployment strategies of  vendors and MNOs. Instead, it reflects the state-of-play in 5G  specification/development work (e.g. 5G-PPP), rather than current 5G  deployments/migration paths. It is planned to review this scope in future versions of the  threat landscape, pursuing the engagement of stakeholders involved in 5G  implementations.   The development of this report followed a ‘best-effort’ approach. The collected  information is not exhaustive but representative of the matters covered.   To collect relevant technical knowledge, ENISA has set up an expert group consisting  of individuals that are involved in 5G activities from vendors, operators,  research/academia and European Commission. The selection has been made based  on professional merits of the selected individuals (i.e. ad personam), while at the same  time trying to cover the skills from the most representative stakeholder types that are  currently engaged in 5G activities.   The content of this report was restricted to components/matters found in relevant open-  source material covering the entire specification, security requirements and research  results related to 5G network functions (NFs).  The method adopted for this study is in line with the methodology developed by ENISA for the  preparation of its annual Cyberthreat Landscape. According to this methodology, the process  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape, accessed September 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  12  requires an initial identification of critical assets within the architecture before performing a  threat assessment, which evaluates the different levels of asset exposure.  The elements of cyberthreats and the relationship to risks are graphically depicted inError!  Reference source not found.. The report describes the different relationships between assets,  threats and threat agents. In future versions of this report, we will cover vulnerabilities and  countermeasures (mitigation measures/security controls).  Figure 1: Methodology adopted based on ISO 27005  Threats play a central role in a risk assessment, especially when considering the different  components of risks. The ISO 27005, a widely adopted risk management standard, defines that  risks emerge when: “Threats abuse vulnerabilities of assets to generate harm for the  organisation”.13  Following this methodology, we have identified assets, threats and threat agents. These  constitute the core of the 5G Threat Landscape presented in this report. Furthermore, the  identification and analysis of assets and cyberthreats are based on the study of specifications,  white papers and literature, without attempting any interpretation/evaluation of the assumptions  stated in these reports.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The objective of this report is to support stakeholders carrying out more detailed threat analyses  and risk assessments focussed on particular elements of the 5G infrastructure. Given the  current maturity of both 5G specifications and deployments, it is very likely that this need exists  across all types of involved stakeholders. Publicly available threat and risk analyses  demonstrate the current level of existing 5G assessments that are at rather high and/or abstract  level. To this extent, the information provided in this report may help stakeholders to understand  the details of 5G infrastructures and the corresponding threat exposure. Moreover, it outlines  the gaps supporting the identification of ‘known unknowns’. We believe that this could be a  valuable contribution towards the identification areas of future work.  13 https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html, accessed September 2019.  The 5G threat  landscape may  be useful to carry  out detailed  threat analyses  and risk  assessments for  telecom  operators and  service providers  according to their  particular needs  and mandate.

Both the asset inventory and threat taxonomy can be used  as-is or further developed by telco operators or other stakeholders through their own threat  analysis and risk assessments. The assessment of threats and vulnerabilities may also enrich a  more in-depth analysis of certain components, as far as they are relevant to the assets  deployed by the MNOs.  Moreover, many other non-technical stakeholders (e.g. policy-makers, regulators, law  enforcement, among others) may find this report useful to understand the current state of  threats and respective mitigation practices and measures. For example, the threat landscape  identified in this report may support policy actions in the areas of 5G networks, SDN, NFV,  cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and other sectors/verticals that plan to use the  5G Network.  Finally, research projects may find the information this report useful in a twofold manner: to be  used for threat/risk assessments of newly developed 5G components or to be used as a guide  to conduct gap analysis, driving thus new research projects.  1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  This report presents the results of the assessment conducted during the research work using  the following structure:   Chapter 2 presents the stakeholders having a role in deployment, operation and  supervision of the 5G infrastructure. They constitute an essential part of the 5G  ecosystem. Furthermore, stakeholders are the ones responsible for mitigating the  threats identified in this report by introducing specific countermeasures that reduce the  risks.   Chapter 3 presents the architectural framework of 5G technology by offering a generic  architecture and providing various ‘Zoom-ins’ describing the details of various  components. These details will contribute to the process of identifying the critical  assets of the technology.   Chapter 4 presents the 5G asset types identified in our study by providing an overview  and identifying groups in the form of a mind map available in annex A. The assets were  identified based on the multiple vulnerabilities pointed by the various contributors.   Chapter 5 presents a taxonomy of threats. Interrelated threats have been grouped to  form a taxonomy that is presented as a detailed mind map in Annex B.   Chapter 6 provides information on threat agents. It is a first approach towards the  assessment of potential motives emerging from the abuse/misuse of 5G assets.   Chapter 7 provides recommendations and conclusions drawn from the threat analysis.  The material used in the analysis produced for this report, which is referenced in footnotes  through URLs, was last accessed on the day of publication of this study. The referenced  material will help interested readers to dive into further detail in the complexity of the 5G  infrastructure when needed.

Among other things, these entities  will be responsible for assuring the security of the network at different levels and in separate  layers. According to the 5G-PPP White Paper on the architecture,14 the list of stakeholder roles  in the 5G ecosystem is the following:   Service customers (SC);   Service providers (SP);   Mobile Network Operators (MNO) also known as Network Operators (NOP);   Virtualisation Infrastructure Service Providers (VISP);   Data Centre Providers (DCSP).  Through the elaborations of this report, some additional stakeholders have been identified.  Their role is being characterized by the ownership/responsibility relationships to the 5G assets  described in this document. In addition, they have been assessed from input received from  involved experts. Although their role is not fully defined yet, it is believed that they are/will be  concerned with various issues related to the security of the 5G ecosystem. In the following list,  we present a short indicative note for each entity and its role:   Internet Exchange Points (IXPs): Being an important part of current Internet  infrastructure, IXPs (data network) providers play an important role in 5G, as they  support the end-to-end throughput of the data traffic.15   National Regulators (NRAs): Regulators will be asked to regulate various areas of  the 5G infrastructure (frequencies, identifiers, traffic laws, etc.).16   Information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs): ISACs will have to collect and  share 5G related intelligence. This can be achieved either by means of existing ISACs  and/or specific 5G ISACs.   National cybersecurity coordinators/agencies/centres (NCSCs): Existing  cybersecurity centres need to engage in 5G infrastructure matters in order to evaluate  and scrutinize major risks at national level, emanating from 5G infrastructure  deployments.17   National 5G Test Centres (NTCs): The creation of national 5G test centres has been  taken forward in some Member States in order to assess the quality and security of 5G  solutions.18 It is expected that this trend will lead to the creation of such facilities in  multiple EU Member States.   National Certification Authorities (NCAs): Given the fact that certification is a major  security control to be implemented for 5G components, it is expected that various  14 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_v3.0_PublicConsultation.pdf,  accessed September 2019.  15 http://www.leedsgrowthstrategy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WHY-5G-IN-LEEDS.pdf, accessed September 2019.  16 http://www.emergonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Introduction_to_5G_Amman.pdf, accessed September 2019.  17 https://www.ft.com/content/29eb5d28-e10d-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad, accessed September 2019.  18 https://dcnnmagazine.com/networking/telecoms-networking/manyooth-university-opens-radiospace-5g-test-centre/,  assessed September 2019.  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5G-PPP-5G-Architecture-White-Paper_v3.0_PublicConsultation.pdf http://www.leedsgrowthstrategy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/WHY-5G-IN-LEEDS.pdf http://www.emergonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Introduction_to_5G_Amman.pdf https://www.ft.com/content/29eb5d28-e10d-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad https://dcnnmagazine.com/networking/telecoms-networking/manyooth-university-opens-radiospace-5g-test-centre/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  15  players will be active in definition and implementation of national 5G certification and  accreditation schemes.   Competent EU institutions and European Commission Services: These entities  will play a significant role in the coordination of national activities, standardisation work,  research projects and policy initiatives.  In different roles, the entities mentioned above should have different levels of concern regarding  5G assets, among other things carrying responsibility for the risk mitigation affecting those  assets. Stakeholders must develop strategies that, independently or co-responsibly, allow  reduction of exposure to cyberthreats.  Annex D shows the relationships between Stakeholders and 5G asset groups, helping the  reader to understand their potential involvement in the (risk/threat) management of the assets.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  16  3. 5G NETWORK DESIGN AND  ARCHITECTURE  To support the identification of the most sensitive assets, a 5G architecture was developed for  this report. This architecture resulted from the analysis of various publicly available reports  published by standardisation, research and scientific bodies (e.g. 14, 19,24,25,26,27,28). This task  aimed at establishing a common and coherent understanding over the components of the 5G  architecture. Despite a large number of documents referring to various aspects of the 5G  architecture (e.g. individual network functions, interfaces, security functions, various 5G  domains, etc.), only a few provide a compressive overview. For the present work, the  visualisation of the different components in a modular and general manner was required. Once  the comprehensive technical 5G architecture has been defined, and after reviewing known  weaknesses of components, it was possible to list the sensitive assets and describe the most  relevant threats.  For this reason, the approach taken for this report was to develop a generic 5G architecture and  provide the details of individual key components by means of ‘Zoom-ins’, allowing further  detailing of their functionality and purpose. By doing so, besides the generic 5G architecture  depicted, we deliver a number of detailed views of particular components, namely: Core  Network, Management and Network Orchestrator (MANO), Radio Access Network (RAN),  Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Software Defined Network (SDN), Multi-access Edge  Computing (MEC), User Equipment (UE), Security Architecture (SA) and 5G Physical  Infrastructure components.  To deal with complexity, both at the level of the generic 5G architecture and individual ‘Zoom-  ins’, the details of the various interfaces and protocols have not been considered. A short  description of the purpose and functionality is provided in a separate table for each individual  component. A generic 5G architecture and the corresponding ‘Zoom-ins’ will help the  identification of sensitive assets presented in chapter 4.2.  3.1 5G USE CASES  The description of the network design and architecture is started by explaining the different Use  Cases defined for 5G Networks. 3GPP defined these Use Cases as part of its New Services  and Markets Technology Enabler (SMARTER) project.19 The objective behind SMARTER was  to develop high-level use cases and identify which features and functionalities are required to  enable them. The process started in 2015 and resulted in over 70 use cases, initially grouped  into five categories, which have been reduced to three. The three sets of Use Cases are as  follows.   Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB).20 Defined as an extension to existing 4G  broadband services, eMBB will be the first commercial 5G service enabling faster and more  reliable downloads. The thresholds defined in the ITU requirements for eMBB sets at a  minimum of 20Gbps for downlink and 10Gbps for uplink. Furthermore, the minimum  requirement for eMBB mobility interruption time is 0ms.  19 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01_10-Nov_Session-3_Dino-Flore.pdf, accessed September 2019.  20 https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-enhanced-mobile-broadband-embb/, accessed September 2019.  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/01_10-Nov_Session-3_Dino-Flore.pdf https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-enhanced-mobile-broadband-embb/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  17   Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). The promise to delivery ultra-reliable  and low-latency communication for 5G wireless networks is considered of capital  importance. URLLC is designed to support businesses on mission critical communication  scenarios, such as emergency situations, autonomous systems operations, among  others.21 Examples include public safety services, operations of mining, autonomous  vehicles, oil and gas pipelines, robots, medical and entertainment. Achieving URLLC  represents one of the major challenges facing 5G networks.   Machine Type Communications (MTC).22 This Use Case is expected to play an essential  role in the future of 5G systems. In the seventh framework programme (FP7) project  METIS, 23 MTC has been further classified as ‘massive machine‐type communication’  (mMTC) and ‘ultra‐reliable machine‐type communication’ (uMTC). While mMTC is about  wireless connectivity to tens of billions of machine‐type terminals, uMTC is about  availability, low latency, and high reliability. The main challenges in mMTC is to deliver  scalable and efficient connectivity for a massive number of devices sending very short  packets, which is not done adequately in cellular systems designed for human‐type  communications. Furthermore, mMTC solutions need to enable wide area coverage and  deep indoor penetration while having low cost and being energy efficient. For MTC, ITU  defined a minimum requirement for connection density of 1,000,000 devices per km2.  Multiple deployment scenarios for eMBB, mMTC and URLLC can be envisioned in future  implementations of this technology. A study developed by ETSI identified some of these future  scenarios presented in Table 1.24  Table 1 - 5G deployment scenarios  Deployment Scenarios  Indoor hotspot  The indoor hotspot deployment scenario focuses on small coverage per site/TRxP (transmission and  reception point) and high user throughput or user density in buildings. The key characteristics of this  deployment scenario are high capacity, high user density and consistent user experience indoor.  Dense urban  The dense urban microcellular deployment scenario focuses on macro TRxPs with or without micro  TRxPs and high user densities and traffic loads in city centres and dense urban areas. The key  characteristics of this deployment scenario are high traffic loads, outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor  coverage. This scenario will be interference-limited, using macro TRxPs with or without micro TRxPs. A  continuous cellular layout and the associated interference shall be assumed.

The key  characteristics of this scenario are continuous and ubiquitous coverage in urban areas. This scenario will  be interference-limited, using macro TRxPs (i.e. radio access points above rooftop level).  High speed  The high-speed deployment scenario focuses on continuous coverage along track in high speed trains.  The key characteristics of this scenario are consistent passenger user experience and critical train  communication reliability with very high mobility. In this deployment scenario, dedicated linear  deployment along railway line and the deployments including SFN scenarios captured in Section 6.2 of  3GPP TR 36.878 are considered, and passenger UEs are located in train carriages.25 For the passenger  UEs, if the antenna of relay node for eNB-to-Relay is located at top of one carriage of the train, the  antenna of relay node for Relay-to-UE could be distributed to all carriages.  Extreme long distance coverage in low density areas  The extreme Long Range deployment scenario is defined to allow for the Provision of services for very  large areas with low density of users whether they are humans and machines (e.g. Low ARPU regions,  wilderness, areas where only highways are located, etc). The key characteristics of this scenario are  Macro cells with very large area coverage supporting basic data speeds and voice services, with low to  moderate user throughput and low user density.  Urban coverage for massive connection  The urban coverage for massive connection scenario focuses on large cells and continuous coverage to  provide mMTC. The key characteristics of this scenario are continuous and ubiquitous coverage in urban  areas, with very high connection density of mMTC devices.  The main drivers identified for these Use Cases - reflected in the requirements and  specifications of 5G Networks - are bandwidth, latency, availability, reliability, efficiency and  coverage. In the next sections, we will present the critical elements of the network architecture  that will enable these Use Cases.  3.2 GENERIC 5G ARCHITECTURE  The generic 5G architecture is presented through its main components depicted as labelled  boxes. These boxes have been arranged based on layers, depicting their functional role in the  5G architecture (i.e. virtualisation layer and physical infrastructure layer). This architecture aims  at providing an overview of the main groups of foreseen 5G functionality and is a consolidation  of components/functions found in the analysed material (e.g.14,19,24,25,26,27,28).  Specifically in 5G, the architecture was designed in a way that connectivity and services of data  can be supported, enabling techniques such as Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Network  Slicing (NS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). This service-based architecture meets  multiple functional and performance requirements built upon new use cases in a cost efficient  way.  The generic 5G architecture presents an overview of the various components that are further  detailed and depicted through specific ‘Zoom-ins’ in forthcoming sections. It is worth mentioning  that for the OSS/BSS component, no ‘Zoom-in’ was developed. However, it has been included  in the generic 5G architecture for consistency reasons.  The 5G generic or high-level technical architecture is depicted in the following figure:  25 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2885, accessed  September 2019.  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2885  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  19  Figure 2: 5G High-level technical architecture  3.3 CORE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most important innovations in the 5G architecture is the complete virtualisation of the  Core network. As an example, the ‘softwarisation’ of network functions will enable easier  portability and higher flexibility of networking systems and services (Control-User Plain  Separation, CUPS). The Software Defined Network (SDN) brings simplified management  together with innovation through abstraction. Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) provides the  enabling technology for placing various network functions in different network components on  the basis of performance needs/requirements; and eliminates the need for function- or service-  specific hardware. SDN and NFV, complementing each other, improve the network elasticity,  simplify network control and management, break the barrier of vendor-specific or proprietary  solutions, and are thus considered as highly important for future networks. These novel network  technologies and concepts - heavily relying on ‘softwarisation’ and virtualisation of network  functions will introduce new and complex threats.  The Core network is the central part of the 5G infrastructure and enables new functions related  to multi-access technologies. Its main purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks  (wireless, fixed, converged).26  The Core network has been defined by 3GPP27 and its structure is as follows:  26 https://www.nokia.com/networks/portfolio/5g-core/#defining-a-new-5g-core, accessed September 2019.  27 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/123500_123599/123501/15.02.00_60/ts_123501v150200p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  https://www.nokia.com/networks/portfolio/5g-core/#defining-a-new-5g-core https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/123500_123599/123501/15.02.00_60/ts_123501v150200p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  20  Figure 3: Core network architecture zoom-in  A description of the elements of the 5G Core network is as follows:  Element Short description  Access and Mobility  Management function  (AMF)  (As defined in 3GPP TS23.501 Section 6.2.1)28  AMF may include the following functionalities:   Termination of RAN CP interface;   Termination of NAS, NAS ciphering and integrity  protection;   Registration management;   Connection management;   Reachability management;   Mobility Management;   Lawful interception;   Provide transport for SM messages between UE and  SMF;   Transparent proxy for routing SM messages;  28 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3144, accessed  September 2019.  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3144  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  21   Access Authentication;   Access Authorization;   Provide transport for SMS messages between UE and  SMSF;   Security Anchor Functionality;   Location Services management for regulatory services;   Provide transport for Location Services messages  between UE and LMF as well as between RAN and LMF  and   EPS Bearer ID allocation for interworking with EPS; UE  mobility event notification.

A  clear benefit of 5G network slicing for operators will be the ability to deploy only the functions  necessary to support specific customers and particular market segments.31  Communication between autonomous cars, for instance, requires minimal latency (the lag time  it takes for a signal to travel), but not necessarily high throughput (the amount of data a network  can process per second) while a use-case such as augmented reality will take more bandwidth.  30 https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/, accessed September 2019.  31 www.5gamericas.org/files/3214/7975/0104/5G_Americas_Network_Slicing_11.21_Final.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.sdxcentral.com/5g/definitions/5g-network-slicing/ http://www.5gamericas.org/files/3214/7975/0104/5G_Americas_Network_Slicing_11.21_Final.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  24  With slicing, these needs can be accommodated by delegating each to its own network-within-  a-network.  Network Slicing components are presented in relation to the impacted elements of the network  architecture, as depicted in the various ‘Zoom-ins’. This cross-reference/mapping is an  alternative means for describing slice functions of 5G. The dependency of slices with the  various components of the 5G generic architecture is shown in the figure below:  Figure 4: Dependencies of slices with the generic 5G architecture components  The various slice functions of 5G are as follows:  Relevant element  Referenced generic 5G  architecture components  Slice function  Network Slice  Management Function  (NSMF)  Access Network, Core  Network  This function is responsible for  the management (including  lifecycle) of NSIs. It derives  network slice subnet related  requirements from the network  slice related requirements.

SDN Controller  Access Network, Core  Network  The NSI is realized via the  required physical and logical  resources.  the tenant SDN controller  dynamically configures the  (other) inner network slice's  VNFs, and properly chains them  to build up the Network  Service(s) that the slice needs to  accommodate for a given use  case.  NFV Orchestrator  Management and  Orchestration  Since SDN and NFV are  considered enabling techniques  for network slicing, MANO  activities are concerned with the  orchestration perspective that  involves transforming a service  using NFV infrastructure.  Each of the network slices  serving a tenant comprises an  NFVO.  The NFVO dynamically manages  the lifecycle of the network slice  constituent network service(s).  VNF Manager  Management and  Orchestration  VNF Manager is responsible for  VNF lifecycle management (e.g.  instantiation, update, query,  scaling and termination).  Each of the network slices  serving a tenant comprises one  or several VNFM(s).  The VNFM(s) perform(s) lifecycle  management operations over the  slice VNFs.  Operations Support  System/Business  Support System  (OSS/BSS)  Management and  Orchestration  Since Network Services and  VNF operations are highly  correlated, once it is made aware  by the NFVO that a Network  Service has been instantiated,  there is a need for the OSS, VNF  configuration and chaining tasks.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  26  Communication  Service Management  Function (CSMF)  Management and  Orchestration  This function is responsible for  translating the communication  service related requirement to  network slice related  requirements. The CSMF  communicates with the Network  Slice Management Function  (NSMF).  Os-Ma-nfvo Management and  orchestration, Resources  the Os-Ma-nfvo reference point  can be used for the interaction  between 3GPP slicing related  management functions and NFV-  MANO. To properly interface  with NFV-MANO, the NSMF  and/or NSSMF need to  determine the type of NS or set  of NSs, VNF and PNF that can  support the resource  requirements for a NSI or NSSI,  and whether new instances of  these NSs, VNFs and the  connectivity to the PNFs need to  be created or existing instances  can be re-used.  3.5 MANAGEMENT AND NETWORK ORCHESTRATOR (MANO) (ZOOM-  IN)  Management and Network Orchestrator is one of the most important components of the 5G  infrastructure. It is responsible for the configuration and management of all significant  components/functions of 5G, including Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Virtualised  Network Functions (VNF) management, and Virtualised Infrastructure Management (VIM). The  MANO structure presented here corresponds to the ETSI MANO concept.32  The structure of the MANO architecture is depicted in the following figure:  32 https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/slides/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/slides/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  27  Figure 5: MANO architecture zoom-in  A short description of the various elements of MANO shown in this figure is as follows:  Element Short description  NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) The NFV Orchestrator has two main responsibilities:   the orchestration of NFVI resources across multiple  VIMs and   the lifecycle management of Network Services.  VNF manager (VNFM)  The VNF Manager is responsible for the lifecycle  management of VNF instances.  Virtualised infrastructure  manager (VIM)  The Virtualised Infrastructure Manager (VIM) is responsible  for controlling and managing the NFVI computing, storage  and networking resources, usually within one operator's  Infrastructure Domain.  A VIM may be specialized in handling a certain type of  NFVI resource (e.g. compute-only, storage-only,  networking-only), or may be capable of managing multiple  types of NFVI resources (e.g. in NFVI-Nodes).  Element Management (EM) The Element Management is responsible for:  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  28  • Configuration for the network functions provided by the  VNF.  • Fault management for the network functions provided by  the VNF.  • Accounting for the usage of VNF functions.  • Collecting performance measurement results for the  functions provided by the VNF.  • Security management for the VNF functions.  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI). The NFVI encompasses all the hardware (e.g. compute,  storage, and networking) and software (e.g. hypervisors)  components that together provide the infrastructure  resources where VNFs are deployed.  Operations Support  System/Business Support  System (OSS/BSS)  OSS/BSS functions provide management and  orchestration of systems including legacy ones and may  have full end-to-end visibility of services provided by legacy  network functions in an operator's network.  Processes covered by OSS/BSS include: Network  Management, Service delivery / fulfilment / assurance,  Customer Relationship management and Billing.  NS Catalogue The NS Catalogue represents the repository of all of the  on-boarded Network Services, supporting the creation and  management of the NS deployment templates (Network  Service Descriptor (NSD), Virtual Link Descriptor (VLD),  and VNF Forwarding Graph Descriptor (VNFFGD) via  interface operations exposed by the NFVO.  VNF Catalogue The VNF Catalogue represents the repository of all of the  on-boarded VNF Packages, supporting the creation and  management of the VNF Package (VNF Descriptor  (VNFD), software images, manifest files, etc.) via interface  operations exposed by the NFVO.  NFV Instances repository The NFV Instances repository holds information of all VNF  instances and Network Service instances. Those records  are updated during the lifecycle of the respective instances,  reflecting changes resulting from execution of NS lifecycle  management operations and/or VNF lifecycle management  operations.  NFVI Resources repository As such, the NFVI Resources repository plays an important  role in supporting NFVO's Resource Orchestration and  governance role, by allowing NFVI reserved/allocated  resources to be tracked against the NS and VNF instances  associated with those resources (e.g. number of VMs used  by a certain VNF instance at any time during its lifecycle).

The SDAP architecture  includes a Packet Data Conversion Protocol (PDCP) located in the CU and an Air Radio Link  Control (ARLC) located in the DU. All this is based on IP transport on a TNL/Ethernet network,  very similar to the mobile backhaul of today. Another key aspect of the NG-RAN is the ability to  provide small-cell coverage to multiple operators ‘as-a-service’ in two-tier architecture. These  tiers are in support of the previously mentioned 5G use cases providing low latency services  and high processing power.  The structure of the RAN architecture is depicted in the figure below:  Figure 6: RAN architecture zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  30  The elements of the RAN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  User Equipment (UE) User equipment is any device used by users to  communicate within the 5G infrastructure. Besides a SIM,  user equipment may be home appliances of any kind (e.g.  computer, IoT devices,etc.).  Radio Unit (RU) Is an element connecting user equipment with the  operator network.  gNB Next generation Node/Base Station is a node providing  NR user plane and control plane protocol terminations  towards the UE, and connected via the NG interface to  the 5GC.  gNB Distributed Unit (gNB-  DU)  gNB-DU a logical node hosting RLC, MAC and PHY  layers of the gNB or en-gNB, and its operation is partly  controlled by gNB-CU. One gNB-DU supports one or  multiple cells. One cell is supported by only one gNB-DU.  The gNB-DU terminates the F1 interface connected with  the gNB-CU.  gNB Central Unit (gNB-CU) gNB-Central Unit (CU) is a logical node hosting RRC,  SDAP and PDCP protocols of the gNB or RRC and PDCP  protocols of the en-gNB that controls the operation of one  or more gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU terminates the F1  interface connected with the gNB-DU.  Access and Mobility  Management function  (AMF)  AMF is a Network Function (NF). It includes some or all  following functionalities:   Termination of RAN CP interface;   Termination of NAS ;   NAS ciphering and integrity protection;   Registration management;   Connection management;   Reachability management;   Mobility Management;   Lawful intercept;   Transport for SM messages between UE and SMF;   Transparent proxy for routing SM messages;   Access authentication; access authorization;   Transport for SMS messages between UE and  SMSF; security anchor functionality (SEAF) ;  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  31   Location services management; transport for  Location Services messages between UE and LMF  and between RAN and LMF;   EPS Bearer ID allocation for interworking with EPS:   UE mobility event notification.

Non Access Stratum (NAS) NAS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE  and Core Network. (NAS) protocol for 5G System.  (defined in 3GPP TS 24.501). 28  Access Stratum (AS) AS is a functional layer in the protocol stack between UE  and RAN responsible for transporting data over the  wireless connection and managing radio resources.  3.7 NETWORK FUNCTION VIRTUALISATION (NFV) (ZOOM-IN)  NFV introduces a new concept for service providers to accelerate the deployment of new  network services in support of their revenue and growth plans. It translates to the use of  standard IT virtualisation technologies applied to the deployment of Network Functions, aiming  at a faster provision of new network services. With this, several providers formed the NFV ISG  under the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The foundation of NFV’s  basic requirements and architecture resulted from the work produced by ETSI NFV ISG. 36,37  Although 5G networks will be very different compared to its predecessors in some regards (e.g.  through the use of virtualisation and support for diverse and critical non-telecom-oriented  services), they still share similarities and will reuse and extend existing concepts that have  proved successful and are widely adopted.  The NFV has a tight interaction with Virtual Network Functions (VNF), MANO and OSS/BSS  and security management components.

Virtualised Network  Function (VNF)  A VNF is a virtualisation of a network function in a legacy  non-virtualised network. ETSI GS NFV 001 provides a list of  use cases and examples of target network functions (NFs) for  virtualisation. Functional behaviour and state of a NF are  largely independent of whether the NF is virtualised or not.  The functional behaviour and the external operational  interfaces of a Physical Network Function (PNF) and a VNF  are expected to be the same.  Element Management  (EM)  The Element Management is responsible for:  • Configuration for the network functions provided by the  VNF.  • Fault management for the network functions provided by the  VNF.  • Accounting for the usage of VNF functions.  • Collecting performance measurement results for the  functions provided by the VNF.  • Security management for the VNF functions.  NFV Infrastructure  (NFVI)  The NFV Infrastructure corresponds to the total of all  hardware and software components which build up the  environment in which VNFs are deployed, managed and  executed. The NFV Infrastructure can span across several  locations, i.e. places where NFVI-PoPs are operated. The  network providing connectivity between these locations is  regarded to be part of the NFV Infrastructure. From the VNF's  perspective, the virtualisation layer and the hardware  resources look like a single entity providing the VNF with  desired virtualised resources.  Hardware Resources In NFV, the physical hardware resources include computing,  storage and network that provide processing, storage and  connectivity to VNFs through the virtualisation layer (e.g.  hypervisor). Computing hardware is assumed to be COTS as  opposed to purpose-built hardware. Storage resources can  be differentiated between shared network attached storage  (NAS) and storage that resides on the server itself.  Computing and storage resources are commonly pooled.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  34  Network resources are comprised of switching functions, e.g.  routers, and wired or wireless links.  Virtualisation Layer and  Virtualised Resources  The virtualisation layer abstracts the hardware resources and  decouples the VNF software from the underlying hardware,  thus ensuring a hardware independent lifecycle for the VNFs.  In short, the virtualisation layer is responsible for: •Abstracting  and logically partitioning physical resources, commonly as a  hardware abstraction layer. i) Enabling the software that  implements the VNF to use the underlying virtualised  infrastructure; ii) Providing virtualised resources to the VNF,  so that the latter can be executed.  Virtualised Infrastructure  Manager  From NFV's point of view, virtualised infrastructure  management comprises the functionalities that are used to  control and manage the interaction of a VNF with computing,  storage and network resources under its authority, as well as  their virtualisation. According to the list of hardware resources  specified in the architecture, the Virtualised Infrastructure  Manager performs resource and operations management.  Multiple Virtualised Infrastructure Manager instances may be  deployed.  NFV Orchestrator The NFV Orchestrator is in charge of the orchestration and  management of NFV infrastructure and software resources,  and realizing network services on NFVI  VNF Manager VNF Manager is responsible for VNF lifecycle management  (e.g. instantiation, update, query, scaling, termination).  Multiple VNF Managers may be deployed; a VNF Manager  may be deployed for each VNF, or a VNF Manager may  serve multiple VNFs.  Os-Ma-nfvo This reference point is used for exchanges between  OSS/BSS and NFV Orchestrator, and supports the following:  • Network Service Descriptor and VNF package  management.  • Network Service instance lifecycle management  • VNF lifecycle management  • Policy management and/or enforcement for Network  Service instances, VNF instances and NFVI resources  • Querying relevant Network Service instance and VNF  instance information from the OSS/BSS.  • Forwarding of events, accounting and usage records  and performance measurement results regarding  Network Service instances, VNF instances, and NFVI  resources to OSS/BSS, as well as and information  about the associations between those instances and  NFVI resources  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  35  Ve-Vnfm-em This reference point is used for exchanges between EM and  VNF Manager, and supports the following functions:  VNF instantiation / VNF instance query / VNF instance  update / VNF instance scaling out-in, and up-down / VNF  instance termination / Forwarding of configuration and events  from the EM to the VNFM / Forwarding of configuration and  events regarding the VNF from the VNFM to the EM.  NOTE: This reference point is only used if the EM is aware of  virtualisation.  Ve-Vnfm-vnf This reference point is used for exchanges between VNF and  VNF Manager, and supports the following:  VNF instantiation / VNF instance query / VNF instance  update / VNF instance scaling out-in, and up-down / VNF  instance termination / Forwarding of configuration and events  from the VNF to the VNFM / Forwarding of configuration,  events, etc. regarding VNF, from the VNFM to the VNF /  Verification that the VNF is still alive/functional.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (Nf-Vi)  This reference point is used for: Specific assignment of  virtualised resources in response to resource allocation  requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state  information (e.g. events) exchange.  NFV Security Manager  (NSM)  NSM is the logical functional block for overall security  management, e.g. on the behalf of network services. In  cooperation with MANO blocks dedicated to managing the  virtualised network, the policy driven NSM is specialized to  manage the security on a network service over its entire  lifecycle. It covers the following functionalities:  • Security Policy Planning, designs and optimizes security  policies for specific targets of protection (e.g. network  services).  • Security Policy Enforcement & Validation automates the  deployment and supports lifecycle management of  security functions as defined in the design phase, then  configure security policies on the security functions. In  addition, during lifetime of a network service, the  validation and re-configuration/remediation of  associated security policies is supported, also in  automated manner.  • NFVI Security Manager (ISM) – see below.  NFVI Security Manager  (ISM)  NFVI Security Manager is the logical function dedicated to  security management in NFVI layer. It builds and manages  the security in NFVI to support NSM requests for managing  security of network services in higher layer.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  36  Security Element  Manager (SEM)  SEM refers to Element Manager managing Security  Functions.  Virtual Security Function  (VSF)  This element is a special type of VNF running on top of NFVI  with tailored security functionality (e.g. firewall, IDS/IPS,  virtualised security monitoring functions like vFEP, vTap).  VSFs are mainly required to protect the other VNFs, which  constitute a network service. VSF is managed by either  dedicated VNFM or generic VNFM with respect to its  lifecycle.  NFVI-based Security  Function (ISF)  This element is a security function provided by the NFV  Infrastructure. It includes virtualised security appliances or  software security features (e.g. hypervisor-based firewalls)  and hardware-based security appliances/modules/features  (e.g. Hardware Security Modules, Crypto Accelerators, or  Trusted Platform Modules).  Physical Security  Function (PSF)  This element is a conventionally realized security function in  the physical part of the hybrid network. Even if a telco  network is virtualised, additional PSFs are still needed, for  instance to protect the NFV infrastructure (and inherently, the  Network Services running on top) as a whole. PSF is part of  the non-virtualised traditional network and not maintained by  the NFVI provider, hence it is managed by the SEM instead  of the VIM.  NFVI - Virtualised  Infrastructure Manager  (NF-Vi)  This reference point is used for: Specific assignment of  virtualised resources in response to resource allocation  requests / Forwarding of virtualised resources state  information / Hardware resource configuration and state  information (e.g. events) exchange.  3.8 SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORK (SDN) (ZOOM-IN)  5G will be driven by the influence of software managing network functions, known as Software  Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV). The key concept that  underpins SDNs is the logical centralisation of network control functions by decoupling the  control and packet-forwarding functionality of the network. While SDN separates the control and  forwarding planes, NFV primarily focuses on optimising the network services themselves. NFV  complements this vision through the virtualisation of these functionalities based on recent  advances in general server and enterprise IT virtualisation. The SDN threats presented in this  document are also the ones described in the ENISA Thematic Landscape SDN/5G38Error!  Bookmark not defined..  As previously mentioned, the fundamental concept of SDN relies on decoupling the control and  the packet forwarding functionality in the network. In classic networks, these two functionalities  are under the responsibility of the forwarding devices (physical) of the network. In SDN, these  two functionalities have been separated into two functionality planes: the control plane and the  38 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape, accessed October 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/sdn-threat-landscape  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  37  data plane. The separation of these two functionality planes in SDNs has two significant  consequences:  a) it reduces the difficulty in the configuration and alteration of the control functions of the  network, as this functionality has no longer the responsibility of the forwarding devices  of the network that tend to have proprietary implementations (e.g., operating systems),  and  b) it enables the implementation of more consistent control policies through fewer and  uniformly accessible controllers.  The typical SDN architecture, as described by the Open Networking Foundation,39 is shown in  the figure below:  Figure 8: SDN architecture zoom-in  39 https://www.opennetworking.org/, accessed September 2019.  https://www.opennetworking.org/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  38  The elements of the SDN architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  SDN controller SDN Controller: The SDN Controller is a logically centralized entity  in charge of:  • Translating the requirements from the SDN Application layer  down to the SDN Resources and  • Providing the SDN Applications with an abstract view of the  network (which may include statistics and events).  SDN Application SDN Applications are programs that explicitly, directly, and  programmatically communicate their network requirements and  desired network behaviour to the SDN Controller.  Multiple case  scenarios might be envisioned, for the position of the SDN  applications in the NFV architectural framework, such as:  • the network hardware might be a physical appliance talking to  an SDN controller, or a complete solution including multiple  SDN components, such as SDN controller + SDN application  for instance;  • the VIM might be an application interfacing with an SDN  controller in the NFVI - for instance OpenStack Neutron as a  VIM interfacing with an SDN controller in the NFVI;  • the SDN application might be a VNF talking to an SDN  controller, being Virtualised or not. For instance a PCRF VNF  might talk to an SDN controller for some policy management  for traffic steering;  • the SDN application might be an element manager interfacing  with an SDN controller to collect some metrics or configure  some parameters, and  • the SDN application might be an application interfacing with  an SDN controller for instance in the OSS-BSS for tenant  SDN service definitions.  SDN resources Multiple scenarios might be envisaged for the actual location of  SDN resources:  • physical switch or router;  • virtual switch or router;  • e-switch, software based SDN enabled switch in a server NIC  and  • switch or router as a Virtual network function (VNF).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  39  3.9 MULTI-ACCESS EDGE COMPUTING (MEC) (ZOOM-IN)  Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) stands for the provision of cloud computing capabilities at  the edge of the network, that is, for high bandwidth, low latency end- user applications.40 MEC is  located in the logical vicinity of base stations through authorised third parties willing to offer  processing and storage capabilities to subscribers of the 5G network. MEC is a novel approach  in the 5G ecosystem that enhances mobile user experience by covering services that, in  previous generations, were using the run-time of end-user devices.  Through the capabilities of MEC, a variety of services can be bundled/converged into a single  component, such as video, location services, virtual reality, etc. It is expected that MEC is going  to emerge following the evolution of application services and verticals and will be one of the  main drivers for a wider coverage and penetration of 5G Networks.  Besides offering these services, MEC takes an important role in the 5G infrastructure. It  possesses orchestration functions, interacts with the 5G policy component and supports life-  cycle matters of the offered applications.  The structure of MEC and its elements is shown in the figure below:  Figure 9: MEC architecture zoom-in  40 https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing?jjj=1568718105743, accessed September 2019.  https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing?jjj=1568718105743  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  40  The elements of MEC are as follows:  Element Short description  Customer facing service  (CFS) portal  The customer facing service portal allows operators' third-  party customers (e.g. commercial enterprises) to select and  order a set of MEC applications that meet their particular  needs, and to receive back service level information from the  provisioned applications.  Device application Device applications as defined in the present document are  applications in the device (e.g. UE, laptop with internet  connectivity) that have the capability to interact with the MEC  system via a user application lifecycle management proxy.  User application life-  cycle management  (LCM) proxy  The user application lifecycle management proxy allows  device applications to request on-boarding, instantiation,  termination of user applications and when supported,  relocation of user applications in and out of the MEC system.  It also allows informing the device applications about the  state of the user applications.  The user application lifecycle  management proxy authorizes requests from device  applications in the device and interacts with the OSS and the  multi-access edge orchestrator for further processing of these  requests.  Multi-access edge  orchestrator  The multi-access edge orchestrator is the core functionality in  MEC system level management, responsible for the following  functions: maintaining an overall view of the MEC system; on-  boarding of application packages; selecting appropriate MEC  host(s) for application instantiation; triggering application  instantiation and termination; triggering application relocation  as needed when supported.  MEC host MEC host is an entity that contains a MEC platform and a  virtualisation infrastructure which provides compute, storage,  and network resources, for the purpose of running MEC  applications.  Virtualisation  infrastructure  It provides compute, storage, and network resources for the  MEC applications. The virtualisation infrastructure includes a  data plane that executes the traffic rules received by the MEC  platform, and routes the traffic among applications, services,  DNS server/proxy, 3GPP network, other access networks,  local networks and external networks.  MEC platform It is the collection of essential functionality required to run  MEC applications on a particular virtualisation infrastructure  and enable them to provide and consume MEC services. The  MEC platform can also provide services.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  41  MEC applications MEC applications are instantiated on the virtualisation  infrastructure of the MEC host, based on configuration or  requests validated by the MEC management.  MEC service It is a service provided via the MEC platform either by the  MEC platform itself or by a MEC application.  Service registry In MEC, the services produced by the MEC applications are  registered in the service registry of the MEC platform – as  opposed to the network functions and the services they  produce which are registered in the Network Resource  Function (NRF).  Data Plane Data plane described in this diagram is only a representation  of the execution environment for the traffic rules and routing.  Mapping of all or part of MEC data plane functionality to any  functional element(s) of a real network architecture implies a  specific deployment option of MEC in such a network  architecture.  MEC host level  management  It handles the management of the MEC specific functionality  of a particular MEC host and the applications running on it. Is  comprised of the MEC platform manager and the  virtualisation infrastructure manager.  MEC platform manager  The MEC platform manager is responsible for the following  functions:  • Managing the life cycle of applications including  informing the multi-access edge orchestrator of relevant  application related events;  • Providing element management functions to the MEC  platform and  • Managing the application rules and requirements.  The MEC platform manager also receives virtualised  resources fault reports and performance measurements from  the virtualisation infrastructure manager for further  processing.  Virtualisation  infrastructure manager  The functionality provided by the virtualisation infrastructure  manager in this ‘Zoom-in’ overlaps generally with the  functionality provided by the VIM described in the NFV  ‘Zoom-in’.  Inter-MEC system  communication  Inter MEC systems communication is implementing three  interfaces that are necessary for the communication between  various MECs. In particular:  • A MEC platform should be able to discover other MEC  platforms that may belong to different MEC systems;  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  42  • A MEC platform should be able to exchange information  in a secure manner with other MEC platforms that may  belong to different MEC systems.  • A MEC application should be able to exchange  information in a secure manner with other MEC  applications that may belong to different MEC systems.  3.10 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE (SA) (ZOOM-IN)  The 5G security architecture consists of various network functions (NF) and components that  are responsible for securing end-to-end communications, providing authentication functions and  various other security functions. The 5G security architecture consists of components that are  part of various other architectures (‘Zoom-ins’ in terms of this report), acting thus in a horizontal  manner across all other architectures. In particular, security functions are securing the access of  users within the radio access network (RAN), they cover security functions in the core network  and perimeter entities (edge computing) and they provide security functions in the Network  Function Virtualisation (NFV). Finally, a set of elements is covering security management  functions, audit and analytics.  The detailed structure of the 5G security architecture is shown in the following figure:  Figure 10: 5G Security Architecture zoom-in  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  43  The elements of the 5G security architecture are as follows:  Element Short description  Mobile Equipment (ME) ME stands for all kinds of mobile equipment that can be  connected to the 5G network. ME can be sensors, IoT  components, connected autonomous systems, eHealth  devices, etc.  Universal Subscriber  Identity Module (USIM)  USIM is the SIM card of 5G.It is a platform for securing  access and communication in 5G. It is the only security  module mentioned in 3GPP specification.  5G Node Base Station  Central Unit (gNB-CU)  Some security requirements for gNB-CU have been  formulated by 3GPPP. Though not a security element per  se, these requirements increase the security properties of  gNB and – when implemented - are considered to be  relevant to the security architecture.  Non-3GPP Access  Network  Security for non-3GPP access to the 5G Core network is  achieved by a procedure using IKEv2 as defined in RFC  7296 to set up one or more IPsec ESP security  associations. The role of IKE initiator (or client) is taken by  the UE, and the role of IKE responder (or server) is taken  by the N3IW.  Security Anchor Function  (SEAF)  The SEAF will create for the primary authentication a  unified anchor key KSEAF (common for all accesses) that  can be used by the UE and the serving network to protect  the subsequent communication41.  Authentication server  function (AUSF)  The Authentication server function (AUSF) shall handle  authentication requests for both, 3GPP access and non-  3GPP access. The AUSF shall provide SUPI to the VPLMN  only after authentication confirmation if authentication  request with SUCI was sent by VPLMN. The AUSF shall  inform the UDM that a successful or unsuccessful  authentication of a subscriber has occurred.  Authentication credential  Repository and  Processing Function  (ARPF)  ARPF selects an authentication method based on  subscriber identity and configured policy and computes the  authentication data and keying materials  Subscription Identifier De-  concealing Function  (SIDF)  The SIDF is responsible for de-concealment of the  Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) and shall fulfil the  following requirements:  • The SIDF shall be a service offered by UDM.  41  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b 116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  44  • The SIDF shall resolve the SUPI from the SUCI  based on the protection scheme used to generate the  SUCI.  Security Edge Protection  Proxy (SEPP)  The 5G System architecture introduces a Security Edge  Protection Proxy (SEPP) as the entity sitting at the  perimeter of the mobile network. The SEPP shall act as a  non-transparent proxy node.  NFV Security Services  Agent (SSA)  The NFV SSA exists in both the NFVI domain and in VNF  domain. NFV SSA in VNF domain may exist as a separate  VSF, or within a VNF. The NFV SSA is responsible for  securely receiving the Security Monitoring policy and  implementing the same.  NFV Security Controller  (SC)  The NFV SC may interface with other security systems  (e.g. Security Analytics), security databases and other  policy engines. The NFV SC orchestrates system wide  security policies. The NFV SC acts as a trusted 3rd party  that resides independently.  An NFV SC manages NFV SSAs (like VSFs) to keep them  in a consistent state according to the policy specified. SC  also facilitates secure bootstrapping of SSAs (like VSFs),  managing instances of SSAs, secure pairing up with SSA's  VNFMs and EMs, personalize the SSAs, policy  management, integrity assertion, credential management,  facilitate clustering of multiple SSAs into a distributed  appliance, monitoring of SSAs for failure and remediation.  NFV Security Services  Provider (SSP)  The NFV SSP is located within the VIM and VNFM, and is  responsible for security monitoring policy orchestration  received from the Security Controller (NFV SC) and  interacting with the various VIM/VNFM components to  implement the policy across various systems comprising  the NFVI/VNF. Furthermore, NFV SSP is also responsible  for receiving the telemetry data from various NFV SSAs,  and optionally making some analysis based on this data.  NFV Security Monitoring  Database  The NFV SecM-DB is a secure database consisting of  security data used for deploying NFV system wide Security  Monitoring. This includes Security Monitoring policy and  configurations, security credentials for facilitating secure  communications between the various Security Monitoring  components, and credentials for secure storage of  telemetry, including tenant-specific security policies.  SA/VSF Catalog Database  (VSF-NVNF-CAT)  The NFV VSF-VNF-CAT is a repository for Security  Services Agents like the Virtual Security Functions (VSF)  VNFs. The catalogue has capability to add and remove  SSAs (VSF) packages and/or images, and also includes a  VSF VNFD containing meta data and information about  that VSF VNF. Once the SSA (VSF) package or instance is  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  45  added to the catalogue, it becomes available for  orchestration.  Audit DB The NFV AUD-DB is a secure database consisting of  security audit information.  Security Monitoring  Analytics System  The Security Monitoring Analytics system securely receives  Security Monitoring telemetry from across the NFV  systems, including the MANO and all the NFVIs that may  be geographically distributed. The analytics system applies  advanced machine learning techniques on the telemetry to  perform advanced detection of security anomalies and  emerging threats in the system. This system also can  trigger remediation actions through the NFV SC.  Subscription Concealed  Identifier (SUCI)  A one-time use subscription identifier, which contains the  Scheme-Output, and additional non-concealed information  needed for home network routing and protection scheme  usage.  Authentication Vector A vector consisting of RAND, authentication Token (AUTN)  and Hash eXpected RESponse (HXRES).  Anchor Key The security key KSEAF provided during authentication  and used for derivation of subsequent security keys.  Key Hierarchy Hierarchy of cryptographic key derived from Anchor Key.  (as defined in ETSI TS 133 501 section 6.2.) 42 It includes  the following keys: KAUSF, KSEAF, KAMF, KNASint,  KNASenc, KN3IWF, KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint  and KUPenc.  3.11 5G PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (ZOOM-IN)  One of the most important aspects in the transition from previous generations of mobile  telecommunications into 5G is the ‘softwarisation’ of network functions, previously performed by  physical appliances. Furthermore, some of these physical components were mostly proprietary  and incompatible with other solutions. With 5G, the network software can run in any  commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, making MNOs less dependent on manufacturers.  This significant change will allow great scalability, quicker deployments, cost efficiency and  integration between different components of the network. However, the high level of  virtualisation will increase the impact of failures: a shared physical component will serve multiple  functions (e.g. virtual functions, slicing, user equipment functions, etc.), playing thus a significant  role in the service provisioning chain. At the same time this also greatly increases the  complexity of the software implementation, which itself is associated with new threats.  Nonetheless, the physical 5G architecture is going to remain exposed to more generic threats  that are pertinent to physical components, such as: damage/theft, sabotage, natural disasters,  outages, failures and malfunctions, just to name the most important ones. While in previous  42 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133500_133599/133501/15.01.00_60/ts_133501v150100p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  46  mobile networks such failures had a more ‘restricted’ influence in service provisioning, with the  5G virtualisation failures of physical components may have an amplified impact, typical to  shared resources. This fact increases the criticality of 5G physical infrastructure components, as  multiple services are going to depend on them.  The 5G physical infrastructure is depicted in the following figure:  Figure 11: 5G physical architecture zoom-in  The physical architecture shows all hardware components required for:   Enterprise Network (out of scope of this report apart from UE);   Radio Access Network consisting of RAN-CU, C-RAN MEC and mmWave routers;   Transport network (backhaul) consisting of Edge Could, and SDN controller/switches and   Data centre consisting of Central Cloud, MANO and SND controllers.  Note that this architecture does not contain details of some (important) security related  hardware components such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Secure Execution Engines  (SEE), Trusted Execution Engines (TEE), Trusted Platform Module (TPM), etc. These  components are not entirely covered in 5G specifications considered in this report and may be  added in future versions of this report.

Besides being valuable to an organisation, assets may contribute  to the fulfilment of legal obligations,  In a typical ICT system, assets can be:  a) hardware, software and communication components;  b) communication links between them;  c) data that control the function of the system, are produced and/or consumed by it, or  flow within it;  d) the physical and organisational infrastructure within which the 5G system is deployed,  and;  e) the human agents who interact with the system and may affect its operation (e.g.,  users, system administrators etc.).  Due to its value, a digital asset becomes a target for threat agents. Threat agents are human or  software agents, which may wish to abuse, compromise and/or damage assets. Threat agents  may perform attacks, which create threats that pose risks to assets.  In the overview of 5G assets provided in the remainder of this report, we have classified assets  into different categories, described in section 4.2. Furthermore, we have grouped assets  according to their position within the 5G architecture and their exposure.  4.2 ASSET CATEGORIES  5G assets have been derived from the provided architecture, including the details depicted in  the various ‘Zoom-ins’. The asset diagram is structured using asset groups according to their  exposure to threats. By taking into account the role of assets in maintaining the security-related  properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity (known as CIA triad),43,44 an initial  assessment of their importance has been developed. In doing so, the emphasis has been given  to asset groups responsible for maintaining the overall security and availability of the 5G  infrastructure and that are known targets of cyber-attacks.  In the present chapter, we present the various assets categories used for structuring 5G assets,  together with a mapping showing the role of these asset categories for maintaining the CIA  security properties. A detailed asset decomposition diagram with all 5G assets considered in  this threat landscape can be found in Annex A.  The asset categories are shown in Figure 12 and their content is as follows:  Policy: Policy Control Functions (PCF) are performing provisioning, management of sessions  related to consumer functions. These functions can be used for charging control (e.g. usage  and charging), policy control and application detection control.45 The functions are applied to  43 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security, accessed September 2019.  44 https://geek-university.com/ccna-security/confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-cia-triad/, accessed September 2019.  45 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/129500_129599/129512/15.01.00_60/ts_129512v150100p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security https://geek-university.com/ccna-security/confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-cia-triad/ https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_TS/129500_129599/129512/15.01.00_60/ts_129512v150100p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  48  data flow detection, gating, Quality of Service traffic screening, etc. Given their role in the  management of policy issues related to consumers, these functions may be targeted in order to  influence monetary matters (charging) of 5G network usage.  Management processes: This asset group summarizes important processes assigned to  development, deployment and operation of the entire set of components of the 5G  infrastructure. They include configuration, network management, software development  process, continuity, key and access rights management, etc. it seems that these processes will  play a significant role in guaranteeing security and trust in 5G operations, and in component  development in particular.46,47 Some certifications based on process-level assurance schemes  for 5G have been already announced.48  Business applications: Similar to previous generation mobile networks, these assets are  representing commissioning and customer relationship management that are necessary in order  to implement business-related matters within the 5G Network (referred to as Operational  Support Systems – OSS and Business Support Systems – BSS). Such functions will be  implemented through policy control functions. Being a vital part of customer maintenance and  billing purposes, the assets in this category are exposed to manipulation (integrity) attacks.  Confidentiality of subscriber information might also be targeted by attacks.  Business services: In a 5G context, this asset group refers to the components required to  deliver a specific service that is monetized by a provider and/or MNO. An example is the  delivery of horizontal, business, government, critical and emergency services.  Protocols: This asset group represents (main) communication protocols used within the 5G  infrastructure. It covers protocols that are used in network communications, radio  communications and security. Knowingly, protocols are common attack points with a series of  threats, such as reconnaissance, eavesdropping, SYN flood, replay and man-in-the-middle  attacks.  Data network: This asset group represents the connectivity to external data, content, services  and other resources available outside the 5G network. The data network is also used to  interconnect different 5G networks, operators and providers.  Slicing: This asset group represents all 5G functions that are responsible for the creation and  management of slicing. Slices are virtualised independent logical networks that carry out the  network communication between the user equipment and 5G services. Slices are end-to-end  network communication links that are virtually multiplexed and mapped to resources of the  virtualised physical network platform. While 4G allowed for APN (Access Point Name), in 5G  slicing is taking place initially on a static base and later on a dynamic basis. Slicing is  considered as one of the main advantages of 5G networks enabling low network latency.  Data: With this asset group, the entire data household for the operation of 5G are covered,  notably confidential and/or security-related 5G data. Though not necessarily exhaustive at this  stage of the analysis, this asset group covers information related to: user data, system and  configuration data, security-related data, network data (configuration, edge, logs, API-data,  SDN-data, etc.). It is expected that 5G data such as user, security and configuration information  46 https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/1569-secam_for_3gpp_nodes, accessed September 2019.  47 https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/, accessed September 2019.  48 https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FS.14-NESAS-Security-Test-Laboratory- Accreditation-Pilot-Release_0.7.pdf, accessed September 2019.  https://www.3gpp.org/news-events/1569-secam_for_3gpp_nodes https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/ https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FS.14-NESAS-Security-Test-Laboratory-Accreditation-Pilot-Release_0.7.pdf https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FS.14-NESAS-Security-Test-Laboratory-Accreditation-Pilot-Release_0.7.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  49  will be subject to cyber-attacks with the aim to breach them. Main motives are monetization and  unnoticed access to the network.  Human assets: Considered as one of the most important asset groups, human assets  represent all individuals involved in the operation and use of the 5G network. Under this asset  category, we include operator’s staff (including tenants and security operators), 3rd party  personnel and end-users. Of particular importance are operator and 3rd party data that are  related to administration credentials. Members of this asset group may be involved in insider  threat, information leakage and unintentional damages through errors.  Time: Time is an important asset group within 5G networks. It plays a significant role in many  time-dependent functions (e.g. quality of service, network management, virtualisation  management, etc.). The most critical interplay between time and network functions concerns  security functions (such as key management, encryption and timestamps). Time inaccuracies  may lead to failures and manipulations that can have far-reaching consequences to the  availability of network functions. It is worth mentioning that the reduction of time inaccuracies in  5G has not yet been fully addressed in the current specifications and 5G virtualisation practices.  Legal: Assets of this category are related to various contractual agreements and Intellectual  Property Rights (IPRs), that are either subject to bilateral of service provisioning among various  5G stakeholders or are related to IPR rights of the used services and components. Several  cyber-threats, especially the ones that may lead to service unavailability and/or degradation  may significantly affect these assets. Such an impact will have legal and monetary  consequences for the party failing to provide their agreed services.  Legacy: This asset group encompasses all legacy systems connected to the 5G network or  used within migration paths (e.g. from 2G to 5G). This asset group includes physical network  functions (PNFs), service gateways, management entities, packet gateways, legacy protocols,  legacy encryption infrastructure, etc. This asset group is exposed to unintentional damage  threats and such that are concerned with the management of phased-out components (e.g.  software and configuration maintenance).  Data storage/repository: This asset encompasses all assets (mainly network functions) that  implement the persistence of and access to the stored 5G data. Though not fully exhaustive at  this stage of the analysis, it covers the unified data repository function (UDF) and the storage  functions for security-related information (catalogue database, security monitoring database and  audit database). Due to its importance for the entire system security, this asset group may be  subject to attacks aiming at compromising sensitive system information.  Physical infrastructure: This asset group includes all physical assets of 5G, mainly IT  components, cabling and data centres and user equipment. More precisely, assets grouped in  this category are network hardware, cloud and operator data centres, user equipment of all  kinds, and radio access hardware. Despite the virtualised structure of the 5G network and all  involved network functions, there will be a strong dependency on the physical infrastructure,  especially in the initial migration/hybrid 5G deployments. Moreover, to deliver the required  security services, some cryptographic hardware components at the data centre will play a  critical role, while at the same time being potential points of failure. The entire physical  infrastructure can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter (see  chapter 3.11).  Management and orchestration (MANO): This asset group stands for the entire set of assets  related to management and orchestration. MANO is considered to be the most critical part of the  5G infrastructure as it is responsible for managing the entire set of network functions, their  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  50  virtualisation and entire software life-cycle related hereto. The main parts of MANO are the  Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) orchestrator, the Virtual Network Function (VNF)  manager, and the virtualised infrastructure manager. Given its important role, MANO is going to  be exposed to numerous attacks with potentially major impact on the entire managed 5G  infrastructure environment. The assets of MANO are also depicted in detail in the corresponding  ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter (see chapter 3.5).  Radio Access Network (RAN): This asset group represents the logical components making up  the functions of the Radio Access Network (RAN hardware is not part of this asset group). It  includes mainly distribution unit and control unit of radio access. The RAN components and  their interconnections can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture  chapter (see chapter 3.6).  Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV): This asset group contains all network functions that  are virtualised to depart from proprietary dedicated hardware. NFV is a 5G specific architecture  that virtualises classes of network node functions and physical network functions (PNF) into  blocks that take over the entire connectivity actions necessary for communication services. This  asset group also includes all security functions, that is, functions that cope will all the required  authentication, monitoring and subscription. Security functions are considered particularly  sensitive, as they use key material to perform operations. As such, they will be exposed to  attacks aiming at breaching this information and compromise the entire security part of the 5G  network. The entire NFV structure can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G  architecture chapter (see chapter 3.7).  Software Defined Networks (SDN): This group contains the assets related to the SDN network  controller, virtual network switches, data plane, application plane and control plane. Detailed  information about SDN assets can be found in a previous ENISA thematic threat landscape  covering SDN38. The contents of this report are still valid and can be used to obtain information  about threat exposure and threat mitigation w.r.t. these assets. Due to its importance for 5G,  SDN is considered within this document for completeness purposes. Due to its important role for  the setup and management of the entire virtualised 5G network, SDN is regarded as a key  component for the availability and integrity of network functions. The entire SDN architecture  can be found in the corresponding ‘Zoom-in’ in the 5G architecture chapter (see chapter 3.8).  References to SDN functions used from within other parts of the 5G architecture are shown in  the various other ‘Zoom ins’ (e.g. NFV ‘Zoom-in’).  Lawful Interception (LI): Lawful Interception assets are concerned with the 5G functions  implementing all provisions for performing lawful surveillance, providing thus legally sanctioned  access to 5G private communications of all kinds. Interested readers can find detailed  information on 5G LI provisions in this document.49,50 Though not analysed much further in this  document, these functions deserve special attention as they do provide any information  processed in 5G networks. As such, LI (related functions and data) is a target for manipulations  and other malicious actions (e.g. unlawful surveillance, weaponisation of interception,  manipulation of information, etc.).  Transport: Transport assets represent all communication channels used for network transfer.  This asset group includes satellite communication, fibre optics communication, micro-waves  communication, Ethernet, as well as wireless and Near Field Communication (NFC). These  assets are crucial for the availability of communication. However, with the virtualisation of the  49 http://statewatch.org/news/2019/jun/eu-council-ctc-5g-law-enforcement-8983-19.pdf, accessed September 2019.  50 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf, accessed September  2019.  http://statewatch.org/news/2019/jun/eu-council-ctc-5g-law-enforcement-8983-19.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  51  network architecture, transport becomes less important compared with previous generations of  mobile communications.  Virtualisation: The role of virtualisation functions in 5G is crucial. With this asset group, we  summarise assets that are related to virtual machine technologies and the hypervisor. Due to  the massive virtualisation in 5G, these two components are decisive for the functionality of the  entire network. Given the trend of using common open-source software for these two  components, new vulnerabilities, when exploited, will multiply attack impact in the underlying  technology platform. It is expected that hypervisors will be subject to attacks. With the ability to  access and manage computer memory, attackers may access cryptographic material in case of  operations performed in this memory (i.e. absence of dedicated crypto-hardware).  Cloud: Cloud technology will be extensively used within the 5G architecture, either through the  provisioning of SaaS or IaaS. In the asset diagram, this group contains the logical cloud  services. The hardware part related to cloud is covered in the physical infrastructure asset  group. Cloud will be used as a platform by tenants to control storage and processing resources.  Existing threats targeting cloud, when materialized, may unveil multiple confidential information,  while at the same time affecting the availability of the entire 5G infrastructure.  Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC): This group consists of assets related to the  decentralisation of cloud functions (storage of data and computing) located closer to the user or  edge device. This group is further decomposed within this document using a specialised ‘Zoom-  in’ of the 5G architecture (see chapter 3.9). This material can be used to decompose this asset  group further.  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are  of great importance to the 5G ecosystem as they enable the exposure of functionalities across  different networks. It allows applications and services to program network functions, to  interconnect various networks and operators. 5G is also responsible for the introduction of  REST API concept into telecommunications systems. REST,51 which stands for  Representational State Transfer is a set of constraints that, when applied to the design of a  system, creates a software architectural style. The exposure of functionalities is a common  concept used by modern software design, especially for web-services which are offered over  the internet. REST APIs are defined along with a number of common principles which are  referred to as REST architectural style.  Security Controls: This asset group contains some of the security controls that are relevant for  communication networks in general and 5G in particular. They include, but are not limited to:  incident management, DoS protection, intrusion prevention, intrusion detection, firewalling,  network traffic analysis and security edge protection proxy. As these controls are key for the  security of the network, they are considered as exposed to a variety of cyberthreats and are  expected to be targets of attacks. Knowing that the mentioned controls are far from being  exhaustive, they are a first attempt to enlist basic 5G security measures, also referenced within  various specifications/5G architectures. Although they could be considered as security controls  too, this asset group does not contain parts of the 5G security architecture, which are subsumed  under network functions. The 5G security architecture was also depicted in a ‘Zoom-in’ (see  chapter 3.10). In future versions of the 5G threat landscape, this asset group will be amended  with additional assets (i.e. mitigation measures). This amendment will follow ongoing work in  standardisation committees upon publication and will be subject to future versions of the 5G  threat landscape.  51 https://www.riverpublishers.com/journal/journal_articles/RP_Journal_2245-800X_617.pdf, accessed August 2019.  https://www.riverpublishers.com/journal/journal_articles/RP_Journal_2245-800X_617.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  52  Figure 13: Used 5G asset categories  In the following table, we provide the relevance of the identified asset groups with regard to the  CIA triad.

We  recommend performance of this exercise in higher detail, depending on the focus of prospective  threat assessments. In this case, to achieve a more precise mapping, users of this document  should obtain a more accurate internal evaluation of these properties.  Concluding this chapter, it is worth mentioning that due to its complexity and the early stage of 5G  networks (development, deployment, specification) the asset mapping is an ongoing task that will  need some time to reach a mature stage. This is due to a variety of reasons/issues regarding the  parameters of current 5G activities (narrow time windows for the creation of reports, resource  issues, knowledge transfer, vendor’s enrolment, etc.). These challenges will be sufficiently  managed in future assessment of 5G threats.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  54  5. 5G THREATS  5G introduces significant innovation to mobile networks by integrating multiple and different  types of technologies. While these are unquestionable benefits, the risks and threats are yet to  be fully unserstood. The complexity and extension of the attack surface – as described in  section 4.2 and presented in Annex A - makes the activity of accurately defining the 5G threat  landscape a laborious task. The 5G threat landscape combines traditional IP-based threats with  the all-5G network (core, access and edge), insecure legacy 2/3/4G generations and threats  introduced by virtualisation technology.  5.1 TAXONOMY OF THREATS  The list below presents a list of high-level categorization of threats based on ENISA threat  taxonomy.   Nefarious activity/abuse (NAA): This threat category is defined as “intended actions  that target ICT systems, infrastructure, and networks by means of malicious acts with  the aim to either steal, alter, or destroy a specified target”.   Eavesdropping/Interception/ Hijacking (EIH): This threat category is defined as  “actions aiming to listen, interrupt, or seize control of a third party communication  without consent”.   Physical attacks (PA): This threat category is defined as “actions which aim to  destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to physical assets  such as infrastructure, hardware, or interconnection”.   Damage (DAM): This threat category is defined as intentional actions aimed at  causing “ destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a failure or  reduction in usefulness”.   Unintentional Damage (UD): This threat category is defined as unintentional actions  aimed at causing “destruction, harm, or injury of property or persons and results in a  failure or reduction in usefulness”.   Failures or malfunctions (FM): This threat category is defined as “Partial or full  insufficient functioning of an asset (hardware or software)”.   Outages (OUT): This threat category is defined as “unexpected disruptions of service  or decrease in quality falling below a required level“.   Disaster (DIS): This threat category is defined as “a sudden accident or a natural  catastrophe that causes great damage or loss of life”.   Legal (LEG): This threat category is defined as “legal actions of third parties  (contracting or otherwise), in order to prohibit actions or compensate for loss based on  applicable law”.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  55  In addition to the above general taxonomy, we also categorise threats depending on whether  the exploitation target is part of core network, radio access, network virtualisation or generic  infrastructure component. Based on this criterion, threats can be further categorised into:   Core Network threats: These threats relate to elements of the Core Network that  includes SDN, NVF, NS and MANO. The majority fall under the categories of  ‘Nefarious activity/abuse’ and ‘Eavesdropping/ Interception/ Hijacking’. 5G Core  Network threats are described in detail in section 5.2.   Access network threats: These threats relate to the 5G radio access technology  (RAT), radio access network (RAN) and non-3GPP access technologies. These  include threats related to the wireless medium and radio transmission technology. The  majority of the threats fall under the categories of ‘Eavesdropping/Interception/  Hijacking’. Access network threats are described in more detail in section 5.3.   Multi-edge computing threats: These threats relate to components located at the  edge of the network. The majority fall under the categories of ‘Nefarious activity/abuse’  and ‘Eavesdropping/ Interception/ Hijacking’. 5G Multi Edge Computing threats are  described in detail in section 5.4.   Virtualisation threats: These are threats related to the virtualisation of the underlying  IT infrastructure, network and functions. Virtualisation threats are described in more  detail in section 5.5.   Physical Infrastructure threats: These are threats related to the underlying IT  infrastructure that supports the network. The majority fall under the categories of  ‘Physical attacks’, ‘Damage or loss of equipment’, ‘Equipment failures or malfunctions’,  ‘Outages’, ‘Disaster’. Physical infrastructure threats are described in more detail in  section 5.6.   Generic threats: These are threats that typically affect any ICT system or network.  The generic threats are important to mention since these help defining and framing the  ones specific to 5G. As an example: many 5G specific threats may result in a network  service shutdown that in general terms is defined as a Denial of Service (DoS) threat.  The Generic threats are described in more detail in section 5.7.   SDN threats: These are threats related to the SDN functions that are omnipresent in  the entire 5G infrastructure. For this document, we build on the threats identified in the  ENISA Thematic Landscape SDN/5G.  5.2 CORE NETWORK THREATS  Abuse of remote access: This threat consists of a malicious actor having remote access to  critical network components and take control of a virtual machine to perform other types of  attacks. Remote access is a standard practice within the tech industry, to facilitate maintenance  and operational procedures performed in clients. By gaining illegal access to the remote access  function, a malicious actor can connect to operating systems and applications, in a critical  domain of the network. With access to a machine in the network, a malicious actor can engage  in other activities such as tampering configuration data and distribution of malware.  Authentication traffic spikes: This threat relates to a massive number of authentication  requests sent by a malicious actor in a short time. A malicious actor initiates traffic spikes or  emphasizes the effects of natural traffic spikes with IoT devices aiming to connect.  Consequently, the network will experience more signalling and authentication requests that is  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  56  capable of handling. This kind of attack may be considered as a special case of denial of  (authentication) service. Potentially, the authentication of authorized devices may fail resulting in  the loss of connectivity.53  Abuse of user authentication/authorization data. This threat relates to the disclosure of long-  term keys for authentication and security controls conducted by an insider or hostile or  untrustworthy personnel operating in the Core Network.  Abuse of third party hosted network functions: This threat relates to availability issues and  disclosure of sensitive data due to core network functions hosted on third-party cloud service  providers’ systems. An untrustworthy cloud service provider could access, interrupt and modify  user/control plane traffic traversing its premises on behalf of the MNO.  Abuse of lawful interception function: This threat relates to the abusive use of the lawful  interception function (based on the law) performed by a network operator/access  provider/service provider (NWO/AP/SvP), making available certain information to a law  enforcement monitoring facility. This threat also considers the unauthorised access to this  function when hosted outside the operator’s network. If a vendor/supplier has access to the  mobile network then it will be possible for him to manipulate this function and bypass the audit  mechanisms in a way that the abuse is not detected by the MNO.  Application programming interface (API) exploitation: This threat involves exploiting  application programming interfaces (APIs) to launch different types of attacks. Much of the  openness and programmability offered by the new 5G network architecture relies on the  expanded use of APIs. The exploitation can target different types of API naming internal  network functions, internetworking interfaces, roaming interfaces, etc. exposed in different  layers of the network. A poorly designed or configured API with inaccurate access control rules  may expose core network functions and sensitive parameters. It is important to highlight that 5G  infrastructure will rely on COTS solutions that extensively use open source APIs. The level of  quality and scrutiny imposed in the development and implementation of proprietary solutions  should also apply for COTS and open source components. The threat of having one small  compromised API in the 5G core may place the entire network at risk.  Exploitation of poorly designed architecture and planning (network, services and  security): Classified as unintentional damage - Inadequate design, planning or improper  adaptation – this threat relates to issues arising from the multiple options and features that this  technology has to offer from its original inception to implementation. The level of complexity and  the difficulty to reach an optimal architecture, adequate security and operating procedures may  lead to poor design and implementation. Design flaws are opportunities for malicious actors to  exploit. By knowing that a particular feature that is not adequately implemented or protected, a  malicious actor can exploit the breach and inject malware in the core network.  Exploitation of misconfigured or poorly configured systems/networks: Often identified as  a vulnerability, it’s the exploitation of misconfigured or poorly configured systems that qualifies  as a threat. The exploitation of a misconfigured system that in essence is from an unintentional  nature, creates the opportunity for a threat actor to reach critical assets in the network or stage  an attack. Configuration flaws may happen at different stages of the solution implementation  life-cycle such as product installation and maintenance. Examples include poorly configured  APIs, network functions, access control rules, network slices, administration rights, virtualised  environments, traffic isolation, edge nodes, orchestration software, firewalls, etc. It is worth  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  57  stating that this threat has consistently been a major cause of incidents reported to ENISA in the  Article 13a security breach notification process52.  Erroneous use or administration of the network, systems and devices: Classified as  unintentional damage (erroneous administration of devices and systems) the errors resulting  from a poorly maintained and administrated network may compromise the confidentially,  integrity and availability of the network. An example of actions associated with a poorly  administered system includes the lack of operational processes and procedures that could  expose the network to an attack.  Fraud scenarios related to roaming interconnections: In a roaming scenario, the visited  network needs to obtain authentication vectors from user’s home network, that could abusively  authenticate the user thus giving him access to serving MNO resources.53  Lateral movement: Classified as nefarious activity/abuse of assets, lateral movement is often  adopted by threat agents to gain position in different components of the core network. Once a  threat actor gains position, obtains enough time to perform reconnaissance activities to find  weaknesses in the network. The threat of lateral movement is of a great concern due to the  complex nature of and diversity of technologies used in a 5G Network. This fact allows threat  actor to operate undetected for longer periods and fine-tune an attack.  Memory scraping: This threat arises when an attacker scans the physical memory of a  software component in order to extract sensitive information that it is not authorised to have.  While memory scraping can affect components of any layer of the network, this type of threat  has been primarily identified for SDN application servers. While memory scraping threat may  target different components of the core network, a core dump of an SDN controller (e.g. as the  result of malicious software) can be used to exploit private data. Furthermore, SDN  reconfiguration may require reboots that an attacker could use in order to attack the boot  procedure. Once successfully performed, memory scraping can be used to extract sensitive  SDN data (e.g. flow rules at the northbound API).  Manipulation of network traffic, network reconnaissance and information gathering: The  threat includes the modification or falsification of data in transit (messages), injection of  illegitimate data into the network, whether by replaying previous messages or by forging new  messages, the use of traffic spikes and rerouting, modification of flow priorities.  Manipulation of network configuration data: Inadequate policies in the management and  protection of critical configuration data may lead to unpredictable system behaviour and  unauthorised access to critical platforms, with impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the  network. This threat involves compromising a core network element (e.g. SDN controller,  network function, management and orchestration function) by forging configuration data to  launch other attacks (e.g. DoS). While configuration data forging may, in principle, relate to data  held by any component of the network, this threat refers specifically to configuration and/or  control plane data. Examples of configuration data manipulation are listed below.   Routing tables manipulation   Falsification of configuration data   DNS manipulation  Malicious flooding of core network components: This threat involves flooding a network  component with requests or traffic, compromising its availability. Flooding may occur during the  52 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos, accessed September 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  58  transmission of data, exhausting component resources and leading to a reduction or complete  shutdown of the service provided by the component. This threat also considers other techniques  such as amplification and saturation described below.  Amplification and flooding attacks take place in specific SDN components whereby a small  stream of requests from a faked sender elicits a massive flood of responses. While protection  from such attacks has been devised for many known network protocols, the exposure of several  network functions (NFV) by SDN controllers presents a completely new landscape of threats.  Flooding attacks may come in the flavour of distributed DoS attacks, where a vast number of  sources may be orchestrated to generate the message floods. These sources could, for  example, be the members of a botnet, e.g. a collection of devices infected with malware to the  point that they can all be controlled by an attacker to execute the attack. Flooding attacks may  affect all kinds of external interfaces the network provides, including the radio interface,  interfaces to external networks like the internet or other mobile networks.  Malicious diversion of traffic: This threat involves compromising a network element to divert  traffic flows and allow a malicious actor to eavesdrop on network traffic. Traffic diversion is a  threat relating to network elements of the data plane. A specific kind of traffic diversion that is  available in virtualised networks is the network slice trespassing. This threat may occur when  the mandatory isolation between slices is compromised in any active node or when the  enforcing access to a slice in the edge equipment is either bypassed or misconfigured.  Manipulation of the network resources orchestrator: The threat considers the manipulation  of the network resources orchestrator configuration to perform an attack. This threat includes  modifying a network function behaviour by altering the settings in the orchestrator (E2E service  inventory, service programmability) and consequently compromising the separation between  network functions.  Misuse of audit tools: This threat is classified under nefarious activities/abuse of assets. Audit  tools are used by MNOs to monitor the activity of the network and obtain information that can be  used for multiple purposes such as optimisation, security, commercial, etc. This type of software  tools retain information about the network and its users and provide an advantage to malicious  actors to perform recognisance activities for an attack. A malicious actor typically uses insiders  to the MNO with privileged access to these tools to extract sensitive information.  Opportunistic and fraudulent usages of shared resources. This threat relates to  unauthorised access and/or modification of 5G connected devices critical data. End-to-end keys  may be stolen or leaked from the centralized key servers. As a consequence, the end-to-end  secured communication is vulnerable for different attacks and adversaries gain an access to the  end-points. The root cause is the leaking of authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)  credentials from the MNO’s employee network.53  Registration of malicious network functions. This threat is classified as nefarious activities or  abuse of assets (NAA). An unauthorised network function (NF) or function embedding a Trojan,  - introduced in the network by an insider (to the MNO) or a vendor/service provider - could be  abusively installed in the service base architecture (SBA) and registered in the core network via  NRF, in order to expose other malicious APIs. By having an unauthorized network function  installed or activated, a malicious actor may have access to sensitive assets in the network to  53 https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/5G-PPP_White-Paper_Phase-1-Security-Landscape_June-2017.pdf,  accessed September 2019  https://5g-ppp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/5G-PPP_White-Paper_Phase-1-Security-Landscape_June-2017.pdf  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  59  perform other type of attacks such as DoS, distribution of malicious software, stealing sensitive  information, etc.  Traffic sniffing: Sniffing is a popular method used by malicious actors to capture and analyse  network communication information. With sniffing, a malicious actor is also able to eavesdrop  data from network elements or links and steal valuable information. Sniffing can happen  anywhere where there is constant traffic. In SDN for example, a malicious actor can take  advantage of unencrypted communications to intercept traffic from and to a central controller.  The data captured could include critical information on flows or traffic allowed on the network.  Side-channel attacks: This threat involves extracting information on existing flow rules used by  network elements. The threat can be realised by exploiting patterns of network operations (e.g.  exploiting the time required for establishing a network connection). Side-channel attacks are a  threat relating to network elements of the data plane.  5.3 ACCESS NETWORK THREATS  Abuse of spectrum resources: The illegal use of these resources, due to the dynamic  allocation/ reallocation of the same, may allow the occupation of specific idle spectrum band by  imitating the characteristics of a legitimately licensed unit and causing interference in radio  frequencies. This illicit occupation of the spectrum may also induce a network node to reject  spectrum resources requested by unlicensed units - due to the apparent lack of idle resources –  thus blocking someone out of the core network.  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning: This kind of attack is also called ARP cache  spoofing: a technique by which an attacker sends spoofed ARP messages onto the network.  Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another  host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the  attacker instead.  Fake access network node: Classified as a nefarious activity, this threat considers the  compromise of a base station (gnB) by masquerading as legitimate, facilitating different types of  attacks such as man-in-the-middle or network traffic manipulation. The threat considers  tampering the communication between the mobile user equipment (UE) and the network to  initiate other malicious actions.  Flooding attack: This threat involves flooding radio interfaces with requests. Flooding occurs  through the transmission of data that can exhaust component resources and lead to a reduction  or complete shutdown of the radio frequency provided by the component.  IMSI catching attacks: This threat relates to cellular paging protocols that can be exploited by  a malicious actor in the vicinity of a victim to associate the victim's soft-identity (e.g., phone  number, Twitter handle) with its paging occasion. Through an attack dubbed  ‘$mathsf{ToRPEDO}$’  a malicious actor can verify a victim's coarse-grained location  information, inject fabricated paging messages, and mount denial-of-service attacks.  Jamming the radio frequency: Classified as a nefarious activity/abuse of asset, this threat  refers to an intentional disruption/interference of the network radio frequency (NRF) causing the  core network (and related services) to become unreachable for affected users. The threat also  refers to the unavailability of the transport layer when using radio-based networks and  interference with the geo-positioning system (GPS).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  60  MAC spoofing: MAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access  Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The MAC address that is  hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed. However, many drivers  allow the MAC address to be changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an  operating system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing. The process  of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing. Essentially, MAC spoofing entails  changing a computer's identity to conduct an attack.  Manipulation of access network configuration data: This threat involves compromising an  access network element (e.g. base stations) to forge configuration data and launch other  attacks (e.g. DoS).  Radio interference: A threat in which the perpetrator seeks to make a network resource  unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely interfering or disrupting the Radio  Access Network service. The introduction of compromised 5G devices in a radio access  network will present a more substantial DoS threat.  Radio traffic manipulation: This threat considers the manipulation of network traffic at the  base station level. A man-in-the-middle attack can be launched based on a rogue base station  when malicious actor masquerades its Base Transceiver Station (BTS) as a real network’s BTS.  This threat is still considered valid due to backwards compatibility to previous generations of  mobile technology. Other associated threats follow:   Traffic redirecting  Session hijacking: This threat is classified as nefarious activity or abuse of asset and relates  to attacks to open-air interfaces. The threat considers the theft of legitimate authenticated  conversation session ID by a malicious actor, to control the whole session of specific traffic to  conduct other types of attacks.  Signalling fraud: One of the areas of concern is the international signalling interconnection  between networks which may be misused for fraud (e.g., false charging). Another example is  the threat of greedy mobile nodes that transmit fake incumbent signals and force all other users  to vacate a specific band (spectrum hole) to acquire its exclusive use.  Signalling storms: Mobile networks are subject to ‘signalling storms’ launched by malware or  apps, which overload the bandwidth at the cell, the backbone signalling servers, and Cloud  servers, and may also deplete the battery power of mobile devices. Signalling storms will be  more challenging due to the excessive connectivity of UEs, small base stations, and high user  mobility.  5.4 MULTI EDGE COMPUTING THREATS  False or rogue MEC gateway: The open nature of edge gateways, where even user-owned  devices can become full-fledged participants (e.g. personal cloudlets, TV smart-box, etc.),  creates a scenario where malicious actors can deploy their own gateway devices. This  particular threat produces the same outcome as the Man-in-the-Middle attack.  Edge node overload. This threat relates to attacks against edge networks disrupting the vicinity  of the affected networks, at a local or service-specific level. The overload may take place by  flooding the edge node with request or traffic directed to this component, initiated by a specific  mobile app or IoT device.  Abuse of edge open application programming interfaces (APIs): The abuse of open APIs in  Multi Edge Computing nodes is done through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in MEC type of  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  61  applications. The need for open APIs in MEC is mainly to provide support for federated services  and interactions with different providers and content creators. This threat can be associated with  DoS, man-in-the-middle, malicious mode problems, privacy leakages, and VM manipulation.  5.5 VIRTUALISATION THREATS  Abuse on Data Centers Interconnect (DCI) protocol: Virtualised systems are deployed within  data centers, hence, security threats of Data Centers should be considered. This threat relates  to the exploitation of specific vulnerabilities of Data Centers Interconnect (DCI) protocols (e.g.  lack of authentication and encryption). An attacker could create spoofed traffic in such a way  that it traverses DCI links or to create a DoS attack of DCI connections.  Abuse of cloud computational resources: The abuse of powerful computing infrastructure,  including both software and hardware components, could be easily achieved using a simple  registration process in a cloud computing service provider. By taking advantage of the prevailing  computing power of cloud networks, hackers can fire attacks in a very short time. For example,  brute force attacks and DoS attacks can be launched by abusing the power of cloud computing.  Network virtualisation bypassing: Issues related to bad network slicing implementation and  configuration or improper isolation can cause loss of data confidentiality/privacy (Data/traffic  intercepted by entities of other slices). A network used by different tenants needs to assure that  only legitimate traffic enters or leaves a network slice, but also that any switching element  checks and enforces the traffic isolation by installing legitimate flow rules preventing slice  trespassing. At core network level, the hostile actor would exploit hypervisor vulnerabilities and  flow rules configuration to trespass slice isolation and disclose data belonging to other tenants.  Virtualised host abuse: This threat relates to applications running on virtualised hosts, abusing  from shared resources from a virtualised environment. In virtual environments, where physical  resources are shared between tenants, there may be a set of behaviours that result in the  disclosure of sensitive information. For instance, exposure via scavenging in virtualised  environments is even more serious than in physical systems. While interception is a common  threat in physical systems (e.g., networking environments), its effect is further exacerbated in  virtual environments because it permits cross-inspection of various tenant’s data flow, as well as  topology inference that could serve to set up a DoS attack.  5.6 PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THREATS  Manipulation of hardware equipment: This threat considers the inclusion of concealed  hardware or software in the product by a vendor or supplier. This threat may occur at an initial  stage of the product implementation or during maintenance with the application of uncontrolled  updates and new features.  Natural disasters affecting the network infrastructure: Classified as natural or  environmental disaster, this threat refers to natural events such as fires, floods and earthquakes  that can affect 5G network equipment and therefore, the availability of the service at a local and  regional level. Specific types of assets are more exposed to natural disasters such as radio  access equipment (e.g. base stations) and network transport due to its installation on an  outdoor environment.  Physical sabotage/vandalism of the network infrastructure: Classified as a deliberate  physical attack, this threat relates to actions taken by actors aimed at destroying, disabling or  stealing physical assets supporting the 5G Network. A physical attack to 5G critical assets may  disrupt, interfere and ultimately cause unavailability of the network service. Despite the  existence of physical protection mechanisms (e.g., physical surveillance and surveillance  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  62  cameras, security locks, security guards), physical breaches and insider threat attacks may still  occur.  Threat from third parties’ personnel accessing MNO’s facilities. This threat consider the  physical access to facilities and network physical infrastructure by third-party personnel, to  perform maintenance activities and provide technical support. Hostile and untrustworthy  operators could affect the security requirements of the network.  UICC format exploitation. New UICC formats could lead to new kind of vulnerabilities that may  be exploited for data exfiltration, fraud or DoS purposes. Different types of new UICC  components (like eUICC, iUICC, soft SIM, etc.) require new management protocols for the  provisioning of user-profiles and their life cycle. These protocols can be exploited to create DoS  toward the user or for fraud scenarios, including user impersonification.  User equipment compromising: New formats of user equipment, including low-cost insecure  IoT devices, could introduce new kind of vulnerabilities, which may be exploited to target user  data confidentiality and integrity. Abuses on hardware and software implementation on UE side  to install malicious components may compromise confidentiality and integrity of subscriber  profile data.  5.7 GENERIC THREATS  Denial of Service (DoS): DoS is a threat categorised under Nefarious Activity and Abuse of  Asset (NAA), in which the perpetrator seeks to make a network resource unavailable to its  intended users by temporarily or indefinitely interfering or disrupting the network service. The  attack comprises the generation of a massive number of requests or with traffic in a way that the  network becomes partly or completely unavailable for regular users. Multiple types of threats  may lead to a denial of service such as flooding, amplification, signalling storm and saturation  attacks. An attack combining multiple vectors may lead to a distributed DoS (DDoS) attack.  Data breach, leak, theft destruction and manipulation of information: This includes, but not  limited to, the theft of personal information through unauthorised access to the systems and/or  network, unauthorised access to and possible publication of personal identifiable  information/biometric/medical (privacy breach), company confidential information (intellectual  property, commercial and financial data) or government/state-related information (classified  information). The theft, breach or leak of other types of data such as user credentials,  encryption keys, network security logs, software configuration, etc. may also help malicious  actor conducting different types of attacks.  Eavesdropping: Classified as Nefarious Activity and Abuse of Asset (NAA), eavesdropping is a  threat in which the perpetrator seeks to tamper the application and communication layers from  the various 5G network elements (SDN controller, network function, edge node, virtualisation  orchestrator). It includes the eavesdropping on subscriber’ data, confidential information, system  time, subscriber location, electronic messages, signal of data relayed over the network. The  threat actor monitors, spies and/or eavesdrop Nation-State citizens and/or organisations to track  the location or access sensitive information.  Exploitation of software and hardware vulnerabilities: This type of threat enables a  malicious actor to take advantage of unknown (to the vendor and user) or unpatched software  or hardware flaws to perform an attack. Example include the exploitation of known hardware  and software flaws such as meltdown, spectre and buffer overflow. It also includes the  exploitation of other known vulnerabilities related to previous generations of mobile  telecommunications and older signalling protocols such as SS7 (Signalling System 7) and  Diameter.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  63  Malicious code or software: The threat includes the installation and distribution of malicious  software or the implant of specific code or software inside a product or updates. Examples of  malicious software include malware, ransomware, virus, worms, trojans, SQL injections, rogue  security software, rogueware and careware. An example of a malicious software in the 5G  context considers the use of an unauthorised VNF that could abusively install and register itself  into the core network in order to expose malicious APIs.  Compromised supply chain, vendor and service providers: This threat considers the  intentional insertion by a vendor into the product of concealed hardware, malicious software and  software flaws. It also considers the implementation of uncontrolled software updates,  manipulation of functionalities, inclusion of functions to bypass audit mechanisms, backdoors,  undocumented testing features left in the production version, among others.  This threat also relates to activities performed by untrustworthy third parties’ personnel during  product testing, maintenance, configuration and operation. Third parties’ personnel have access  to the network management facilities (both locally and via remote interface) in order to perform  maintenance activities and provide technical support. This privileged access to the operation,  administration and management (OAM) of the network provides an advantage to untrustworthy  third parties’ personnel to access various type of data such as (subscriber’s, system and  network configuration, telemetry data).  Targeted threats: Highly sophisticated attacks or advanced persistence threats may target  sensitive information, e.g. state secrets, industrial secrets or intellectual property, or the  availability of sensitive and critical services.  Exploiting flaws in security, management and operational procedures: Not directly  related with 5G, this threat will become relevant when dealing with the complexity of the  technology and the need to introduce operational procedures to the management of the  Network. This threat includes, but not limited to, the exploitation of flaws in the operational and  security management of the network; configuration, update and patch management of the  software. The errors from the lack or poorly design operational and security procedures may  have consequences to the integrity and availability of the network.  Abuse of authentication: This threat may affect multiple network entry points such as user  equipment (mobile devices and IoT), operation and management interfaces, roaming and  vertical services. This threat includes the theft of user credentials, brute force of user accounts,  password cracking, masking the user identity and impairment of an IoT grouping authentication  as techniques used by threat actors to abuse the 5G authentication systems.  Identity theft or spoofing: This threat may materialise when a malicious actor successfully  determines the identity of a legitimate entity and then masquerades to launch further attacks.  Identity spoofing is a threat that can affect any software component or human agent. In this  attack, the attacker spoofs the identity of a legitimate controller and interacts with the network  functions controlled by the legitimate controller (i.e. elements of the data plane) to trigger  several other types of attacks (instigate network flows, divert traffic, etc.). The use of social  engineering, brute force user account/password cracking may also be used as a technique to  spoof or steal user credentials.

THREAT AGENTS  In the next generation of Mobile Networks (5G), it is expected that the existing threat agent  profiles will develop towards a new set of capabilities and motives. This is due to the  overarching nature of the 5G Mobile Networks: they are going to play the role of ‘networks of  networks’, thus completely changing the use of the Internet and similarly, interconnecting  numerous verticals that until now have been operating in isolation. Due to their nature, 5G  networks will deliver multiple added-value and critical services and functions to the economy  and society. This will attract the attention of existing and new threat agent groups with a large  variety of motives.  Given this complexity, it is expected that the following facts are going to change the attacker  profile:   A whole set of new vulnerabilities will expand the attack surface, exposure and number  of critical assets.   New tools/methods to exploit those vulnerabilities will be developed.   New motives/ impacted targets are going to be observed due to the interconnected  verticals/applications.   Existing threat agent groups may be expanded with ones that have an interest in novel  malicious objectives.  These facts may cause an unprecedented shift of capabilities and objectives of existing threat  agent groups in ways that have not been seen in the past. The description of threat agent  groups takes all these considerations into account at a theoretical level. This is because the 5th  generation of mobile networks is not yet fully rolled-out and is currently in the pilot phase.  In the following descriptions, the threat agent groups introduced from ENISA Threat Landscape  201854 (ETL2018) are going to be used, extrapolated to the new facts potentially affecting  attacker’s profiles. Because of the latter, the new threat-agent group cyber-warriors will be  added to the existing groups. This is due to the fact that 5G Mobile Networks are going to  comprise a significant target for military operations, but also as a platform used for military  purposes, as already mentioned in some sources55,56.  ELT2018 categorizes thread agents as follows:   Cyber criminals   Insider (own, third parties)   Nation states   Hacktivists   Cyber-fighters   Cyber-terrorists   Corporations   Script kiddies  54 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018, accessed September 2019.  55 https://finabel.org/5g-implications-on-the-battlefield/, accessed September 2019.  56 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5g-weapon-should-we-scared-dr-michelle-dickinson-mnzm-/, accessed September 2019.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2018 https://finabel.org/5g-implications-on-the-battlefield/ https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5g-weapon-should-we-scared-dr-michelle-dickinson-mnzm-/  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  72  Another nuance that will be important in the development of threat agent profiles is the ability to  have legitimate access to the network: while legitimate internal and external employees are  covered through the agent group ‘Employees’, one needs to take into account that almost all of  the above mentioned external threat agents may have legitimate access to the network. This  will take the hurdle of access to the attacked system(s), facilitating thus their malicious  purposes.  Having said all the above, a short description of the 5G threat agent groups is as follows:  Cyber-criminals: Given the vast presence of this threat agent group in cyber-space and the  advanced capabilities that they continue maintaining, it is likely that this threat agent group will  keep its presence w.r.t. 5G Mobile networks. Given the statistics of activities of this threat agent  group,57 it looks like their attacks targeting multiple industries and governments may be  channelled to the emerging 5G Mobile Networks.58 Though not yet representing a significant  monetizing vector, such attacks (or preparations hereto), will be part of their activities.59 The  anticipated number of vulnerabilities, the complexity and low level of maturity of the 5G network  are indicative for this shift.60 Legitimate access of cyber-criminals to the 5G network may  exacerbate the threats posed by this group.  Insiders: Insiders are assumed to be a vital threat agent group in the 5G landscape mainly  because these are MNOs employees, in constant proximity with the core of the technology  representing a vast number of individuals. Other reasons substantiate the importance of this  group naming the complexity of the network and a large number of stakeholders engaged in its  use and operation. While the skill issue and increased complexity will surge the amount of  unintentional damages significantly, dishonest insiders and 3rd party employees may misuse  their access to vital network function to cause high impact/large scale availability issues in the  network itself. Such incidents may have cascaded impact on interconnected industries/verticals.  Given the fact that disgruntled/dissatisfied insiders are a primary target for high capability  agents, they might be recruited to abuse their insider knowledge, e.g. through monetary  rewards. Finally, given the current race for 5G patents/IPS matters, it is expected that this threat  agent group will have an additional motive to increase their activities.  Nation States: This threat agent group is important due both to its ability to compromise future  5G Network and its potential motivation to do so. It is indisputable that vendors of 5G  components – just like any other technology vendor– are in a better position to cause  devastating attacks to the operation of self-developed components, especially when  governments influence them. Given the importance of 5G to the sovereignty of nation-states,  they will most probably be a target of state-sponsored attacks. Despite the numerous activities  to setup vendor requirements namely, to understand the misuse vectors of various components  and design the corresponding security controls, it will not prevent a nation state from attacking  another country 5G Network. According to recent statistics,57 attacks motivated by espionage  represent a significant number in the 2019 threat landscape.  Cyber warriors: Cyberwar is, according to incident statistics,57 the third most frequent motive  and a trend that will inevitably keep up w.r.t. the 5G ecosystem. For many reasons, it is worth to  say that 5G infrastructure will be one of the most vital components to protect in the technology  landscape. This is mainly due to the need to maintain dominance, independence and  57 https://www.hackmageddon.com/2019/08/12/june-2019-cyber-attacks-statistics/, accessed September 2019.  58 https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/telecom-crimes-against-the-iot-and-5g/, accessed September  2019.  59 https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/02/cybercrime-will-be-exacerbated-by-5g-mcafee-experts-say/, accessed  September 2019.  60 https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49043822, accessed September 2019.  https://www.hackmageddon.com/2019/08/12/june-2019-cyber-attacks-statistics/ https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/telecom-crimes-against-the-iot-and-5g/ https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/02/cybercrime-will-be-exacerbated-by-5g-mcafee-experts-say/ https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49043822  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  73  sovereignty of a country, especially the ones in which a vicinity between vendors and  governments is being maintained (e.g. US, Europe, China). Moreover, there is evidence, that  the military sector will be interested in using 5G61,62, just as many security-related verticals (e.g.  critical infrastructures). Such a development will amplify the protection requirements and the  attractiveness of 5G as a target of cyberwar. Cyber warriors will maintain their presence in the  cyberthreat landscape with a focus on 5G in both roles of defender and offender, depending on  global geopolitical developments. It is expected that this is part of the agendas in the defence  sector, especially in those countries that strive for technological dominance and influence.  Hacktivists: Though this threat agent group has a presence in the cyberthreat landscape  (fourth position by means of number of incidents), it is not clear how it is going to be engaged in  5G malicious activities. While the most probable is to see this group engaging in regional  campaigns, it cannot be excluded that it could achieve high impact activities in national and  even global 5G infrastructures. Just as the efficiency of attacks of all other threat agent groups,  this will depend heavily on: a) the maturity of 5G rollouts w.r.t. cybersecurity protection  measures, b) the number of vulnerabilities of 5G components, c) the availability of 5G  exploits/malicious tools and modus operadi and d) the skill set available to master 5G  infrastructure complexity at the side of 5G stakeholders. Just as other threat agent groups,  hacktivist will be able to gain legitimate access to 5G network, hence attacking from inside the  network.  Corporations: Although this threat agent group has not enjoyed special attention in recent  ENISA Threat Landscapes, it is believed that its role will increase in future editions of the report.  The main reason lays in the intention to increase competitiveness and becoming part of the 5G  ecosystem. On the other hand, corporations will be interested in tracking the development of  patents and IPRs that are related to 5G infrastructure: given the emergence of 5G technology,  this area is going to attract the attention of this threat agent group mainly. Other reasons for  increased engagement are to trace the involvement of competitors to 5G procurements,  understand business opportunities related to 5G and strengthen their role in the market. Due to  the overarching nature of 5G, corporations from a large number of sectors/vertical will be  potentially attracted by 5G developments, increasing thus the number of entries into this threat  agent group.  Cyber-terrorists: There are multiple references to alleged interest from this threat group to  produce harm to 5G infrastructures.63,64 The main concern about future actions from this group  is the concentration of ‘values’ that will take place as a result of a 5G deployment. 5G is going  to (inter-) connect vast amounts of services that are vital to the society, governments and  business and this will thus attract the attention of cyber-terrorist groups. Through the integration  of multiple verticals, 5G will provide a single attack surface that once targeted, may result in  damages in the physical space (e.g. hybrid threats). Although incident statistics do not provide  evidence for significant activity of cyber-terrorists in the cyber-space, 5G stakeholder will need  to take the protection of this infrastructure very seriously to avoid high impact events that would  cause severe harm to society.65 This effort requires multifaceted/multilevel protection controls  involving coordinated activities of numerous stakeholders at a scale that had never existed  before 5G. This is a challenge that can be mastered, only if there is a concerted effort to protect  61 https://www.techradar.com/news/how-the-5g-network-could-benefit-the-military, accessed September 2019.  62 https://www.afcea.org/content/5g-warfighters, accessed September 2019.  63 https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/444251-5g-risk-is-about-more-than-simply-securing-competitive-advantage,  accessed September 2019.  64 https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/uk-security-chief-warns-of-5g-terrorism-threat/,  accessed September 2019.  65 https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020354/while-weighing-5g-security-risks-france-predicts-it-can- manage, accessed September 2019.  https://www.techradar.com/news/how-the-5g-network-could-benefit-the-military https://www.afcea.org/content/5g-warfighters https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/444251-5g-risk-is-about-more-than-simply-securing-competitive-advantage https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/uk-security-chief-warns-of-5g-terrorism-threat/ https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020354/while-weighing-5g-security-risks-france-predicts-it-can-manage https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3020354/while-weighing-5g-security-risks-france-predicts-it-can-manage  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  74  5G infrastructure and its importance goes beyond the threats posed by a single threat agent  group.  Script kiddies: The emerging technology landscape has many components that are in the  control of individual users. Examples are IoT devices, mobile phones, cloud and storage  spaces, social media platforms, etc. These components are the perfect playground for  technology-interested young individuals that have low motivation/low capabilities but are  equipped with malicious tools. In the past, we have seen high impact attacks (e.g. DDoS)  spreading from home devices and gadgets. With the availability of high-speed 5G networks and  interconnected devices, activities of this threat agent group may cause significant impact though  cascaded events affecting upstream components of 5G operators. Just as all other threat agent  groups, script-kiddies may possess legitimate access to the network and be able to use network  functions to manage their own devices, increasing thus the potential of misuse.

RECOMMENDATIONS/  CONCLUSIONS  7.1 RECOMMENDATIONS  Based on the assets, threats and the state-of-play of current developments, the following  recommendations/courses of actions can be made for various stakeholders of the 5G  ecosystem:  Recommended courses of action at EU level (e.g. Member States, European Commission,  ENISA):  Share existing 5G knowledge to stakeholder communities: Current technical material  should be disseminated at EU level. Consolidated results will enable evidence-based policy  actions. The content produced needs to be widely disseminated and settled as a basis for  guiding technical discussions and future iterations with all related stakeholder groups engaged  in policy-making.  Promote bridges between all stakeholders: Within the coming years, it will be important to  stimulate working relationships with all relevant 5G stakeholders with a focus on the material  that serves as a basis for future knowledge capturing and knowledge dissemination in the area  of 5G threat analysis. This needs to lead to an efficient network of experts in various domains  that will be responsible for contributing to the creation of 5G Cyberthreat Intelligence (CTI). This  material plays a central role in the production of future risk assessments, thus creating the  conditions to compatible/coherent risk assessments.  Enable the necessary iterations to improve the current material on cyberthreats: Together  with the engaged stakeholders, there is a need to create planning content for future iterations of  threat/risk assessment work to be performed by various stakeholders at EU level. This plan will  allow for better coordination of work; it will enable an efficient mobilisation of resources and will  create a competitive advantage for EU 5G stakeholders. Coordination with the work of 5G  standardisation bodies will be of particular importance. Coordination with EU 5G initiatives  active in the security field will also be key to achieve since delivering.  Recommendations for 5G market stakeholders (e.g. vendors, MNOs, Operators of Serices,  Standardisation Bodies, etc.):  Engage in EU-wide discussions on 5G matters: Organisations engaging in the 5G market  (e.g. vendors, operators and verticals) hold a significant part of the knowledge on 5G, as they  roll out initial pilots/versions of 5G infrastructures. Their experience in technical, organisational  and business issues of a 5G deployment are of particular importance for the generation of  practical security guidance.  Contribute to the knowledge collection/dissemination: A basis for injecting non-competitive  information will need to be agreed and built up. For this purpose, trust models among the  participating organisations need to be established. The provision of human resources to take  care of this interaction will be necessary.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  76  Bring in knowledge on economic/investment/market penetration dimensions: Currently,  too less information on economic aspects and investment plans on 5G deployment are  available. This information is necessary to assess the economic capacity of market players and  understand/prioritise feasible steps for the implementation of security measures, perform gap  analysis and understand the impact of security incidents. It is proposed to collect this kind of  information that will help to create more targeted guidance on 5G cybersecurity implementation  plans.  Recommendations for national competent bodies in the area of 5G cybersecurity (e.g. NRAs,  NCSCs, National 5G Test Centres, etc.):  Disseminate existing 5G material: Competent bodies are an important link in the  dissemination of 5G material from and to the EU stakeholders. This dissemination will need to  be performed in a coordinated manner to achieve coherence with and the extension of the  developed knowledge base. Such coordination will need to be performed within all national and  EU groups engaging in 5G activities. It will be subject of plannable consolidation efforts to be  taken into account within EU-wide plans.  Inform about 5G activities held in the scope of their responsibilities: Competent bodies will  need to inform national and EU 5G stakeholders/partners about their activities. This will help to  create national and EU-wide coordination and to leverage EU activities on national efforts.  Produced information will be hooked-up to corresponding activities accordingly. This will  contribute to an efficient mobilization and usage of existing 5G efforts/resources.  Provide available expertise and human resources: Available 5G resources are  scarce/limited. The efficient use of those resources will be necessary to achieve maximum  efficiency and reduce duplicated efforts. This will be a decisive factor for the achievement of the  tasks on the 5G agenda and will increase the trust among participating experts.  While the above may be advisable future actions for various stakeholder groups, ENISA  envisages an involvement in the following actions:  Disseminate current details of assets and threat landscape to all kinds of stakeholders:  This action will enable the creation of a common terminology and a shared understanding of  threat exposure of valuable 5G assets. This information will facilitate future interactions and will  provide a solid basis for future – eventually more detailed – assessments, while enabling the  expansion of the material on an on-demand basis. It will be essential to create feedback loops  to keep this material updated so that it builds a comprehensive and solid EU-wide knowledge  base (see also establishment of hooks below).  Refine/amend existing material according to the pace of 5G developments: While 5G  specification and deployment activities progress within the related market, additional details are  added to the current threat assessment to: cover emerging specifications, follow-up on further  information from current market and policy developments.  Establish hooks to enrol and mobilise strategic stakeholders: The current level of 5G  stakeholder engagement needs to be increased. Vendors, MNOs and NRAs need to be more  actively integrated into the related work. Moreover, better coordination with EU bodies needs to  be settled (e.g. NIS Cooperation Group, EU DGs and Units) to inject existing knowledge to  Member States and EU-policy activities. This action will come to amplify the effects mentioned  in the above points (disseminating knowledge and gradual amending existing material).  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  77  These proposals will need to be validated by Member States (NIS CG) and European  Commission. In this respect, ENISA may be tasked with technical work reflected in these  recommendations as deemed necessary.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR 5G NETWORKS  5G TL  |  1.0  |  External  |  NOVEMBER 2019  78  7.2 CONCLUSIONS  Concluding this first attempt towards the identification of 5G asset exposure to cyberthreats,  ENISA draws the attention of all relevant stakeholders to the above-identified  recommendations. It will be important to use this material in various stakeholder activities,  identify current and future developments and try to accommodate those in future versions of the  present report.  Such a development will speed up the adoption of security requirements and secure 5G  practices and will create competitive advantages within the entire EU space.  ENISA will continue engaging within cybersecurity activities of 5G. Coordination with EU-wide  activities will be key to the success of this attempt.  Future ENISA actions on this matter will be agreed upon, mandated and coordinated with  European Commission and Member States (NIS CG) as deemed necessary.  79  ANNEX A: ASSETS MAP (FULL)  5G  Assets

    "abstract": "This report draws an initial threat landscape and presents an overview of the challenges in the security of 5G networks. Its added value lays with the creation of a comprehensive 5G architecture, the identification of important assets (asset diagram), the assessment of threats affecting 5G (threat taxonomy), the identification of asset exposure (threats – assets mapping) and an initial assessment of threat agent motives. The information produced for this Threat Landscape is based on publicly available information published by 5G standardisation groups and bodies (i.e. ETSI, 3GPP, 5GPPP) and 5G stakeholders such as operators, vendors, national and international organisations. An expert group with experts from mobile operators, vendors, research and European Commission has contributed to ENISA’s work with information on existing 5G material, current developments in the market and research and quality assurance of the current document. Moreover, the members of the NIS CG, European Commission and ENISA have reviewed the current document."

Over the last five  decades, we have conducted research and developed  guidance that has led to extraordinary advancements in  cybersecurity.  Many of these advancements have taken on new life over  the years as the world of cybersecurity shifts and adjusts.  We look forward to outlining our accomplishments each  year in these Annual Reports as we share how our dynamic  projects help advance technology, cybersecurity and privacy  standards and guidelines, and measurement science for all.  You’ll notice that this year’s Annual Report has a new look  and feel. We are debuting a simpler format with less text  and more pointers to our helpful and robust websites, and  we organized the publication into seven key categories  (see our table of contents for a list, and read about each one  throughout this report).  This past year, NIST conducted research and demonstrated  practical applications in several key priority areas,  including Post Quantum Cryptography (and the selection of  PQC algorithms for standardization); an update to the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0), including new CSF  profiles; software and supply chain cybersecurity; our  Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity guidelines work;  launching a new comment site for our security and privacy  controls and baselines (so we can get our resources into the  hands of practitioners faster and improve the user  experience for our customers); and much more.  We are always learning, growing, and creating, so sometimes  we forget to take a minute to reflect. This year, we enjoyed  doing just that as we celebrated the very milestones that  make us unique.  - Kevin Stine, NIST Chief Cybersecurity Advisor  How did we celebrate  our 50th anniversary  of cybersecurity this  year?  • We launched a new NIST Cybersecurity Program History and Timeline tool, which provides an  overview of NIST’s major  cybersecurity research  projects, programs, and – ultimately – history.  • We set up a dedicated anniversary website that has everything in one place – blog posts, event details, and resources.  • We shared and collaborated on our cybersecurity Twitter account using the hashtag #NISTcyber50th all year.  https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/50th-anniversary-cybersecurity-nist https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022 https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/examples-framework-profiles https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/improving-cybersecurity-supply-chains-nists-public-private-partnership https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/public-comments-home https://csrc.nist.gov/nist-cyber-history https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/50th-anniversary-cybersecurity-nist https://twitter.com/NISTcyber  PAGE 6  Cryptography  PAGE 7  CRYPTOGRAPHY  Cryptography is foundational to our security and data protection needs.

We look forward to outlining our accomplishments each  year in these Annual Reports as we share how our dynamic  projects help advance technology, cybersecurity and privacy  standards and guidelines, and measurement science for all.  You’ll notice that this year’s Annual Report has a new look  and feel. We are debuting a simpler format with less text  and more pointers to our helpful and robust websites, and  we organized the publication into seven key categories  (see our table of contents for a list, and read about each one  throughout this report).  This past year, NIST conducted research and demonstrated  practical applications in several key priority areas,  including Post Quantum Cryptography (and the selection of  PQC algorithms for standardization); an update to the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0), including new CSF  profiles; software and supply chain cybersecurity; our  Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity guidelines work;  launching a new comment site for our security and privacy  controls and baselines (so we can get our resources into the  hands of practitioners faster and improve the user  experience for our customers); and much more.  We are always learning, growing, and creating, so sometimes  we forget to take a minute to reflect. This year, we enjoyed  doing just that as we celebrated the very milestones that  make us unique.  - Kevin Stine, NIST Chief Cybersecurity Advisor  How did we celebrate  our 50th anniversary  of cybersecurity this  year?  • We launched a new NIST Cybersecurity Program History and Timeline tool, which provides an  overview of NIST’s major  cybersecurity research  projects, programs, and – ultimately – history.  • We set up a dedicated anniversary website that has everything in one place – blog posts, event details, and resources.  • We shared and collaborated on our cybersecurity Twitter account using the hashtag #NISTcyber50th all year.  https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/50th-anniversary-cybersecurity-nist https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-algorithms-2022 https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/examples-framework-profiles https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/improving-cybersecurity-supply-chains-nists-public-private-partnership https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/public-comments-home https://csrc.nist.gov/nist-cyber-history https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/50th-anniversary-cybersecurity-nist https://twitter.com/NISTcyber  PAGE 6  Cryptography  PAGE 7  CRYPTOGRAPHY  Cryptography is foundational to our security and data protection needs.

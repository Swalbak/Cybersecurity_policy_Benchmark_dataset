It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal  proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or  other bodies in charge of legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because  they are electronic but have to assess these electronic tools in the same way they would do for  their paper equivalent.  To further enhance the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market, and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS  Regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust service  provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level  security and a higher presumption of their legal effect.  This document provides recommendations to help qualified trust service providers and auditors  understand the expected mapping between these requirements/obligations and reference  numbers of standards, as well as practical recommendations for their usage.  The document is structured in two main sections:   A section on “Requirements common to all QTSPs” that includes recommendations on  the requirements common to all TSPs and on the additional requirements common to  all QTSPs;   A section on “Requirements for provision of specific QTS”, to be used in addition to the  above, that includes specific recommendations for the provision of the qualified trust  services defined in eIDAS.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE ROLE OF ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity supports the European Commission and the  Member States on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations,  mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust  services and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic  identification (eIDs) included in the regulation.  ENISA also supports the national supervisory bodies in implementing their breach reporting by  aggregating their annual summary reports on trust service provider security breaches. The  Agency releases Annual Reports on Trust Services Security Incidents. Moreover, in a means to  support an efficient, effective process of reporting, the Agency has released the Visual Tool -  CIRAS to increase the transparency of cybersecurity incidents. The online tool is accessible to  the public.  1.2 BACKGROUND ON TRUST SERVICES PROVISIONING  Trust services and their provisioning are defined in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (hereafter the  eIDAS Regulation, or eIDAS [eIDAS, 2014]), on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.  Regarding the repealed Directive 1999/93/EC, Recital (3) of eIDAS states that it dealt with  electronic signatures without delivering a comprehensive cross-border and cross-sector  framework for secure, trustworthy, and easy-to-use electronic transactions. The eIDAS  Regulation has been implemented in such a way to enhance and expand the acquis of that  Directive to fill up this specific gap. In particular, as part of still ongoing work, this gap is and  should remain filled up thanks to a consistent and efficient mapping between the three following  frameworks:   Legal framework for trust services established by eIDAS and implementing acts. It  notably defines the requirements for provision of trust services and their legal effects,  in a way to remove barriers to their cross-border usage.   Standardisation framework1 provided by ETSI and CEN standardisation bodies and  relying on standards and “local” rules specified by other standardisation bodies such as  ISO, IETF, OASIS, UPU, and ITU. This framework aims to meet the general  requirements of the international community and eIDAS Regulation, to provide trust  and confidence in electronic transactions.   Trust framework established by eIDAS. This framework defines an ex ante and ex  post supervision model to supervise the compliance of QTSP and the QTS they  provide with the eIDAS requirements. The supervision model covers the full life cycle  of each QTS and each QTSP, from its genesis until its termination.  These frameworks, illustrated in Figure 1, are further covered in the next sections.  1 As covered in the remaining of the document, the eIDAS Regulation is technology-neutral. The legal effects it grants  should be achievable by any technical means provided that the requirements of this Regulation are met.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  6  Figure 1: Mapping between legal, standardisation, and trust frameworks  1.2.1 Legal Framework  The eIDAS Regulation establishes a general framework for the electronic identification of  natural and legal persons and for the use of trust services in the internal market.  One objective of this Regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  Regulation introduces the notions of QTS and QTSP with a view to indicate their compliance  with the eIDAS high-level security requirements and obligations.  In particular, the eIDAS Regulation defines 9 types of QTSs:  1. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures;  2. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals;  3. Provision of qualified certificates for website authentication;  4. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures ;  5. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal;  6. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signature;  7. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seal;  8. Qualified time stamping service;  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery service.  A natural or legal person providing one or more of these QTSs and that is granted the qualified  status by the supervisory body (SB) is called a QTSP.  It is possible to use non-qualified and qualified trust services as well as electronic documents as  evidence in legal proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-  border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal proceedings) cannot discard them as  evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess their validity in the same way they  would do for their paper equivalent.  When the provided trust service is qualified, the outputs of such services (e.g. qualified  certificate for electronic signature) can be used to achieve higher presumption of their legal  effects, e.g. equivalent legal effect of a qualified electronic signature and a handwritten  signature. For this purpose, the QTSP and the QTSs it provides (hereafter referred to as  “QTSP/QTS”) shall comply with high-level security requirements. These requirements are  covered in detail throughout the present document, along with recommendations for fulfilling  them based on standards introduced below in Section 1.2.3.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  7  1.2.2 Trust Framework  In line with the objective to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the internal  market, eIDAS establishes an ex ante and ex post supervision model to supervise the  compliance of QTSP, and the QTS they provide with the eIDAS requirements. This supervision  model takes place:   At initiation, on regular basis, and at any time2 to ensure high-level security of  QTSs: When a TSP without qualified status intends to start providing QTS or when a  QTSP needs to confirm (as part of a regular assessment or an ad hoc audit) that the  QTS it provides fulfils the eIDAS requirements and obligations, the QTSP is audited by  an eIDAS-accredited conformity assessment body (CAB); The resulting conformity  assessment report is then submitted to the SB which later decides to grant or, if  applicable, to withdraw the qualified status of the TSP and the TS it provides;   At termination3 to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs and to boost users’  confidence in the continuity of QTS: SBs should verify the existence and the correct  application of the provisions in the respective termination plans in cases where QTSPs  cease their activities.  This supervision model is the foundation of the trust framework as defined by eIDAS. It is  actually setting up a complete pyramid of trust for the QTSPs and the QTS(s) they provide, as  illustrated in the figure below:  Figure 2: eIDAS QTSP pyramid of trust  2 Initiation and supervision are further detailed in [ENISA Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services] and [ENISA  Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust Services].  3 Termination is further detailed in [ENISA Guidelines on Termination of Trust Services Provision].  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  8  At the top of the QTSP pyramid of trust is the trusted list. A trusted list is a signed XML file  including information relating to the QTSPs which are established in and supervised by an EU  Member State, together with information related to the QTSs provided by them, in accordance  with the relevant provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation. Those lists have constitutive  value and are the primary source of information to validate that a qualified status has been  granted by the SB to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides. Trusted lists are essential elements in  building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users to determine the qualified  status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Finally, to clearly identify themselves from non-QTSP, and thus contributing to transparency in  the market, QTSPs can promote their QTSs by using the EU trust mark; The usage of this trust  mark furthermore enables users to fully benefit and consciously rely on electronic services, and  thereby boosts their confidence in and convenience of online services.  The obligations of the QTSP regarding this trust framework (Article 20, 21, and 24.2) and the  usage of the EU trust mark (Article 23) are further covered in the related sections of the present  document.  1.2.3 Standardisation Framework  1.2.3.1 Context  The requirements established by the eIDAS Regulation are technology-neutral: It should be  possible to achieve the necessary security requirements through different technologies.  Some articles of the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular those laying down requirements for the  QTSP/QTS, allow for referencing standards or specifications via implementing acts. Compliance  to these standards or specifications would provide a legal presumption of compliance with the  corresponding legal requirements. In other words, this would declare one “recognised” way of  implementing the requirements, but not the only way.  So far, no such optional implementing act has been adopted. It is clearly expected from the  industry to self-regulate as much as possible within the legal and trust framework provided by  the Regulation. A list of the possible implementing acts and the description of their scope may  be found in other ENISA Guidelines, in particular [ENISA Analysis of standards related to  TSPs].  1.2.3.2 ETSI/CEN Standardisation Framework  In late 2009, the European Commission issued Standardisation Mandate 4604 aiming at  supporting Directive 1999/93/EC. This Mandate requested CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to update  the existing electronic signature standardisation deliverables in view of establishing a fully  rationalised framework, which would solve the issues raised in actual use of electronic  signatures in the EU. After 2015, the activities under the Mandate were extended via the yearly-  updated EC Rolling Plan for ICT Standardisation5 to cope with the extension of scope brought  by the then-upcoming eIDAS Regulation.  The end result of these standardisation efforts (as part of a still ongoing work) is a coherent set  of standards for electronic signatures and related trust services, aimed to meet the general  requirements of the international community to provide trust and confidence in electronic  transactions, and in particular EU legislation regulatory requirements from the eIDAS  4 http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf  5https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation/electronic-identification-and-trust-services-including-e- signatures  http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation/electronic-identification-and-trust-services-including-e-signatures https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation/electronic-identification-and-trust-services-including-e-signatures  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  9  Regulation6. For this reason, the present document focuses on this ETSI/CEN framework and is  based on the above-mentioned set of standards.  It is worth noting that this ETSI/CEN framework is standardising requirements for a PKI-based  implementation of QTSP/QTS and so is not technology agnostic: All documents of the  framework intend to cover digital signatures supported by PKI and public key certificates. A  digital signature is defined in ETSI ESI standards as “data appended to, or being a  cryptographic transformation of a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the  source and integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery”. When appropriately supported  by relevant trust services, digital signatures can support the implementation of trust services  outputs (e.g. electronic signatures, electronic seals, timestamps etc.) as they are defined in the  eIDAS Regulation. Because of this PKI-based orientation, these standards provide less  guidance (or possibly no guidance at all) for “alternative”, “innovative” or “creative”  implementations (e.g. blockchain-based timestamps) of the eIDAS requirements. In the latter  cases, the TSP may have to transpose the standardised practices and controls.  It is also worth noting that ETSI standards are not meant to be EU-only standards but  international standards that may be used in EU specific purposes and benefit to other non-EU  purposes aiming to reach the same level of best practices.  Structure of the framework  ETSI technical report [TR 119 000] describes the general structure for ETSI/CEN digital  signature standardisation, outlining existing and potential standards for such signatures,  referred to as the ETSI/CEN framework for standardisation of signatures.  As stated in [TS 119 100], to identify a single and consistent series of digital signatures  standards and with the aim to keep the same number for each document whatever maturity  level it reaches through its lifetime, a consistent numbering has been defined as DD L19 xxx-z  where:   DD indicates the deliverable type in the standardisation process (SR, TS, TR and EN);   L=4 identifies CEN deliverables and L=0-3 identified ETSI deliverables;   19 indicates the series of standardisation documents related to electronic signatures;   xxx indicates the serial number and -z identifies multi-parts as some documents may  be multi-part documents.  Regarding the above-mentioned serial number, this framework identifies six areas (identified with  Xxx) of standardisation with a list of existing and potential future standards in each area, as  illustrated in Figure 3.  6 https://portal.etsi.org/TB-SiteMap/ESI/ESI-ToR  https://portal.etsi.org/TB-SiteMap/ESI/ESI-ToR  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  10  Figure 3: Overview of ETSI/CEN standardisation framework  These areas are:  1. Introductory deliverables: gathering the overview document [ETSI TR 119 000] as  well as common definitions, studies, and other introductory deliverables related to the  framework for standardisation of signatures.  2. Signature creation and validation: focusing on standards related to the creation,  augmentation, and validation of digital signatures, covering:  a. the policy and security requirements for signature creation applications and  signature validation applications;  b. the expression of rules and procedures to be followed at creation, verification  and for preservation of digital signatures for long term;  c. signature format, packaging of signatures and signed documents; and  d. protection profiles, according to Common Criteria for signature  creation/verification applications.  3. Signature creation and other related devices: focusing on standards related to  qualified signature/seal creation devices as defined in eIDAS, on signature creation  devices used by trust service providers as well as other types of devices supporting  digital signatures and related services such as authentication. In practice, the  deliverables of this area have been produced by CEN, particularly the protection  profiles referred to in the present document.  4. Cryptographic suites: covering standardisation aspects related to the use of  signature cryptographic suites, i.e. the suite of digital signature related algorithms  including key generation algorithms, signing algorithms with parameters and padding  method, verification algorithms, and hash functions.  5. Trust service providers supporting digital signatures and related services:  covering QTSPs issuing qualified certificates, TSPs issuing public key certificates other  than qualified certificates, including certificates for website authentication, time-  stamping services providers, TSPs offering signature validation services, TSPs offering  remote signature creation services (also called signing servers).  6. Trust application service providers: covering trust service providers offering value  added services applying digital signatures and relying on the generation/validation of  electronic signatures in normal operation. This includes namely registered mail and  other e-delivery services, as well as data preservation (long term archiving) services.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  11  7. Trust service status (list) provider: covering standards related to the provision of  trusted lists as specified by [CID 2015/1505].  Up to five types of documents may be associated with each area:   Guidance documents;   Policy and Security Requirements;   Technical Specifications;   Conformance Assessment Guidance;   Compliance and Interoperability Testing.  More information on the ETSI/CEN standardisation framework may be found in [ETSI TR 119  000].  Standards for QTSPs  The main7 standards listed in the present document are from areas 4 and 5 of this framework  (Trust service providers and Trust application service providers, respectively) as presented in  the table below:  Source: ETSI TS 119 403-3.

The two figures below illustrate this structure for the issuance of qualified certificates and  qualified time stamps.  Source: ETSI European standardisation framework for trust services  Figure 4: ETSI standards regarding issuance of qualified certificates  Figure 5: ETSI standards regarding issuance of qualified timestamps  The standards listed in the figures above provide guidance and set requirements regarding the  operations of the QTSP/QTS. Other standards from ETSI may be referred in these documents,  either as normative reference or as guidance for implementations.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  13  Examples of these standards include:   Cryptographic suites: [TS 119 312];   Signature formats: ETSI EN 319 1x2;   Protection profiles regarding cryptographic modules, server signing, timestamping :  CEN EN 419 221 series, [EN 419 241-2], [EN 419 231];   Accessibility requirements: [EN 301 549].  Where appropriate, these standards are referred to in the sections below covering eIDAS  requirements.  1.2.3.3 Standards from other standardisation bodies  Other standardisation bodies such as ISO, IETF, OASIS, UPU, ITU, and national accreditation  or supervisory bodies are also defining “standards” or “local rules” that apply to Trust Services  and Trust Service Providers.  These “standards” and “local rules” are usually indicated in the ETSI/CEN standards as the  basis for the specific requirements or further guidance and implementation recommendations,  with the aim of further clarifying or supplementing these base standards in order to maximise  best practices, interoperability, and suitability to trust services.  References in ETSI standards to standards from other standardisation bodies include:   Standard(s) regarding due diligence and risk management such as [ISO/IEC 27002]  providing guidelines for information security practices and [ISO/IEC 27005] for  guidance on information security risk management as part of an information security  management system (ISMS) as defined by [ISO/IEC 27001];   Standard(s) regarding management of personal data (e.g. [ISO/IEC 27701]);   CA/Browser Forum (hereafter referred to as “CA/B Forum”) requirements, designed by  a voluntary group of certification authorities (CAs), vendors of Internet browser  software, and suppliers of other applications that use X.509 digital certificates for  SSL/TLS and code signing8. CA/B Forum work includes:  o Baseline requirements for the issuance and management of publicly trusted  certificates;  o EV SSL certificate guidelines;  o EV code signing certificate guidelines;  o Network and certificate systems security requirements.  A QTSP looking to be included in the browsers root stores may be interested in the  recommendations provided in Section 3.1.1.4.   Family of standards to the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure provided by IETF such as  [RFC 5280];   SOG-IS9 Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms to help ensure a high level of security in  the recommended cryptographic suites, in particular when creating and validating  digital signatures. ETSI standards such as [TS 119 312] on “Cryptographic Suites”  notably delegate the assessment of the security of underlying cryptographic schemes  to this document. Both documents are revised every two years and, in the case of new  attacks or of the immediate need to remove an algorithm could arise, a revision of [TS  119 312] is published as soon as possible.  8 Requirements for S/MIME certificates are expected to be published in the near future  9 https://www.sogis.eu/. Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms can be found via  https://www.sogis.eu/uk/supporting_doc_en.html.  https://www.sogis.eu/ https://www.sogis.eu/uk/supporting_doc_en.html  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  14  NOTE: Standards alternative to ETSI ones on PKI-based trust services exist but will not be  covered in the present document, such as [ISO/IEC 27099] on PKI practices and policy and the  ISO 14533 series on CAdES / XAdES / PAdES formats.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The audience of this document is TSPs, prospective QTSPs, and QTSPs looking for guidelines  for fulfilling requirements originating from the articles of the eIDAS Regulation based on existing  standards.  This document can also be used by auditors assessing (Q)TSPs, e.g. CABs, or Supervisory  Bodies, looking for a mapping between the eIDAS requirements and reference numbers of  standards, on which a (Q)TSP may rely.  1.4 PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT  This document provides recommendations to help stakeholders in understanding the expected  mapping between the eIDAS requirements and reference numbers of standards, as well as  practical recommendations for their usage. In the remainder of this document, unless stated  otherwise, a reference of an “Article” indicates an article of the eIDAS Regulation.  This document is an updated version of “Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards –  Technical guidelines on trust services”, published in December 2017, refreshed with standards  that have been published and updated since. The document is also based on the ENISA  deliverable from 2015 “Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers – Mapping of  requirements of eIDAS to existing standards”.  This document is structured as follows:   Section 2 “Requirements common to all QTSPs” that includes:  1. Recommendations on the requirements common to all TSPs (both QTSPs  and non-QTSPs), namely requirements on data processing and protection  (Article 5), on liability and burden of proof (Article 13), on accessibility for  persons with disabilities (Article 15), and on security (Article 19);  2. Recommendations on the additional requirements common to all QTSPs, as  required by Article 20, 21, 23, and Article 24.2 of eIDAS.   Section 3 “Requirements for provision of specific QTS”, to be used in addition to the  above common requirements, that includes specific recommendations for the provision  of the qualified trust services defined in eIDAS:  1. QTSP issuing qualified certificates for electronic signatures, electronic seals,  and website authentication;  2. QTSP providing qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures  (QESig) and/or qualified electronic seal (QESeal);  3. QTSP providing qualified preservation service for QESig/QESeal;  4. QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamping service;  5. QTSP providing qualified electronic registered delivery service;  6. QTSP providing remote QSCD services (i.e. generating or managing  electronic signature creation data on behalf of the signatory). This service is  not a qualified trust service per se but, as it shall be provided by a QTSP,  recommendations are proposed pursuant to the objective of the document to  provide recommendations for QTSPs.  This document structure is illustrated in the following figure.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  15  Figure 6: Recommendations for QTSP based on standards  1.5 DISCLAIMER  Due to the technological neutrality of the eIDAS requirements, it is worth noting that:   Different approaches based on different technologies than the ones exposed in the  present document can lead to eIDAS compliance;   Compliance against these standards (or other standards) is not mandatory to achieve  compliance against eIDAS requirements;   Compliance against these standards does not automatically imply conformance to  eIDAS requirements. Although these standards may be seen as best practices, there is  no automatic presumption of compliance10  to eIDAS after following the said standards.  10 Some nationally-defined schemes (e.g. [ANSSI, 2017], [NSA-CS], [DKPv2]) specify conformity criteria based on the ETSI  standards, along with a limited set of additional requirements, that provide presumption of compliance to the eIDAS  requirements.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  16  2. REQUIREMENTS COMMON TO  ALL QTSPS  In order to ensure due diligence, inclusion, transparency, and accountability of the operations  and services of QTSPs, all of them are subject to a common set of requirements:   As a TSP:  o Data processing and protection, as defined in Article 5;  o Liability and burden of proof, as defined in Article 13.2;  o Accessibility for persons with disabilities, as defined in Article 15;  o Security, as defined in Article 19.1 and 19.2.   As a QTSP:  o Specific requirements regarding initiation and supervision, as defined in  Articles 20 and 21;  o Specific requirements on the usage of the EU trust mark, as defined in Article  23;  o Specific requirements on the operations per se of a QTSP, as defined in  Article 24.2 (excluding Article 24.2(k) specific to the issuance of qualified  certificates).  This section details guidelines for QTSPs based on standards for the purpose of being  compliant with the above-mentioned requirements.  Figure 7: Requirements common to all QTSPs  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  17  2.1 ARTICLE 5 (DATA PROTECTION)  Article 5 states that:  1. Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive  95/46/EC.  2. Without prejudice to the legal effect given to pseudonyms under national law, the use  of pseudonyms in electronic transactions shall not be prohibited.  It is important to highlight that the Directive 95/46/EC is now replaced by the Regulation (EU)  2016/679 of 27 April 201611 on \"the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing  of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC\",  known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The ETSI standardisation framework addresses this Article with the requirement REQ-7.13-05  of [EN 319 401]. However, the mentioned requirement does not contain detailed information on  how to meet GDPR except that, regarding “the authentication for a service online, the  processing of identification data shall be limited to only those data which are adequate, relevant  and not excessive to grant access to that service online”.  Compliance to GDPR (and associated guidance) is a subject on its own and is thus outside of  the scope of the present document. Further information on this topic may be found for instance  in ENISA documents specific to the subject: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection.  In terms of standards, [ISO/IEC 27701] is an extension of [ISO/IEC 27001] for Privacy  Information, extending an ISMS (Information Security Management System) into a PIMS  (Privacy Information Management System). [ISO/IEC 27701] may be seen as a framework for  managing data privacy, and so may be seen as a tool to reach compliance to GDPR,  demonstrating that the TSP is “in control” regarding data privacy. It is worth noting that being  certified against [ISO/IEC 27701] is by no means a presumption of compliance to GDPR, and  similarly that GDPR does not mandate the certification or the compliance to the [ISO/IEC 27701]  standard.  Finally, it is worth mentioning that, in order to be useful in the context of demonstrating  compliance with Article 5, the scope of [ISO/IEC 27701] certification (the same applies for  [ISO/EC 27001] certification) should explicitly address the provision of the QTS(s) provided by  the QTSP.  2.2 ARTICLE 13.2 (LIABILITY AND BURDEN OF PROOF)  Article 13.2 states that:  Where trust service providers duly inform their customers in advance of the  limitations on the use of the services they provide and where those limitations are  recognisable to third parties, trust service providers shall not be liable for damages  arising from the use of services exceeding the indicated limitations.  The ETSI standardisation framework addresses this Article with the requirement REQ-6.2-01 of  [EN 319 401] that requires TSPs to make clear terms and conditions available to all subscribers  and relying parties, and in particular pay attention to REQ-6.2-02 items f) and g) of [EN 319 401]  11 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive  95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  18  so that these terms and conditions state any possible limitation of liability together with the  applicable legal system.  2.3 ARTICLE 15 (ACCESSIBILITY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES)  Article 15 states that:  Where feasible, trust services provided and end-user products used in the provision  of those services shall be made accessible for persons with disabilities.  The ETSI standardisation framework addresses this Article with the requirements REQ-7.13-03  and REQ-7.13-04 of [EN 319 401]. In particular this standard recommends taking into account  [EN 301 549], that specifies the functional accessibility requirements applicable to ICT products  and services, together with a description of the test procedures and evaluation methodology for  each accessibility requirement.  In practice, pragmatic ways of implementing Article 15 may include the setup of alternative ways  to reach the same objectives (e.g. a dedicated support line that persons with disabilities may  call if they experience difficulties with a webpage delivering the said product or service, so that  they may be guided efficiently through the same procedure).  2.4 ARTICLES 19.1 AND 19.2 (SECURITY REQUIREMENTS)  Article 19.1 states that:  Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall take appropriate technical  and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust  services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments, those  measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of  risk. In particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of  security incidents and inform stakeholders of the adverse effects of any such  incidents.  Article 19.2 states that:  Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall, without undue delay but in  any event within 24 hours after having become aware of it, notify the supervisory  body and, where applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the competent national  body for information security or the data protection authority, of any breach of  security or loss of integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided  or on the personal data maintained therein.  Where the breach of security or loss of integrity is likely to adversely affect a natural  or legal person to whom the trusted service has been provided, the trust service  provider shall also notify the natural or legal person of the breach of security or loss  of integrity without undue delay.  [Other requirements for the supervisory body]  Article 19 requires that all TSPs:  1. Assess risks. This obligation is addressed in clause 5 of [EN 319 401], summarizing  the five important steps for risk assessment, along with references to [ISO/IEC 27005]  and information security policy specified in the clause 6.3;  2. Take appropriate security measures. [EN 319 401] and the other ETSI policy standards  (related to provision of specific QTS) propose security measures that should be taken  by the QTSP. For instance, appropriate security measures for all (Q)TSPs are defined  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  19  in clauses 7.2 to 7.12 of [EN 319 401] that are all subclauses from clause 7 on “TSP  management and operation”, excluding clause 7.1 on “Internal organization” and  clause 7.13 on “Compliance” that are not related to security per se;  3. Notify the supervisory body about significant security incidents and breaches of  integrity. To that end, ENISA released an incident reporting framework for eIDAS  Article 19 in [ENISA Article 19 Incident reporting].  The implementation of this article and details on the three above activities are specifically  covered by the [ENISA Security Framework for QTSPs]. This document proposes a security  framework for QTSPs, on top of the one proposed for TSPs in [ENISA Security Framework for  TSPs], taking into account the type of provided QTSs, regarding policies, procedures, and  processes in order to be compliant with the security requirements defined in eIDAS under  aforementioned articles.  2.5 ARTICLES 20 AND 21 (SUPERVISION AND INITIATION)  Article 20 “Supervision of qualified trust service providers” and Article 21 “Initiation of a qualified  trust service” may be seen as not related to the core operations of a QTSP. However, they lay  down the foundation of a supervision scheme where the QTSP has an active participation, and  as such define clear requirements towards this QTSP.  On this specific topic of initiation, supervision (and termination), ENISA published a series of  deliverables whose objective is to propose guidelines aimed at facilitating the implementation of  the provisions related to it. These deliverables state:  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation  foresees an active supervision scheme of QTSP/QTS by the national competent SB  that supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and  obligations.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (becoming a QTSP/QTS), it will be  subject to a pre-authorisation process – the so-called initiation process in line with  Article 21 of the eIDAS Regulation. QTSP may only begin to provide the QTS after the  qualified status has been granted by the national SB and indicated in the national  trusted list as referred to in Article 22 of the Regulation. From there, the supervision  scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its genesis until its  termination.  The first deliverable of the above-mentioned series, [ENISA Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified  Trust Services], proposes detailed guidelines pursuant to Article 21.  The guidelines continue with:  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass,  and submit to the competent supervisory body a conformity assessment report (CAR)  issued by an accredited CAB confirming at least every 24 months, that the QTSP and  the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the Regulation. Competent  supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to audit  themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited  CAB to perform an ad hoc audit.  The second deliverable of the above-mentioned series, [ENISA Guidelines on Supervision of  Qualified Trust Services], proposes detailed guidelines pursuant to Article 20.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  20  Finally, the guidelines state that:  To ensure sustainability and durability of QTS, and proper termination and user’s  confidence in the continuity of QTS, QTSPs have to maintain an up-to-date termination  plan, as referred to in Article 24.2(i) of the Regulation.  The third deliverable of the above-mentioned series, [ENISA Guidelines on Termination of  Qualified Trust Services], proposes detailed guidelines pursuant to Article 24.2(i). Related  recommendations can also be found in Section 2.7.9 of the present document.  With regards to conformity audits aiming to confirm that the assessed (Q)TSP/QTS fulfil the  requirements of eIDAS, [ENISA conformity assessment of qualified trust service providers]  provides an overview of the conformity assessment framework for (Q)TSPs in the context of this  Regulation. This document can be used, for each phase of an eIDAS conformity assessment,  as guidance to QTSPs for the purpose of preparing and undertaking the assessment in the best  possible conditions.  2.6 ARTICLE 23 (EU TRUST MARK)  Article 23 states that:  1. After the qualified status […] has been indicated in the trusted list […], qualified trust  service providers may use the EU trust mark to indicate in a simple, recognisable,  and clear manner the qualified trust services they provide.  2. When using the EU trust mark for the qualified trust services referred to in paragraph  1, qualified trust service providers shall ensure that a link to the relevant trusted list is  made available on their website.  The purpose of this trust mark is to identify the QTSP/QTS and clearly differentiate them from  non-qualified trust services provided by non-QTSP. The objective behind the specification of  this trust mark is to boost confidence and convenience of online services that are essential for  users to fully benefit and consciously rely on electronic services.  Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the use of an EU trust mark by QTSPs is on a  voluntary basis.  The usage of the trust mark does not lead to any requirement other than those provided in the  eIDAS Regulation and CID 2015/806 laying down its specifications (such as size and design)  pursuant to Article 23(3). In order to help QTSP properly using this trust mark, the Commission  published12 explanations, practical guidance, and logos.  Regarding clause 2 of Article 23, as alternatives to a link to the XML version of the trusted list,  the QTSP may provide a link to the Trusted List Browser tool13 provided by the European  Commission. It enables any interested party to browse the EU trusted lists (and the information  related to that QTSP) in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, unlike a trusted list location that is  subject to change over time, a link to above-mentioned tool ensures to always redirect the  interested party to a representation of the trusted list downloaded from the last location notified  by the Member State to the Commission. To that end, the QTSP can either provide a link to:  1. A browsable version of the national trusted list, using https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-  browser/#/tl/CC where CC is the relevant applicable country code in two letters;  12 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-trust-mark  13 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-trust-mark https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  21  2. A browsable version of the QTSP information, including the qualified trust services it  provides, using https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/trustmark/CC/VATCC-  NUMBER where both CC should be replaced by the country code in two letters, and  NUMBER is the VAT Number provided in the trusted list as one of the trade names of  that QTSP14.  Both links (1) & (2) satisfy Article 23(2) and as such can be used in conjunction with the EU trust  mark for an improved user experience.  2.7 ARTICLE 24.2 (REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP)  Article 24.2 of eIDAS Regulation specifies 10 clauses for QTSPs providing QTSs. The following  subsections 24.2(a) to 24.2(j) refer to each of these clauses and propose guidelines based on  standards for compliance with them.  Article 24.2(k) is specific to QTSPs issuing qualified certificates and is covered in Section 3.1.3.  2.7.1 Article 24.2(a) (Notification of changes)  Article 24.2(a) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  inform the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its qualified trust  services and an intention to cease those activities  This article specifies that the QTSP shall inform the SB of:   Changes in provided QTS;   Its intent to terminate providing a QTS.  Implementation of this article is tightly related to the change management process. One of the  main goals of such a process is to introduce changes in a systematic, secure, and effective  manner.  The present document recommends that the reporting mechanism should provide event driven  triggers (according to threshold criteria: \"when to notify”) and communication channels (“how to  notify”) to report changes to a SB according to Member State regulations. It is a good practice to  create a communication plan associated with the change management process which covers  communication with a supervisory body.  ETSI standards do not impose any specific requirements or rules related to communication.  However, it is recommended that such rules should be defined and information about them be  included in the Trust Service Practice Statement (or the other practice statements such as the  Certification Practice Statement for the issuance of qualified certificates).  For changes made in the above-mentioned practice statements, [EN 319 401] specifies:   The TSP shall notify notice of changes it intends to make in its practice statement  (REQ-6.1-09); and   The TSP shall, following approval […], make the revised TSP's practice statement  immediately available […] (REQ-6.1-10).  For other changes (those not reflected in a practice statement), the present document suggests  to keep the same communication rules as above, with the exception that, when the QTSP  14 E.g. https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/trustmark/BE/VATBE-0408425626 to point to Zetes S.A./N.V. in the  trusted list of Belgium.  https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/trustmark/BE/VATBE-0408425626  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  22  intends to terminate its activities, it should be communicated to the SB earlier (than in the actual  termination process).  Further guidance on notification of changes under Article 24.2(a) may be found in the [ENISA  Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust Services]. Best practices regarding the change  management process can be found in chapter 12.1.2 of [ISO/IEC 27002] standard.  Regarding the specificities of termination activities, the second part of Article 24.2(a)  (information of the intention to cease activities), is covered by clause 7.12 of [EN 319 401]  which is required to be applied before the TSP terminates its services. Guidelines on these  termination activities are covered in further detail below in the section on Article 24(i)  (termination plan).  2.7.2 Article 24.2(b) (Human resources)  Article 24.2(b) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  employ staff and, if applicable, subcontractors who possess the necessary expertise,  reliability, experience, and qualifications and who have received appropriate training  regarding security and personal data protection rules and shall apply administrative  and management procedures which correspond to European or international  standards;  QTSP should build an appropriate organization structure. Staff with good knowledge,  segregation of duties and sufficient funds for maintaining this staff is a part of building QTSPs  reliability. QTSP should develop and maintain appropriate human resources processes and  procedures, education programs and keep records of such activities.  These measures should ensure:   Reliability and competence of candidates for employment;   Continuous personal education for staff and management;   Trainings sessions;   Security procedures trainings;   Sufficient human resources of the TSP to fulfil requirements of segregation of duty,  business requirements and implement countermeasures resulting from risk analysis;   Appropriate discipline;   Proper record keeping of these activities.  General requirements (applicable to any TSP) aiming to help TSPs comply with this clause are  set by clause 7.2 of [EN 319 401]. For detailed provisions, this standard refers to [ISO/IEC  27002]. In particular, best practices regarding human resources security, security roles and  responsibility and segregation of duties are described in clauses 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and 7 of [ISO/IEC  27002].  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to these  additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the following table.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  23  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates [EN 319 411-1] Clause 6.4.4  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441] OVR-7.13-04  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  - -  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps - -  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521] Clause 7.2.2  2.7.3 Article 24.2(c) (Liability and financial resources)  Article 24.2(c) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  with regard to the risk of liability for damages in accordance with Article 13, maintain  sufficient financial resources and/or obtain appropriate liability insurance, in  accordance with national law;  There is no ETSI standard defining how to meet this requirement; this is an identified gap in  standardisation. This matter is only referred to in [EN 319 401] via REQ-7.1.1-04, with no more  guidance than in the Regulation, but replacing “national law” by “applicable law”.  The gap can be addressed by extension to the requirement of the above-mentioned REQ, to  recommend that the assessment of “maintain sufficient financial resources and/or obtain  appropriate liability insurance” should be a risk-based approach, i.e. based on a risk  assessment, which takes into account commercial and financial issues, following local (national)  rules and legislation (if any) and good practices, as part of the risk management. Further  guidance on risk management is provided in the [ENISA Security Framework for QTSPs].  The most common approach towards the treatment of a risk of liabilities for damage is risk  sharing, and the most common countermeasure is insurance against the risks. A QTSP should  check the legislation related to the protection of consumers (subscribers) and trusting entities  interests, in the Member State in which it operates or would like to start its activities.  If a regulator expects a TSP to declare an amount of liabilities, it is the most cost effective to  establish a risk management process. The analysis of threats and potential losses per service  allows a TSP to calculate an amount of money to allocate to assure compensation for potential  damages or define insurance requirements and conditions.  2.7.4 Article 24.2(d) (Terms and conditions)  Article 24.2(d) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  before entering into a contractual relationship, inform, in a clear and comprehensive  manner, any person seeking to use a qualified trust service of the precise terms and  conditions regarding the use of that service, including any limitations on its use;  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  24  Use of trust services by subscribers and trusting entities requires notice or knowledge of the  terms and conditions of these services. One of QTSP’s obligations is to inform about terms and  conditions for each trust service. Information presented in the documentation should be up to  date, understandable, easily accessible, and conspicuously communicated to stakeholders.  Clause 6.2 of [EN 319 401] defines general requirements for the content of the terms and  conditions.  When relying parties need to acknowledge the terms and conditions, the good practice  proposed in the present document is the setup of an acceptance method, such as a mandatory  acceptance button together with the necessity to scroll down (i.e. “read”) the whole content.  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to these  additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  [EN 319 411-1]  Clause 6.9.4  DIS-6.1-04 to  DIS-6.1-09  REG-6.3.4-02 to  REG-6.3.4-03  OVR-6.3.4-04 to  OVR-6.3.4-06  [EN 319 411-2] Clause 6.9.4  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441] Clause 6.2  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511] Clause 6.2  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps [EN 319 421] Clause 6.6  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521] Clause 4.2  2.7.5 Article 24.2(e) (Trustworthy systems)  Article 24.2(e) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  use trustworthy systems and products that are protected against modification and  ensure the technical security and reliability of the processes supported by them;  There is no clear definition of “trustworthy systems” and “trustworthy products”. First,  “trustworthiness” can actually be defined differently depending on the type of the service.  Second, such systems and products can also be certified or not certified and hardware-based or  software-based.  In addition, it is worth noting that this clause does not relate only to trustworthy systems and  products that appear in dedicated QTSP-related processes (e.g. generation and storage of  cryptographic keys), but are also related to storage of data and supporting processes such as  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  25  “supplier service delivery management” or “system acquisition, development, and maintenance  management”.  Article 24.2(e) is explicitly covered by the set of requirements defined in clause 7.7 of [ETSI 319  401]. This article is also implicitly covered in this standard by:   Clause 7.5 on cryptographic control, in case the QTSP makes use of cryptographic  keys or devices;   Clause 7.6 on physical and environmental security, and in particular for components  whose security is critical to the provision of the trust service(s) and minimize risks  related to physical security;   Clause 7.4 on the limitation of QTSP's system access to authorized individuals (and in  particular REQ-7.4-02, REQ-7.4-03, and REQ-7.4-10 in the context of Article 24.2(e));   Clause 7.8 on the network and related systems security.  These clauses refer to [ISO/IEC 27002] and [CA/B Forum network security guide] for additional  guidance.  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to these  additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  [EN 319 411-1] Clause 6.5  [EN 319 411-2] Clause 6.5  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441]  Clause 7.5  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.7  Clause 7.8  Clause 8  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511]  Clause 7.5  Clause 7.8  PRP-8.1-01 and  PRP-8.1-03  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps [EN 319 421]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.8  Clause 7.10  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521]  Clause 7.5  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.8  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  26  In accordance with [EN 319 411-2], for QTSPs issuing qualified certificates, it is worth noting  that the generation of TSP’s key pair shall be carried out within a trustworthy system which:  a) is assured to EAL 4 or higher in accordance with [ISO/IEC 15408], or equivalent  national or internationally recognized evaluation criteria for IT security provided this is a  security target or protection profile which meets the requirements of the above-  mentioned standards; or  b) meet the requirements identified in [ISO/IEC 19790] or [FIPS PUB 140-2] level 3.  The same applies for QTSP issuing qualified time stamps regarding the generation of the  timestamping unit signing key (cf. [EN 319 421].  Regarding clause a) (on EAL 4 and [ISO/IEC 15408]), CEN EN 419 221 series of standards are  dedicated to the specification of common criteria protection profiles for TSP's cryptographic  modules, in accordance with [ISO/IEC 15408]. For QTSP issuing qualified time stamps and as  further detailed in Section 3.4, CEN published [EN 419 231], i.e. protection profile for  “trustworthy systems supporting time stamping”.  Regarding QSCD, and according to Article 30 and 39 of eIDAS, when a qualified certificate  relies on a QSCD15, this QSCD shall be certified against the requirements laid down in Annex II  of eIDAS; notified by the Member States to the European Commission; and published by the  Commission16. With regards to the certification of local QSCDs, [CID 2016/650] lays down the  list of standards to be used as part of their security assessment (i.e. the CEN EN 419 211  series)17.  The particular case of remote QSCDs (when the electronic signature/seal creation data is  managed on behalf of the signatory/creator of seal) is covered in Section 3.1 “Requirements for  QTSP issuing qualified certificates” and Section 3.6 “Requirements for QTSP providing remote  QSCD services ”.  2.7.6 Article 24.2(f) (Data storage)  Article 24.2(f) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  use trustworthy systems to store data provided to it, in a verifiable form so that:  i) they are publicly available for retrieval only where the consent of the person to  whom the data relates has been obtained,  ii) only authorised persons can make entries and changes to the stored data,  iii) the data can be checked for authenticity;  This article expands Article 24.2(e) by additional aspects concerning personal data handling. As  a consequence, the references to standards in Section 2.7.5 also applies to the present section.  Personal data is part of the sensitive information a QTSP acquires during standard operations.  Personal data protection is covered in Section 2.1 related to Article 5 on data processing and  15 The private key related to a qualified certificate does not necessarily need to be stored on a QSCD. But being protected  by a QSCD is requirement for a qualified electronic signature (as defined in eIDAS Article 3(12).  16 The list of SSCD and QSCD is currently published in https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member- states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  17 “Alternative processes” as defined in Article 30.3(b) might still be used in the case where the standards listed in Article  30.3(a) are considered as not applicable.

Depending on the type of services provided, Section 2.7.10 on Article 24.2(j)  provides additional guidelines in that respect.  Additionally, depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards  refine and extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to  these additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  (in addition to the ones mentioned above)  [EN 319 411-1]  Clause 6.4.3  Clause 6.4.6  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441]  Clause 7.13  Clause 7.5  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511] Clause 7.5  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps - -  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521] Clause 5.1  2.7.7 Article 24.2(g) (Measures against forgery and theft of data)  Article 24.2(g) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data;  Measures against forgery and theft of data shall warrant particular attention when the QTSP  takes appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services it provides as required by Article 19 (see Section 2.4).  It is recommended in the present document that such measures must be considered in nearly  all the aspects of the QTSP management and operations, and in particular the ones listed in  [EN 319 401] such as:   Human resources (clause 7.2);   Asset management (clause 7.3);   Access control (clause 7.4);   Cryptographic controls (clause 7.5);   Physical and environmental security (clause 7.6);   Operation security (clause 7.7);   Network security (clause 7.8);   Incident management (clauses 7.9);   Collection of evidence (clause 7.10);   Business continuity management (clause 7.11);   In case of termination (clause 7.12).  Measures derived from the above clauses can be expanded with the catalogue of available  ones in [ISO/IEC 27002], which is indeed referred to by the ETSI standards when applicable.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  28  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend the related measures. Where applicable, a reference to these additional measures may  be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  [EN 319 411-1]  Clause 6.4  Clause 6.5  [EN 319 411-2]  Clause 6.4  Clause 6.5  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.7  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.7  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps [EN 319 421] Clause 7.8  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.8  2.7.8 Article 24.2(h) (Records)  Article 24.2(h) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  record and keep accessible for an appropriate period of time, including after the  activities of the qualified trust service provider have ceased, all relevant information  concerning data issued and received by the qualified trust service provider, in  particular, for the purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings and for the  purpose of ensuring continuity of the service. Such recording may be done  electronically;  This requirement should be read together with Article 17.4(i):  […] the tasks of the supervisory body shall include in particular:  to verify the existence and correct application of provisions on termination plans in  cases where the qualified trust service provider ceases its activities, including how  information is kept accessible in accordance with point (h) of Article 24(2);  The preservation and accessibility for an appropriate period of time, including after the activities  of the QTSP have ceased, of all relevant information concerning data issued and received by  the QTSP are essential. It is in particular required for the purpose of providing evidence in legal  proceedings (e.g. audit on data collection and treatment), GDPR legal compliance, and for the  purpose of ensuring continuity of the service.  In that sense, it should still be possible to validate previous evidence created as part of the  qualified trust service or by means of its outputs. This may not require, except for the issuance  of qualified certificates, that the QTSP makes a copy of all such evidences from their creation  but that the necessary elements for validating them would be made available. Nevertheless,  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  29  recording all data issued and received by the QTSP, regardless of the type of QTS provided, is  recommended and may be proven to be useful to achieve the objectives of Article 24.2(h).  As an example, for QTSP issuing qualified certificate, [EN 319 411-1] (OVR-6.4.6-01) requires  the QTSP to record and keep available certain records (such as logs of event related to  certificates and relevant documentation) for a period of at least 7 years after any certificate  based on these records ceases to be valid (i.e. from when it expires or is revoked). Regarding  the period of retention, it is worth noting that “an appropriate period of time” may not necessarily  translate into 7 years. Application domains or sectoral regulations may require the period to be  considered as being much longer than that, and it is recommended in the present document to  consider this evaluation as part of the compliance management.  The termination plan, further detailed in the next section on Article 24.2(i), needs to include  procedures and means allowing the (Q)TSP to meet Article 24.2(h) of the eIDAS Regulation. In  particular, the termination plan should cover, at least, expected and unexpected cessation of  activities, the cessation of one, more or all the QTS from a QTSP, the potential take-over of  ceased activities by a third party or as a last resort by the SB, and the assurance of the  preservation and availability of the information referred to in Article 24.2.(h).  Additionally, it is recommended that the QTSP includes in its communication to subscribers (e.g.  as part of the termination notification and as part of the CP/CPS, terms and conditions)  information on the period of time during which the QTSP will ensure Article 24.2(h) referred data  are recorded and kept available and of the importance of the use by concerned parties of  appropriate procedures and technologies capable of extending such a period when applicable,  with regards to the data/records they are concerned with.  Types of records applicable to Article 24.2(h) are mostly dependent on the type of service(s)  provided by the QTSP.

As stated in Recital (41), Article  17(4) and Article 24.2(i), this document shall be verified by the SB because of its particular  importance regarding the sustainability and durability of qualified trust services and to boost  users’ confidence in the continuity of qualified trust services, such as in exceptional/unfortunate  cases of QTSP unscheduled termination (e.g. bankruptcy).  The termination plan should contain at least information on affected entities, reliable party  (parties) to which TSP obligations will be transferred, as well as a detailed procedure of  notification and transfer including a timing aspect with all affected parties taken into  consideration. Such document should be maintained as part of TSP documentation  management and change management processes, to keep it up to date.  TSP termination and termination plan are covered in clause 7.12 of [EN 319 401], where some  requirements or guidance may be found regarding the termination process. Clause 7.12 does  not however cover the actual content of the termination plan.  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations.

REQUIREMENTS FOR  PROVISION OF SPECIFIC QTS  This section details recommendations based on standards for QTSPs providing specific types of  QTS, to be used in addition to the above common recommendations, for the purpose of being  compliant with the requirements that are relevant for the provision of this specific QTS.  3.1 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP ISSUING QUALIFIED CERTIFICATES  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3 three types of certificates and three corresponding  types of qualified certificates:   Article 3(14): Certificate for electronic signature: an electronic attestation which links  electronic signature validation data to a natural person and confirms at least the name  or the pseudonym of that person;   Article 3(15): Qualified certificate for electronic signature: a certificate for electronic  signatures, that is issued by a qualified trust service provider and meets the  requirements laid down in Annex I;   Article 3(29): Certificate for electronic seal: an electronic attestation that links  electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirms the name of that person;   Article 3(30): Qualified certificate for electronic seal: a certificate for an electronic seal,  that is issued by a qualified trust service provider and meets the requirements laid  down in Annex III;   Article 3(38): Certificate for website authentication: an attestation that makes it  possible to authenticate a website and links the website to the natural or legal person  to whom the certificate is issued;   Article 3(39): Qualified certificate for website authentication: a certificate for website  authentication, which is issued by a qualified trust service provider and meets the  requirements laid down in Annex IV.  Qualified certificates for electronic signatures / for electronic seals / for website authentication  may only be provided by a QTSP that has been granted to provide the related qualified trust  service(s).  In addition to common requirements for all QTPs, this chapter addresses specific requirements  in relation to the provision of these qualified trust services. These requirements of eIDAS cover  both the operations of issuance of such qualified certificates as a trust service, and the content  of the qualified certificate itself. Articles defining these requirements are illustrated in the  following figure.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  33  Figure 8: Requirements for QTSP issuing qualified certificates for eSig / eSeal / WSA  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Yes Annex A of [EN 319 411-2]  Conformity assessment checklist Yes Annex B of [EN 319 411-2]  3.1.1 Preliminary recommendations  3.1.1.1 ETSI qualified certificates policies  This section refers to [EN 319 411-2]. Requirements defined in this standard are dependent on  the type of qualified certificate provided by the QTSP. In particular, based on the certificate  policies defined in [EN 319 411-1] (i.e. NCP, NCP+, and EVCP), the standard defines five  eIDAS qualified certificate policies:  1. QCP-n: policy for qualified certificates issued to natural persons offering the level of  quality defined in eIDAS for qualified certificates (so to be used for certificates for  electronic signatures);  2. QCP-l: policy for qualified certificates issued to legal persons offering the level of  quality defined in eIDAS for qualified certificates (so to be used for certificates for  electronic seals);  3. QCP-n-qscd: policy including QCP-n requirements and requiring the use of a QSCD;  4. QCP-l-qscd: policy including QCP-l requirements and requiring the use of a QSCD;  5. QCP-w: policy for qualified website certificates offering the level of quality defined in  eIDAS used in support of website authentication.  3.1.1.2 Qualified certificates for PSD2  Regarding the specific case of qualified certificates for PSD2 (Directive (EU) 2015/2366), and in  addition to the applicable requirements below, requirements on the certificate profile and on the  TSP policies are listed in [ETSI TS 119 495].  3.1.1.3 Qualified certificates relying on a QSCD  Information on the eIDAS QSCD can be found at the end of Section 2.7.5, related to Article  24.2(e) on trustworthy systems and products.  It is important to note that the QTSP issuing qualified certificates with the private key located on  a QSCD shall monitor the QSCD certification status until the end of the validity period of the  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  34  certificate (and shall take appropriate measures in case of modification of this status), as stated  in SDP-6.5.1-07 of [EN 319 411-2]. Following Article 30 (on the certification of QSCD) and  Article 31 (on the publication of list of certified QSCD), it is recommended that the QTSP  monitors this QSCD certification status in the list of those certified QSCDs (and SSCDs)  published by the EC19. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this list is not constitutive; A device  may be a QSCD but not appear on the EC list. In practice, there may also be a delay between  the certification/determination of a device as a QSCD and its inclusion in the EC list.  In the particular case of a remote QSCD, “monitoring the QSCD certification status” should be  understood in the broad sense of whether the remote QSCD can still “be considered as a  QSCD”. Indeed, this status may be lost for different reasons:   As for a local QSCD, because the remote QSCD lost20 its certification (and is removed  from the published list); or   because the QTSP managing this remote QSCD on behalf of the signatory/creator of  seal has lost its qualified status because its “last” QTS lost its qualified status21.  3.1.1.4 Recognition of qualified certificates for website authentication as Extended  Validation certificates by browsers  Inclusion in the CA root stores of the main browsers (but also software vendors such as Adobe  or Oracle) may be seen as an interesting feature. As presented in the introduction, the  CA/Browser Forum has adopted guidelines and requirements as a common basis for CAs for  their eligibility in the CA root store programs.  The standards that are published by ETSI are developed by experts from different industries  and requirements from the CA/B Forum are included in the latest standards (e.g. [EN 319 411-  1]).  Audit for compliance against these ETSI standards (by a CAB qualified for audits against ETSI  EN 319 411 standards series) is recognized by browsers for inclusion in the root stores.  Alternatively, demonstration of compliance via the WebTrust Program for CAs is another  recognized path.  It is worth noting that for both alternatives, the latest CA/Browser Forum guidelines and  requirements (which might differ from the standards above due to separate document lifecycles)  still typically apply together with specific requirements for each root store program22, and the CA  (here the QTSP issuing QWACs) must still apply separately for the inclusion in each root store  program it is interested in.  As the present document focuses on QTSPs under eIDAS, further details underlying the  recognition of QWACs as EVs are beyond its scope. More information on the topic may be  found in:   [ENISA Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits], in particular regarding the  relation between CA/B Forum guidelines, ETSI standards and WebTrust audit scheme.   The ETSI report [TR 103 684], in particular regarding legal context, supervision and  auditing, best practices, and trust representation of the WebTrust model.   [ENISA Conformity assessment of qualified trust service providers] regarding  multipurpose audits.  19 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  20 For instance, some QSCD certifications have an expiry date. But identified security vulnerabilities might also impact a  certification status.  21 A QTSP is qualified because it has at least one QTS.  22 See for instance https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  35  3.1.2 Article 24.1 (Identity verification)  Article 24.1 states that:  When issuing a qualified certificate for a trust service, a qualified trust service provider  shall verify, by appropriate means and in accordance with national law, the identity and, if  applicable, any specific attributes of the natural or legal person to whom the qualified  certificate is issued.  The information referred to in the first subparagraph shall be verified by the qualified trust  service provider either directly or by relying on a third party in accordance with national  law:  a) by the physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized representative of  the legal person; or  b) remotely, using electronic identification means, for which prior to the issuance of the  qualified certificate, a physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized  representative of the legal person was ensured and which meets the requirements  set out in Article 8 with regard to the assurance levels ‘substantial’ or ‘high’; or  c) by means of a certificate of a qualified electronic signature or of a qualified electronic  seal issued in compliance with point (a) or (b); or  d) by using other identification methods recognized at national level which provide  equivalent assurance in terms of reliability to physical presence. The equivalent  assurance shall be confirmed by a conformity assessment body  It must be stressed that this process is an essential part of the registration procedure for issuing  a qualified certificate, as this initial identity validation will determine the binding between the  (physical or legal) person and all subsequent signatures or seals supported by this certificate.  In addition, as stated in the eIDAS article, identity verification must be carried out in accordance  with the national law of the Member State in which the QTSP is established.  The process of identity verification has two key elements:   How the verification is actually performed;   If not performed with physical presence of the person, how the equivalence to this  physical presence can be ensured.  Generally, identity verification means collecting identity data and related evidence or attestation  from an appropriate and authorised source, checking its validity and authenticity, and binding  this data to the applicant. The most common way is to use a nationally recognized identity  document. Other means are for instance national registry information, bank or utility account  information, credit bureau information, or breeder documents (unless local legislation states  otherwise).  Guidelines on how to perform this identity verification may be found in clauses 6.2.2 and 6.2.3  of [EN 319 411-1] and clauses 6.2.2 of [EN 319 411-2]. However23, the requirements might be  seen as rather generic (no requirement on the verification procedure, definition of what “physical  presence” may mean or its equivalence in the light of new practices such as video onboarding),  considering the cruciality of this preliminary step.  23 The identity verification process in the certificate issuance process has a lot in common with identity proofing process  during (notified) issuance of electronic identification means. Therefore, another source of good practices (whenever  applicable) is the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 for the high and substantial assurance levels of  electronic identification means.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  36  As a result, a Specialist Task Force, STF 58824, has been setup at ETSI ESI. The scope of the  STF is “to produce specification on identity proofing for trust services as defined by eIDAS,  particularly for issuers of qualified and non-qualified certificates supporting electronic  signatures, electronic seals or website certificates. It needs to be aligned with, and to further  support the ETSI EN 319 411 parts 1 and 2 providing policy requirements for Trust Service  Providers (TSP) issuing such certificates”.  The expected results of STF 588 are twofold:   A survey of technologies and regulatory requirements for identity proofing for trust  service subjects: ETSI TR 119 460 “Electronic Signature and Infrastructures (ESI);  Survey of technologies and regulatory requirements for identity proofing for trust  service subjects” expected to be published in December 2020;   Requirements for identity proofing: ETSI TS 119 461 “Electronic Signatures and  Infrastructures (ESI); Policy and security requirements for trust service components  providing identity proofing of trust service subjects” expected to be published end of  July 2021.  NOTE: ETSI standards distinguish two types of identity verification:   Initial identity validation (clause 6.2.2 of [EN 319 411-1] and [EN 319 411-2]), where  the issuance of a certificate is meant for a person not registered by the QTSP;   Re-keying process (clause 6.2.3 of [EN 319 411-1]), which means the process of  issuance of a new certificate for the person who has already been registered by the  QTSP and possess a qualified certificate from this QTSP.  In case of a re-key request, the identity verification procedure can be simplified, where  existing evidence can be re-used to validate the identity, provided the evidence  remains valid given the time elapsed and it is allowed by the national legislation. In any  case, such a procedure must meet all the requirements of initial identity validation.  3.1.3 Article 24.2(k) (Certificate database)  Article 24.2(k) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  in case of qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates, establish and  keep updated a certificate database.  The QTSP shall maintain a certificate database. This database should be protected to ensure  availability and integrity and should be maintained on an operational basis.  To be compliant with this article, it is recommended to follow clause 6.1 of [EN 319 411-1].  24 https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STF-HomePages/STF588  https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STF-HomePages/STF588  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  37  3.1.4 Articles 24.3 and 24.4 (Certificate revocation)  Article 24.3 states that:  If a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified certificates decides to revoke a  certificate, it shall register such revocation in its certificate database and publish the  revocation status of the certificate in a timely manner, and in any event within 24  hours after the receipt of the request. The revocation shall become effective  immediately upon its publication.  Article 24.4 states that:  With regard to paragraph 3, qualified trust service providers issuing qualified  certificates shall provide to any relying party information on the validity or revocation  status of qualified certificates issued by them. This information shall be made  available at least on a per certificate basis at any time and beyond the validity period  of the certificate in an automated manner that is reliable, free of charge and efficient.  These articles are related to operating and maintaining a certificate database and in particular to  revocation management and revocation status services described (in particular) in:   Clause 6.2.4 of [EN 319 411-1];   Clause 6.3.9 of [EN 319 411-1];   Clauses 6.3.10 of [EN 319 411-1] and [EN 319 411-2].  Generally, validity / revocation status information should be available 24 hours per day, 7 days  per week. In case of failure, TSP should endeavour to ensure that this information service is not  unavailable for longer than a maximum period of time as denoted in the Certification Practice  Statement. As this availability is crucial, the QTSP should identify assets, vulnerabilities, and  countermeasures to minimalize risk of loss of availability. Following Article 19, it is  recommended to include these aspects in the global risk management process.  Two methods of providing validity and revocation status are the most popular: through a  Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Clause 6.3.10 of  [EN 319 411-1] provides further guidance on the selection of the method(s).  In case both methods are supported by a TSP, the information provided by all services shall, as  required by eIDAS, be consistent over time. Different delays in updating the status information  for all these methods should be taken into account.  For more information about availability of service assurance, one can refer to [ISO/IEC 20000-1]  clause 6.  3.1.5 Articles 28.1-3, 38.1-3, and 45 (Content of certificates)  Article 28.1 to 28.3 states that:  1. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall meet the requirements laid down  in Annex I.  2. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall not be subject to any mandatory  requirement exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex I.  3. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures may include non-mandatory additional  specific attributes. Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition  of qualified electronic signatures.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  38  Article 38.1 to 38.3 states that:  1. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall meet the requirements laid down in  Annex III.  2. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall not be subject to any mandatory  requirements exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex III.  3. Qualified certificates for electronic seals may include non-mandatory additional  specific attributes. Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition  of qualified electronic seals.  Article 45.1 states that:  1. Qualified certificates for website authentication shall meet the requirements laid down  in Annex IV.  These requirements address the content of the certificates. Annex I, III, and IV of the eIDAS  Regulation contain detailed requirements for certificate content. A QTSP issuing qualified  certificates should prepare a certificate profile for this purpose. The Regulation mandates only  information listed in Annex I, III, and IV to be present, but other information can be added by a  QTSP.  Regarding the profile of certificates, it is recommended to follow:   [EN 319 411-1] clause 6.6.1;   [EN 319 411-2] clause 6.6.1;  NOTE: While following [EN 319 411-1] or [EN 319 411-2] it is a non-mandatory  recommendation to be compliant with the eIDAS requirements, claiming for a TSP to  be compliant with [EN 319 411-1] or [EN 319 411-2] requires compliance to (where  applicable) [EN 319 412-2], [EN 319 412-3], [EN 319 412-4] and [EN 319 412-5], as  stated in clause 6.6.1 of [EN 319 411-1] and clause 6.6.1 of [EN 319 411-2].   [EN 319 412-1], providing an overview and common data structures on certificate  profiles;   [EN 319 412-2], providing certificate profile for certificates issued to natural persons  (so to be used for certificates for electronic signatures);   [EN 319 412-3], providing certificate profile for certificates issued to legal persons (so  to be used for certificates for electronic seals);   [EN 319 412-4], providing certificate profile for web site certificates (so to be used for  certificates for website authentication);   [EN 319 412-5], standardizing indications related to qualified certificates per se.  NOTE: In Annex I a), III a) and IV a), eIDAS doesn’t mandate the use the ETSI “id-etsi-  qcs-QcCompliance (id-etsi-qcs 1)” statement, further specified by the “id-etsi-qcs-  QcType (id-etsi-qcs 6)” defined in [EN 319 412-5] as “indication at least in a form  suitable for automated processing” that the certificate has been issued as a qualified  certificate and for which type. Still, the use of these standardised statements are highly  recommended as the specifications of the EU MS trusted lists defined in CID (EU)  2015/1505 are using these statements as the “benchmark statements” for the machine  processable indication referred above. The same applies for the ETSI “id-etsi-qcs-  QcSSCD (id-etsi-qcs 4)” as “indication at least in a form suitable for automated  processing” that the corresponding private key is located in an EU QSCD.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  39  All the certificate profiles specified in the ETSI EN 319 412 series are based upon  [Recommendation ITU-T X.509] and [RFC 5280]. It is important to note that point (b) of Annexes  I, III, and IV of the eIDAS Regulation requires that qualified certificates shall include:  a set of data unambiguously representing the qualified trust service provider issuing  the qualified certificates including at least the Member State in which that provider is  established and:  - for a legal person: the name and, where applicable, registration number as  stated in the official records;  - for a natural person: the person’s name.  The best practice to implement this requirement is by using the organizationName attribute  (“O=” attribute) of the Issuer field of the qualified certificate. As per [RFC 5280] specifications,  the “O=” attribute of the Issuer field of the qualified certificate shall be identical to the Subject  field of the issuing CA certificate. In accordance with point (b) of the Annexes, this “O=” attribute  must be identical – preferably case sensitively – to the name of the QTSP as stated in the  official records and hence the name (or trade name if applicable) present in the trusted list25.  Additionally, where applicable, the qualified certificate should also contain in the  organizationIdentifier attribute the registration number as stated in the official records. Further  guidance on the latter may be found in [EN 319 412-1].  Implementing additional attributes should be developed according to the same rules. During  development of additional fields in certificate structure, the TSP may use the [EN 319 412-1]  standard. As stated in the eIDAS article, introduction of additional (non-mandatory) attributes  should not affect mandatory interoperability. Examples of additional (non-mandatory) attributes  are: Organizational Unit, State or Province Name, Locality, Title.  The QTSP should also keep the certificate profile adequate to applicable regulations.  3.1.6 Articles 28.4 and 38.4 (Certificate revocation)  These articles only apply to certificates for electronic signatures and certificates for electronic  seals, excluding certificates for website authentication.  Article 28.4 (the same applies to Article 38.4 where ‘signature’ is replaced by ‘seal’) states  that:  If a qualified certificate for electronic signatures has been revoked after initial  activation, it shall lose its validity from the moment of its revocation, and its status  shall not in any circumstances be reverted.  This article concerns qualified certificates for electronic signatures/seals that have been revoked  after initial activation. It is therefore allowed and is a good/acceptable practice to create  qualified certificate in a “on hold” status before its initial activation (e.g. once QTSP is convinced  that it has been issued to the right person). At initial activation, this “on hold” status is reverted  but after this, a potential revocation shall never be reverted, as required by Article 28.4.  TSP should conduct risk analysis to recognize all potential activities which can lead to  reinstating a revoked certificate, for example restoring from backup. After the identification of  potential threats appropriate countermeasures should be taken. A suggested solution is to  25 The issuing CA certificate is usually provided by the TSP to the Trusted List Scheme Operator to be listed in the trusted  list as the Service Digital Identity (SDI), defined in clause 5.5.3 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1, made mandatory by [CID  2015/1505] on technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists.  Clause 5.5.3 defines specific requirements on the “O=” attribute of the SDI. Non-compliance with this clause can reflect a  potential non-compliance with [CID 2015/1505] and therefore eIDAS Regulation.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  40  choose an appropriate technology which prevents reinstating revoked certificates, or to enable  the replay (e.g. based on logs) of all applicable revocations since the last backup.  Before a TSP issues a certificate, some obligations should be accepted by the subject and/or  subscriber. One of them is not to create any electronic signature with the private key if the  certificate has been revoked (cf. [EN 319 411-1] OVR-6.3.5-01 j)).  As required by REV-6.3.9-01 of [EN 319 411-1], the TSP shall revoke certificates in a timely  manner based on authorized and validated certificate revocation requests mentioned in clause  6.2.4 of [EN 319 411-1] and [EN 319 411-2].  Recommendations to achieve compliance with these articles are proposed in REV-6.3.9-04 of  [EN 319 411-1]26.  3.1.7 Articles 28.5 and 38.5 (Temporary suspension of certificates)  These articles only apply to certificates for electronic signatures and certificates for electronic  seals, excluding certificates for website authentication27.  Article 28.5 (the same applies to Article 38.5 where ‘signature’ is replaced by ‘seal’) states  that:  Subject to the following conditions, Member States may lay down national rules on  temporary suspension of a qualified certificate for electronic signature:  a) if a qualified certificate for electronic signature has been temporarily suspended  that certificate shall lose its validity for the period of suspension;  b) the period of suspension shall be clearly indicated in the certificate database and  the suspension status shall be visible, during the period of suspension, from the  service providing information on the status of the certificate.  Certificate suspension is subject to national regulation, and so may vary between Member  States28. The TSP should perform a compliance management process to ensure compliance to  local regulation of the Member state in which it is established.  If suspension is allowed in a Member State, it is recommended to follow the provisions of:   [EN 319 411-1] clauses 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10;   [EN 319 411-2] clauses 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10.  In case of discrepancies between the standards and national law, national law prevails.  26 It should be noted that, while these eIDAS articles exclude certificates for website authentication, the corresponding  clauses of [EN 319 411-1] apply to them as well. As such, these may be seen as recommendations for certificates for  website authentication.  27 Similarly to the previous section, while the eIDAS articles exclude certificates for website authentication, the  corresponding clauses of [EN 319 411-1] apply to them as well. As such, these may be seen as recommendations for  certificates for website authentication.  28 For instance, suspension of qualified certificate for electronic signatures, electronic seals and website authentication is  forbidden in France, as stated in Section II.3.4. of https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/eidas_delivrance-certificats- qualifies_v1.1_anssi.pdf (in French), but allowed in Luxembourg.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/eidas_delivrance-certificats-qualifies_v1.1_anssi.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/eidas_delivrance-certificats-qualifies_v1.1_anssi.pdf  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  41  3.2 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING QUALIFIED VALIDATION  SERVICES FOR QESIG/QESEAL  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(41) a validation as the process of verifying and  confirming that an electronic signature or a seal is valid. Validation of the signature of an  electronic transaction is an essential process for allowing any relying party to trust the  corresponding signed data and/or document.  In a nutshell (detailed validation process is further covered below), for a qualified electronic  signature, the validation service consists in verifying that it meets the requirements set out in  Article 26 (requirements on advanced electronic signatures), it is created by a QSigCD 29, and it  is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. For a qualified electronic seal, the  validation service consists in verifying that it meets the requirements set out in Article 36  (requirements on advanced electronic seals), is created by a QSealCD, and it is based on a  qualified certificate for electronic seal.  A QTSP may be granted a qualified status to provide both of these services, or only one of them.  Requirements on the validation of qualified electronic signatures are specified in Article 32 and  33 of eIDAS. Regarding the validation of qualified electronic seals, Article 40 of eIDAS states that  these articles \"shall apply mutatis mutandis to the validation […] of qualified electronic seals\".  In particular, the qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures and seals is  specified by:   Article 33 (resp. Article 40) for the requirements on qualified validation services of  qualified electronic signatures/seals; which includes by reference;   Article 32 (resp. Article 40) for the requirements on the validation of qualified electronic  signatures/seals.  Figure 9: Requirements for QTSP providing qualified validation services for QESig / QESeal  The table below indicates whether a mapping with the eIDAS Regulation and whether a  conformity assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI  standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Yes Annex B and C of [TS 119 441]  Conformity assessment checklist Yes Annex E of [TS 119 441]  29 QSCD stands for both QSigCD and QSealCD. In case of ambiguity or necessity, the explicit acronym QSigCD or  QSealCD is used.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  42  3.2.1 Article 32 (Validation of QESig/QESeal)  Article 32.1 states that:  The process for the validation of a qualified electronic signature shall confirm the validity  of a qualified electronic signature provided that:  a) the certificate that supports the signature was, at the time of signing, a qualified  certificate for electronic signature complying with Annex I;  b) the qualified certificate was issued by a qualified trust service provider and was  valid at the time of signing;  c) the signature validation data corresponds to the data provided to the relying  party;  d) the unique set of data representing the signatory in the certificate is correctly  provided to the relying party;  e) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated to the relying party if a pseudonym  was used at the time of signing;  f) the electronic signature was created by a qualified electronic signature creation  device;  g) the integrity of the signed data has not been compromised;  h) the requirements provided for in Article 26 were met at the time of signing.  Article 32.2 states that:  The system used for validating the qualified electronic signature shall provide to the  relying party the correct result of the validation process and shall allow the relying  party to detect any security relevant issues.  NOTE: Use of pseudonym (see Article 32.1(e)) is not applicable to electronic seals.  Several ETSI standards currently exists regarding the validation process:   [TS 119 441] specifying policy requirements for TSP providing signature validation  services;   [TS 119 172-4] (currently in draft) on the signatures applicability rules (validation  policy) for European qualified electronic signatures/seals using trusted lists. This  standard Provides rules for the determination of the technical suitability of a digital  signature to be considered QES by making reference to:  o [EN 319 102-1] / [TS 119 102-1] specifying procedures for validation of digital  signatures. This standard is to be used to validate whether the provided digital  signature/seal is an advanced electronic signature/seal in the sense of eIDAS.  This document refers to [TS 119 312] for guidance regarding the  cryptographic algorithm’s validity, based on the agreed cryptographic  mechanisms from SOG-IS;  When validating a signature, the QTSP must take care of the potential  security related issues against either national rules or [TS 119 312].  o [TS 119 615] (currently in draft) on the procedures for using and interpreting  European Union Member States National Trusted Lists. This standard is to be  used to validate the qualified status of the electronic signature/seal.   These standards rely on the definition of an AdES (digital) signature as a digital  signature that is either a CAdES signature (as specified in [EN 319 122-1] or older), or  a PAdES signature (as specified is [EN 319 142-1] or older) or a XAdES signature (as  specified is [EN 319 132-1] or older)30;  30 At the time of writing, a new format, JAdES signature, is being specified under [TS 119 182-1].  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  43   These standards refer to [TS 119 101] defining policy and security requirements for  applications for signature creation and signature validation.  In addition to the above standards and ETSI Conformance Checkers, the European  Commission has made available different tools and documents that may be found helpful for  implementing signatures/seals validation:   DSS (Digital Signature Services)31: an open-source software library for digital signature  creation, validation, and augmentation, designed to help digital solutions achieve  compliance with the eIDAS Regulation, either by integrating it or cross-checking an  implementation against it;   DSS Demonstration WebApp32 : a demonstration of integration of the DSS library in a  web application;   “Introduction to the Qualified electronic signature (QES) validation algorithm33”: a  document describing the validation algorithm used by DSS library, aligned with the  above-listed standards;   Test cases for assessing an implementation of electronic signatures and seals  validation34: A web site hosting 100+ test cases35 that can be used by a TSP or by any  conformity assessment body or supervisory body to verify or demonstrate the  conformity a validation service.  3.2.2 Article 33 (Qualified validation service for QESig/QESeal)  Article 33.1 states that:  A qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a  qualified trust service provider who:  a) provides validation in compliance with Article 32(1); and  b) allows relying parties to receive the result of the validation process in an automated  manner, which is reliable, efficient and bears the advanced electronic signature or  advanced electronic seal of the provider of the qualified validation service.  Article 33 (resp. Article 40 for qualified electronic seals) defines requirements for QTSPs  providing qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures. It shall:   be provided by a QTSP;   provide validation in compliance with Article 32 for which guidelines are provided  above;   provide the validation result in an automated manner that needs:  o to be reliable and efficient; and  o to bear the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the  QTSP providing the qualified validation service.  Requirements on the validation result (or validation report) are provided in Annex B of [TS 119 441].  31 https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/DSS  32 Hosted by the European Commission and currently available via https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/DSS/webapp-demo/  33 Currently available via  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Qualified+electronic+signature+%28QES%29+validation+algorithm  34 Hosted by the European Commission and currently available via https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/esig-validation- tests/testcases  35 Algorithms in [TS 119 615] and [TS 119 172-4] have shown that there can be identified 100+ variations of cases based  on combinations of the certificate content, trusted list content, pre/post-eIDAS time of signing, etc.  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/DSS https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/DSS/webapp-demo/ https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Qualified+electronic+signature+%28QES%29+validation+algorithm https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/esig-validation-tests/testcases https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/esig-validation-tests/testcases  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  44  Additionally, [TS 119 102-2] specifies a recommended general structure and XML format for  reporting the validation of digital signatures, in line with the requirements specified in [EN 319 102-  1] / [TS 119 102-1].  3.3 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING QUALIFIED  PRESERVATION SERVICE FOR QESIG/QESEAL  Preservation under eIDAS ensures the long-term preservation of the trustworthiness of  electronic signatures and seals, in order (cf. Recital (61) of eIDAS) “to ensure their legal validity  over extended periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future  technological changes”.  Requirements for qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures are laid down  in Article 34 of eIDAS Regulation, which defines the purpose of such preservation to be  “extending the trustworthiness of the qualified electronic signature beyond the technological  validity period”.  This type of service should not be confused with electronic archiving aimed at ensuring that a  document is stored (or converted from a paper-based original version) in order to guarantee its  integrity and benefit from legal features). Electronic archiving has not been identified as a trust  service under eIDAS (as detailed in the definition under Article 3(16), which is a closed list of  trust services). Consequently, the definition of requirements on electronic archiving remains the  competence of Member States. More information on the differences and relationships between  an archival service and a preservation service can be found in [TS 119 511], such as:   The preservation of an electronic signature could be achieved through PKI-based  signature augmentation, without storage by the TSP;   The preservation of an electronic signature could be achieved through electronic  archiving (i.e. with storage by the TSP) ensuring that the signature has not been  modified since its submission to the TSP.  Requirements for a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals are laid down in  Article 40 and states that Article 34 \"shall apply mutatis mutandis to the […] preservation of  qualified electronic seals\".  Figure 10: Requirements for QTSP providing qualified preservation service for QESig / QESeal  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Yes Annex B of [TS 119 511]  Conformity assessment checklist No N/A  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  45  3.3.1 Article 34 (Qualified preservation service for QESig/QESeal)  Article 34.1 states that:  A qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be  provided by a qualified trust service provider that uses procedures and technologies  capable of extending the trustworthiness of the qualified electronic signature beyond  the technological validity period.  Standards that are proposed by ETSI to TSP providing preservation services are:   [TS 119 511] “Policy and security requirements for trust service providers providing  long-term preservation of digital signatures or general data using digital signature  techniques”;   [TS 119 512] “Protocols for trust service providers providing long-term data  preservation services”.  More specifically, in order to achieve compliance with Article 34 (resp. Article 40), [TS 119 511]  sets requirements on:   Cryptographic monitoring in clause 7.14. In particular, [TS 119 312] may be considered  when evaluating the cryptographic algorithm (NOTE: this standard may be superseded  by national recommendations);   Augmentation of preservation evidences in clause 7.15;   Preservation evidences in clause 9.2;   Preservation of digital signatures in clause 9.3;   Verification of the qualified status of the signature or the seal in OVR-A-02.  In line with Article 24.2(e) on trustworthy systems, in order to ensure secure communication  between the preservation client and the PSP (authentication of the client and confidentiality of  the data), [TS 119 511] refers to [TS 119 512] for the preservation protocol (clause 8.1).  3.4 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP ISSUING QUALIFIED ELECTRONIC TIME  STAMPS  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(33) an electronic time stamp as data in electronic  form which binds other data in electronic form to a particular time establishing evidence that the  latter data existed at that time.  A qualified electronic time stamp is defined in Article 3(34) as an electronic time stamp which  meets the requirements laid down in Article 42. A qualified time stamp enjoys the legal  presumption of the accuracy of the date and time it indicates and of the integrity of stamped  data from the time of stamping (cf. Article 41(2)).  Figure 11: Requirements for QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  46  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Partial Annex E of [EN 319 421]  Conformity assessment checklist Yes Annex H of [EN 319 421]  3.4.1 Article 42 (Qualified electronic time stamp)  Article 42 states that:  A qualified electronic time stamp shall meet the following  requirements:  a) it binds the date and time to data in such a manner as to  reasonably preclude the possibility of the data being changed  undetectably;  b) it is based on an accurate time source linked to Coordinated  Universal Time; and  c) it is signed using an advanced electronic signature or sealed  with an advanced electronic seal of the qualified trust service  provider, or by some equivalent method.  Standards that are proposed by CEN and ETSI to TSP providing a time-stamping service are:   [EN 319 421] “Policy and Security Requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing  Electronic Time-Stamps” enforcing good security practices and correct time-  management of a timestamping authority;   [EN 319 422] “Time-stamping protocol and electronic time-stamp profiles” ensuring the  binding of the date and time to data in the produced timestamps;   [EN 419 231] “Protection profile for trustworthy systems supporting time stamping”.  More specifically, in order to aim for compliance with Article 42, [EN 319 421] specifies that:   Issued time stamps shall conform with the time stamp profile defined in [EN 319 422].  This intends to achieve compliance with the eIDAS definition of an electronic time stamp;   Time stamps shall be issued securely. This is covered by clause d) and e) of [EN 319  421] clause 7.7.1. This intends to achieve compliance with clause a) and c) of Article 42;   Time stamps shall include the correct time. This is covered by clause a), b), and c) of  [EN 319 421] clause 7.7.1 and clause 7.7.2. This intends to achieve compliance with  clause b) of Article 42.  Regarding the secure issuance of the time stamp, following [EN 319 421], it shall be signed  using a key generated exclusively for this purpose. To that end, this key is stored in a time  stamping unit (TSU) that is defined as a set of hardware and software which is managed as a  unit and has a single time stamp signing key active at a time. [EN 319 421] specifies specific  requirements for the generation, protection, rekeying, and expiration of this TSU’s signing key in  clause 7.6.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  47  In particular, the TSU shall be trustworthy and comply with Article 24.2(e). For that purpose,  CEN issued [EN 419 231] to provide a protection profile dedicated to trustworthy systems  supporting time stamping.  3.5 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING QUALIFIED ELECTRONIC  REGISTERED DELIVERY SERVICES  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(36) an electronic registered delivery service as a  service that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by electronic means and  provides evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending  and receiving the data, and that protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage  or any unauthorised alterations.  In practice, the data referred to by that definition as being transmitted under such a service from  a sender to a receiver can be of any type, including electronic documents (initially created in  electronic form or dematerialised documents), structured or not. The transmission means can  be of any kind as well including but not limited to email. When the registered delivery service is  built on the formats, protocols and mechanisms used in ordinary e-mail messaging, the service  is called “registered electronic mail service” by the standard literature.  A qualified electronic registered delivery service (QERDS) is an electronic registered delivery  which meets the requirements laid down in Article 44 (cf. Article 3(37) of eIDAS). It should be  noted that a QERDS may directly transfer data from the sender to addressee or use (possibly a  network of) other QERDS services.  Figure 12: Requirements for QTSP providing qualified electronic registered delivery services  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation No N/A  Conformity assessment checklist No N/A  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  48  3.5.1 Article 44 (Qualified electronic registered delivery service)  Article 44.1 states that:  Qualified electronic registered delivery services shall meet the following requirements:  a) they are provided by one or more qualified trust service provider(s);  b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic  signature or an advanced electronic seal of a qualified trust service provider in  such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the data being changed  undetectably;  e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data  is clearly indicated to the sender and addressee of the data;  f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by  a qualified electronic time stamp.  In the event of the data being transferred between two or more qualified trust service  providers, the requirements in points (a) to (f) shall apply to all the qualified trust service  providers.  Regarding clause (a), the boundaries of qualified electronic registered delivery service are  established by a network of qualified trust service providers. QTSP should manage these  relationships and make sure that the entire “qualified electronic delivery network” it uses is  based on the services from qualified trust service providers, present in an eIDAS trusted list for  providing such kind of service.  Then, standards that are proposed by ETSI to TSP providing electronic registered delivery  services are:   [EN 319 521] “Policy and security requirements for Electronic Registered Delivery  Service Providers”;   [EN 319 522] multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Electronic  Registered Delivery Services;   [TS 119 524] multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance  and Interoperability of Electronic Registered Delivery Services;   [EN 319 531] “Policy and security requirements for Registered Electronic Mail Service  Providers”;   [EN 319 532] multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Registered  Electronic Mail Services;   [TS 119 534] multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance  and Interoperability of Registered Electronic Mail Services.  In particular, [EN 319 531] mostly rely on [EN 319 521] which defines specific provisions for  qualified electronic registered delivery services regarding the following aspects:   User content integrity and confidentiality in clauses 5.1;   User identification and authentication in clause 5.2;   Time reference in clause 5.3;   Events and evidence in clause 5.4.  3.6 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING REMOTE QSCD SERVICES  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(12) a qualified electronic signature as an advanced  electronic signature that is created by a qualified electronic signature creation device  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  49  [(QSCD36)], and which is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. The same  definition applies mutatis mutandis to a qualified electronic seal.  The Regulation also states through Recital(51) that it should be possible for the signatory (resp.  creator of the seal) to entrust QSCDs to the care of a third party, provided that appropriate  mechanisms and procedures are implemented to ensure that the signatory (resp. creator of the  seal) has sole control (resp. control) over the use of his electronic signature/seal creation data,  and the qualified electronic signature/seal requirements are met by the use of the device.  It is worth mentioning that a standard designed for signature and aiming thus to ascertain the  sole control, might be too severe for seal. To this regard, [TR 419 210] can be used to assess  what can or cannot be done when aiming to achieve a certain context of creation of the seal  (local versus remote (applicable to TSP), shared authentication, shared key, etc.) while  complying to these norms.  As stated in eIDAS Recital (52), in order to ensure that such electronic signatures[/seals]  receive the same legal recognition as electronic signature[/seals] created in an entirely user-  managed environment, remote electronic signature service providers should apply specific  management and administrative security procedures and use trustworthy systems and products.  For that purpose, remote QSCDs may only be provided by QTSPs.  It should also be noted that the management of a remote QSCD as a service is not a qualified  trust service per se but, as it shall be provided by a QTSP, this section proposes guidelines for  the provision of such a service (on top of the ones provided in Section 2) pursuant to the  objective of the present document to provide recommendations for QTSPs.  Following the definition of a QSCD, such a device shall meet the requirements laid down in  Annex II. Hence, its conformity to those requirements shall be certified according to Articles  30(1) and (3) for QSigCD or 39(2) for QSealCD.  Figure 13: Requirements for QTSP providing remote QSCD services  36 QSCD stands for both QSigCD and QSealCD. In case of ambiguity or necessity, the explicit acronym QSigCD or  QSealCD is used.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  50  3.6.1 Annex II and Articles 30 and 39 (Requirements and certification)  Pursuant to Annex II, the standard that is proposed by ETSI to QTSP providing service  components operating a remote QSCD is [TS 119 431-1] “Policy and security requirements for  trust service providers; Part 1: TSP service components operating a remote QSCD / SCDev”,  and in particular the EU SSASC37 policy (EUSCP) defined in this standard.  Pursuant to Article 30(3) and 39(2), the standards for the security assessment of information  technology products that apply to the certification of qualified electronic signature creation  devices or qualified electronic seal creation devices are laid down in [CID 2016/650].  However, at the time of drafting the [CID 2016/650], there were no available standards yet for  signing devices operated by a trust service provider generating or managing signature creation  data on behalf of the user to support the creation of qualified electronic signature / seals, and  the security assessment of products were performed via “alternative processes” as defined  under Article 30(3)b and as notified to the European Commission.  Since then, standards have been published by CEN to address the security assessment of such  signing devices38, namely:   [EN 419 241-2] “Trustworthy Systems Supporting Server Signing - Part 2: Protection  profile for QSCD for Server Signing”, which refers to [EN 419 241-1]39 “Trustworthy  Systems Supporting Server Signing - Part 1: General System Security Requirements”;  and   [EN 419 221-5] “Protection Profiles for TSP Cryptographic Modules - Part 5 –  Cryptographic Module for Trust Services”.  ENISA produced the report [Assessment of standards related to eIDAS] providing a description,  analysis, and assessment of the eligibility of the above-mentioned standards as being suitable  references in an amended version of [CID 2016/650]40 and concluded the importance that, on  top of those standards:   The TSP managing the Trustworthy Systems Supporting Server Signing follows [TS  119 431-1] (or equivalent);   The CA issuing the certificates follows [EN 319 411-1] (or equivalent);   For qualified devices management and qualified certificates issuance, the verification  that such requirements are followed, falls under supervision by the competent  supervisory bodies.  NOTE: It is worth noting the interrelation between the two. If the QTSP managing the  remote QSCD loses its qualified status because its “last” QTS loses its qualified status,  the remote QSCD may no longer be considered as a QSCD, although the device may  be listed in the European Commission’s Compilation of Member States notification on  SSCDs and QSCDs41 (the listing of such certified devices clearly states that a  condition for the listed device to be considered as QSCD is to be operated by a  QTSP). This has a direct impact on the QTSP issuing the qualified certificates for  which the private keys reside on this remote QSCD. The QSCD “status” of these  37 SSASCD stands for Server Signing Application Service Component.  38 The availability of new standards does not mean that Article 30.3(b) cannot be called anymore; this article still foresees  alternatives in the absence of referred standards to in point (a) of Article 30 or when a security evaluation process referred  to in point (a) is ongoing.  39 It is worth noting that [EN 419 241-1] specifies two assurance levels regarding the sole control on the key by the  signatory.  40 At the time of writing, the update of [CID 2016/650] is under discussion between the European Commission and the  Member States. No planning is publicly available.  41 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  51  qualified certificates may not be considered as correct anymore, and signatures  created with these private keys may no longer be considered as qualified.  The [Assessment of standards related to eIDAS] report is suggested for additional guidelines  relating to the standards listed in the present section. The report also provides, in Section 4.6  and reproduced here below, a figure illustrating how the elements of Annex II that apply in the  case where a QTSP manages the QSCDs are covered by existing standards:  Figure 14: Elements of eIDAS Annex II and applicability of the standards  Of particular interest are [CEN 419 221-5] and [ETSI TS 119 431-1] which further provide a  mapping between specific clauses and respectively Annex II requirements for the former,  elements of the eIDAS Recitals and Annex II requirements for the latter.

It is possible to use those trust services as well as electronic documents as evidence in legal  proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-border use. Courts (or  other bodies in charge of legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because  they are electronic but have to assess these electronic tools in the same way they would do for  their paper equivalent.  To further enhance the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in  the internal market, and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS  Regulation introduces the notions of qualified trust service (QTS) and qualified trust service  provider (QTSP) with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level  security and a higher presumption of their legal effect.  This document provides recommendations to help qualified trust service providers and auditors  understand the expected mapping between these requirements/obligations and reference  numbers of standards, as well as practical recommendations for their usage.  The document is structured in two main sections:   A section on “Requirements common to all QTSPs” that includes recommendations on  the requirements common to all TSPs and on the additional requirements common to  all QTSPs;   A section on “Requirements for provision of specific QTS”, to be used in addition to the  above, that includes specific recommendations for the provision of the qualified trust  services defined in eIDAS.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE ROLE OF ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity supports the European Commission and the  Member States on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations,  mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust  services and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic  identification (eIDs) included in the regulation.  ENISA also supports the national supervisory bodies in implementing their breach reporting by  aggregating their annual summary reports on trust service provider security breaches. The  Agency releases Annual Reports on Trust Services Security Incidents. Moreover, in a means to  support an efficient, effective process of reporting, the Agency has released the Visual Tool -  CIRAS to increase the transparency of cybersecurity incidents. The online tool is accessible to  the public.  1.2 BACKGROUND ON TRUST SERVICES PROVISIONING  Trust services and their provisioning are defined in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 (hereafter the  eIDAS Regulation, or eIDAS [eIDAS, 2014]), on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC.  Regarding the repealed Directive 1999/93/EC, Recital (3) of eIDAS states that it dealt with  electronic signatures without delivering a comprehensive cross-border and cross-sector  framework for secure, trustworthy, and easy-to-use electronic transactions. The eIDAS  Regulation has been implemented in such a way to enhance and expand the acquis of that  Directive to fill up this specific gap. In particular, as part of still ongoing work, this gap is and  should remain filled up thanks to a consistent and efficient mapping between the three following  frameworks:   Legal framework for trust services established by eIDAS and implementing acts. It  notably defines the requirements for provision of trust services and their legal effects,  in a way to remove barriers to their cross-border usage.   Standardisation framework1 provided by ETSI and CEN standardisation bodies and  relying on standards and “local” rules specified by other standardisation bodies such as  ISO, IETF, OASIS, UPU, and ITU. This framework aims to meet the general  requirements of the international community and eIDAS Regulation, to provide trust  and confidence in electronic transactions.   Trust framework established by eIDAS. This framework defines an ex ante and ex  post supervision model to supervise the compliance of QTSP and the QTS they  provide with the eIDAS requirements. The supervision model covers the full life cycle  of each QTS and each QTSP, from its genesis until its termination.  These frameworks, illustrated in Figure 1, are further covered in the next sections.  1 As covered in the remaining of the document, the eIDAS Regulation is technology-neutral. The legal effects it grants  should be achievable by any technical means provided that the requirements of this Regulation are met.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  6  Figure 1: Mapping between legal, standardisation, and trust frameworks  1.2.1 Legal Framework  The eIDAS Regulation establishes a general framework for the electronic identification of  natural and legal persons and for the use of trust services in the internal market.  One objective of this Regulation is to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the  internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products. To that end, the  Regulation introduces the notions of QTS and QTSP with a view to indicate their compliance  with the eIDAS high-level security requirements and obligations.  In particular, the eIDAS Regulation defines 9 types of QTSs:  1. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic signatures;  2. Provision of qualified certificates for electronic seals;  3. Provision of qualified certificates for website authentication;  4. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures ;  5. Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal;  6. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signature;  7. Qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seal;  8. Qualified time stamping service;  9. Qualified electronic registered delivery service.  A natural or legal person providing one or more of these QTSs and that is granted the qualified  status by the supervisory body (SB) is called a QTSP.  It is possible to use non-qualified and qualified trust services as well as electronic documents as  evidence in legal proceedings in all EU Member States contributing to their general cross-  border use. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal proceedings) cannot discard them as  evidence only because they are electronic but have to assess their validity in the same way they  would do for their paper equivalent.  When the provided trust service is qualified, the outputs of such services (e.g. qualified  certificate for electronic signature) can be used to achieve higher presumption of their legal  effects, e.g. equivalent legal effect of a qualified electronic signature and a handwritten  signature. For this purpose, the QTSP and the QTSs it provides (hereafter referred to as  “QTSP/QTS”) shall comply with high-level security requirements. These requirements are  covered in detail throughout the present document, along with recommendations for fulfilling  them based on standards introduced below in Section 1.2.3.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  7  1.2.2 Trust Framework  In line with the objective to enhance the trust of enterprises and consumers in the internal  market, eIDAS establishes an ex ante and ex post supervision model to supervise the  compliance of QTSP, and the QTS they provide with the eIDAS requirements. This supervision  model takes place:   At initiation, on regular basis, and at any time2 to ensure high-level security of  QTSs: When a TSP without qualified status intends to start providing QTS or when a  QTSP needs to confirm (as part of a regular assessment or an ad hoc audit) that the  QTS it provides fulfils the eIDAS requirements and obligations, the QTSP is audited by  an eIDAS-accredited conformity assessment body (CAB); The resulting conformity  assessment report is then submitted to the SB which later decides to grant or, if  applicable, to withdraw the qualified status of the TSP and the TS it provides;   At termination3 to ensure sustainability and durability of QTSs and to boost users’  confidence in the continuity of QTS: SBs should verify the existence and the correct  application of the provisions in the respective termination plans in cases where QTSPs  cease their activities.  This supervision model is the foundation of the trust framework as defined by eIDAS. It is  actually setting up a complete pyramid of trust for the QTSPs and the QTS(s) they provide, as  illustrated in the figure below:  Figure 2: eIDAS QTSP pyramid of trust  2 Initiation and supervision are further detailed in [ENISA Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified Trust Services] and [ENISA  Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust Services].  3 Termination is further detailed in [ENISA Guidelines on Termination of Trust Services Provision].  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  8  At the top of the QTSP pyramid of trust is the trusted list. A trusted list is a signed XML file  including information relating to the QTSPs which are established in and supervised by an EU  Member State, together with information related to the QTSs provided by them, in accordance  with the relevant provisions laid down in the eIDAS Regulation. Those lists have constitutive  value and are the primary source of information to validate that a qualified status has been  granted by the SB to a QTSP and to the QTS it provides. Trusted lists are essential elements in  building trust among electronic market operators by allowing users to determine the qualified  status and the status history of trust service providers and their services.  Finally, to clearly identify themselves from non-QTSP, and thus contributing to transparency in  the market, QTSPs can promote their QTSs by using the EU trust mark; The usage of this trust  mark furthermore enables users to fully benefit and consciously rely on electronic services, and  thereby boosts their confidence in and convenience of online services.  The obligations of the QTSP regarding this trust framework (Article 20, 21, and 24.2) and the  usage of the EU trust mark (Article 23) are further covered in the related sections of the present  document.  1.2.3 Standardisation Framework  1.2.3.1 Context  The requirements established by the eIDAS Regulation are technology-neutral: It should be  possible to achieve the necessary security requirements through different technologies.  Some articles of the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular those laying down requirements for the  QTSP/QTS, allow for referencing standards or specifications via implementing acts. Compliance  to these standards or specifications would provide a legal presumption of compliance with the  corresponding legal requirements. In other words, this would declare one “recognised” way of  implementing the requirements, but not the only way.  So far, no such optional implementing act has been adopted. It is clearly expected from the  industry to self-regulate as much as possible within the legal and trust framework provided by  the Regulation. A list of the possible implementing acts and the description of their scope may  be found in other ENISA Guidelines, in particular [ENISA Analysis of standards related to  TSPs].  1.2.3.2 ETSI/CEN Standardisation Framework  In late 2009, the European Commission issued Standardisation Mandate 4604 aiming at  supporting Directive 1999/93/EC. This Mandate requested CEN, CENELEC and ETSI to update  the existing electronic signature standardisation deliverables in view of establishing a fully  rationalised framework, which would solve the issues raised in actual use of electronic  signatures in the EU. After 2015, the activities under the Mandate were extended via the yearly-  updated EC Rolling Plan for ICT Standardisation5 to cope with the extension of scope brought  by the then-upcoming eIDAS Regulation.  The end result of these standardisation efforts (as part of a still ongoing work) is a coherent set  of standards for electronic signatures and related trust services, aimed to meet the general  requirements of the international community to provide trust and confidence in electronic  transactions, and in particular EU legislation regulatory requirements from the eIDAS  4 http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf  5https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation/electronic-identification-and-trust-services-including-e- signatures  http://www.etsi.org/images/files/ECMandates/m460.pdf https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation/electronic-identification-and-trust-services-including-e-signatures https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation/electronic-identification-and-trust-services-including-e-signatures  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  9  Regulation6. For this reason, the present document focuses on this ETSI/CEN framework and is  based on the above-mentioned set of standards.  It is worth noting that this ETSI/CEN framework is standardising requirements for a PKI-based  implementation of QTSP/QTS and so is not technology agnostic: All documents of the  framework intend to cover digital signatures supported by PKI and public key certificates. A  digital signature is defined in ETSI ESI standards as “data appended to, or being a  cryptographic transformation of a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the  source and integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery”. When appropriately supported  by relevant trust services, digital signatures can support the implementation of trust services  outputs (e.g. electronic signatures, electronic seals, timestamps etc.) as they are defined in the  eIDAS Regulation. Because of this PKI-based orientation, these standards provide less  guidance (or possibly no guidance at all) for “alternative”, “innovative” or “creative”  implementations (e.g. blockchain-based timestamps) of the eIDAS requirements. In the latter  cases, the TSP may have to transpose the standardised practices and controls.  It is also worth noting that ETSI standards are not meant to be EU-only standards but  international standards that may be used in EU specific purposes and benefit to other non-EU  purposes aiming to reach the same level of best practices.  Structure of the framework  ETSI technical report [TR 119 000] describes the general structure for ETSI/CEN digital  signature standardisation, outlining existing and potential standards for such signatures,  referred to as the ETSI/CEN framework for standardisation of signatures.  As stated in [TS 119 100], to identify a single and consistent series of digital signatures  standards and with the aim to keep the same number for each document whatever maturity  level it reaches through its lifetime, a consistent numbering has been defined as DD L19 xxx-z  where:   DD indicates the deliverable type in the standardisation process (SR, TS, TR and EN);   L=4 identifies CEN deliverables and L=0-3 identified ETSI deliverables;   19 indicates the series of standardisation documents related to electronic signatures;   xxx indicates the serial number and -z identifies multi-parts as some documents may  be multi-part documents.  Regarding the above-mentioned serial number, this framework identifies six areas (identified with  Xxx) of standardisation with a list of existing and potential future standards in each area, as  illustrated in Figure 3.  6 https://portal.etsi.org/TB-SiteMap/ESI/ESI-ToR  https://portal.etsi.org/TB-SiteMap/ESI/ESI-ToR  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  10  Figure 3: Overview of ETSI/CEN standardisation framework  These areas are:  1. Introductory deliverables: gathering the overview document [ETSI TR 119 000] as  well as common definitions, studies, and other introductory deliverables related to the  framework for standardisation of signatures.  2. Signature creation and validation: focusing on standards related to the creation,  augmentation, and validation of digital signatures, covering:  a. the policy and security requirements for signature creation applications and  signature validation applications;  b. the expression of rules and procedures to be followed at creation, verification  and for preservation of digital signatures for long term;  c. signature format, packaging of signatures and signed documents; and  d. protection profiles, according to Common Criteria for signature  creation/verification applications.  3. Signature creation and other related devices: focusing on standards related to  qualified signature/seal creation devices as defined in eIDAS, on signature creation  devices used by trust service providers as well as other types of devices supporting  digital signatures and related services such as authentication. In practice, the  deliverables of this area have been produced by CEN, particularly the protection  profiles referred to in the present document.  4. Cryptographic suites: covering standardisation aspects related to the use of  signature cryptographic suites, i.e. the suite of digital signature related algorithms  including key generation algorithms, signing algorithms with parameters and padding  method, verification algorithms, and hash functions.  5. Trust service providers supporting digital signatures and related services:  covering QTSPs issuing qualified certificates, TSPs issuing public key certificates other  than qualified certificates, including certificates for website authentication, time-  stamping services providers, TSPs offering signature validation services, TSPs offering  remote signature creation services (also called signing servers).  6. Trust application service providers: covering trust service providers offering value  added services applying digital signatures and relying on the generation/validation of  electronic signatures in normal operation. This includes namely registered mail and  other e-delivery services, as well as data preservation (long term archiving) services.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  11  7. Trust service status (list) provider: covering standards related to the provision of  trusted lists as specified by [CID 2015/1505].  Up to five types of documents may be associated with each area:   Guidance documents;   Policy and Security Requirements;   Technical Specifications;   Conformance Assessment Guidance;   Compliance and Interoperability Testing.  More information on the ETSI/CEN standardisation framework may be found in [ETSI TR 119  000].

The two figures below illustrate this structure for the issuance of qualified certificates and  qualified time stamps.  Source: ETSI European standardisation framework for trust services  Figure 4: ETSI standards regarding issuance of qualified certificates  Figure 5: ETSI standards regarding issuance of qualified timestamps  The standards listed in the figures above provide guidance and set requirements regarding the  operations of the QTSP/QTS. Other standards from ETSI may be referred in these documents,  either as normative reference or as guidance for implementations.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  13  Examples of these standards include:   Cryptographic suites: [TS 119 312];   Signature formats: ETSI EN 319 1x2;   Protection profiles regarding cryptographic modules, server signing, timestamping :  CEN EN 419 221 series, [EN 419 241-2], [EN 419 231];   Accessibility requirements: [EN 301 549].  Where appropriate, these standards are referred to in the sections below covering eIDAS  requirements.  1.2.3.3 Standards from other standardisation bodies  Other standardisation bodies such as ISO, IETF, OASIS, UPU, ITU, and national accreditation  or supervisory bodies are also defining “standards” or “local rules” that apply to Trust Services  and Trust Service Providers.  These “standards” and “local rules” are usually indicated in the ETSI/CEN standards as the  basis for the specific requirements or further guidance and implementation recommendations,  with the aim of further clarifying or supplementing these base standards in order to maximise  best practices, interoperability, and suitability to trust services.  References in ETSI standards to standards from other standardisation bodies include:   Standard(s) regarding due diligence and risk management such as [ISO/IEC 27002]  providing guidelines for information security practices and [ISO/IEC 27005] for  guidance on information security risk management as part of an information security  management system (ISMS) as defined by [ISO/IEC 27001];   Standard(s) regarding management of personal data (e.g. [ISO/IEC 27701]);   CA/Browser Forum (hereafter referred to as “CA/B Forum”) requirements, designed by  a voluntary group of certification authorities (CAs), vendors of Internet browser  software, and suppliers of other applications that use X.509 digital certificates for  SSL/TLS and code signing8. CA/B Forum work includes:  o Baseline requirements for the issuance and management of publicly trusted  certificates;  o EV SSL certificate guidelines;  o EV code signing certificate guidelines;  o Network and certificate systems security requirements.  A QTSP looking to be included in the browsers root stores may be interested in the  recommendations provided in Section 3.1.1.4.   Family of standards to the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure provided by IETF such as  [RFC 5280];   SOG-IS9 Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms to help ensure a high level of security in  the recommended cryptographic suites, in particular when creating and validating  digital signatures. ETSI standards such as [TS 119 312] on “Cryptographic Suites”  notably delegate the assessment of the security of underlying cryptographic schemes  to this document. Both documents are revised every two years and, in the case of new  attacks or of the immediate need to remove an algorithm could arise, a revision of [TS  119 312] is published as soon as possible.  8 Requirements for S/MIME certificates are expected to be published in the near future  9 https://www.sogis.eu/.

This document can also be used by auditors assessing (Q)TSPs, e.g. CABs, or Supervisory  Bodies, looking for a mapping between the eIDAS requirements and reference numbers of  standards, on which a (Q)TSP may rely.  1.4 PURPOSE AND STRUCTURE OF THIS DOCUMENT  This document provides recommendations to help stakeholders in understanding the expected  mapping between the eIDAS requirements and reference numbers of standards, as well as  practical recommendations for their usage. In the remainder of this document, unless stated  otherwise, a reference of an “Article” indicates an article of the eIDAS Regulation.  This document is an updated version of “Recommendations for QTSPs based on standards –  Technical guidelines on trust services”, published in December 2017, refreshed with standards  that have been published and updated since. The document is also based on the ENISA  deliverable from 2015 “Analysis of standards related to Trust Service Providers – Mapping of  requirements of eIDAS to existing standards”.  This document is structured as follows:   Section 2 “Requirements common to all QTSPs” that includes:  1. Recommendations on the requirements common to all TSPs (both QTSPs  and non-QTSPs), namely requirements on data processing and protection  (Article 5), on liability and burden of proof (Article 13), on accessibility for  persons with disabilities (Article 15), and on security (Article 19);  2. Recommendations on the additional requirements common to all QTSPs, as  required by Article 20, 21, 23, and Article 24.2 of eIDAS.   Section 3 “Requirements for provision of specific QTS”, to be used in addition to the  above common requirements, that includes specific recommendations for the provision  of the qualified trust services defined in eIDAS:  1. QTSP issuing qualified certificates for electronic signatures, electronic seals,  and website authentication;  2. QTSP providing qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures  (QESig) and/or qualified electronic seal (QESeal);  3. QTSP providing qualified preservation service for QESig/QESeal;  4. QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamping service;  5. QTSP providing qualified electronic registered delivery service;  6. QTSP providing remote QSCD services (i.e. generating or managing  electronic signature creation data on behalf of the signatory). This service is  not a qualified trust service per se but, as it shall be provided by a QTSP,  recommendations are proposed pursuant to the objective of the document to  provide recommendations for QTSPs.  This document structure is illustrated in the following figure.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  15  Figure 6: Recommendations for QTSP based on standards  1.5 DISCLAIMER  Due to the technological neutrality of the eIDAS requirements, it is worth noting that:   Different approaches based on different technologies than the ones exposed in the  present document can lead to eIDAS compliance;   Compliance against these standards (or other standards) is not mandatory to achieve  compliance against eIDAS requirements;   Compliance against these standards does not automatically imply conformance to  eIDAS requirements. Although these standards may be seen as best practices, there is  no automatic presumption of compliance10  to eIDAS after following the said standards.  10 Some nationally-defined schemes (e.g. [ANSSI, 2017], [NSA-CS], [DKPv2]) specify conformity criteria based on the ETSI  standards, along with a limited set of additional requirements, that provide presumption of compliance to the eIDAS  requirements.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  16  2. REQUIREMENTS COMMON TO  ALL QTSPS  In order to ensure due diligence, inclusion, transparency, and accountability of the operations  and services of QTSPs, all of them are subject to a common set of requirements:   As a TSP:  o Data processing and protection, as defined in Article 5;  o Liability and burden of proof, as defined in Article 13.2;  o Accessibility for persons with disabilities, as defined in Article 15;  o Security, as defined in Article 19.1 and 19.2.   As a QTSP:  o Specific requirements regarding initiation and supervision, as defined in  Articles 20 and 21;  o Specific requirements on the usage of the EU trust mark, as defined in Article  23;  o Specific requirements on the operations per se of a QTSP, as defined in  Article 24.2 (excluding Article 24.2(k) specific to the issuance of qualified  certificates).  This section details guidelines for QTSPs based on standards for the purpose of being  compliant with the above-mentioned requirements.  Figure 7: Requirements common to all QTSPs  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  17  2.1 ARTICLE 5 (DATA PROTECTION)  Article 5 states that:  1. Processing of personal data shall be carried out in accordance with Directive  95/46/EC.  2. Without prejudice to the legal effect given to pseudonyms under national law, the use  of pseudonyms in electronic transactions shall not be prohibited.  It is important to highlight that the Directive 95/46/EC is now replaced by the Regulation (EU)  2016/679 of 27 April 201611 on \"the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing  of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC\",  known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The ETSI standardisation framework addresses this Article with the requirement REQ-7.13-05  of [EN 319 401]. However, the mentioned requirement does not contain detailed information on  how to meet GDPR except that, regarding “the authentication for a service online, the  processing of identification data shall be limited to only those data which are adequate, relevant  and not excessive to grant access to that service online”.  Compliance to GDPR (and associated guidance) is a subject on its own and is thus outside of  the scope of the present document. Further information on this topic may be found for instance  in ENISA documents specific to the subject: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection.  In terms of standards, [ISO/IEC 27701] is an extension of [ISO/IEC 27001] for Privacy  Information, extending an ISMS (Information Security Management System) into a PIMS  (Privacy Information Management System). [ISO/IEC 27701] may be seen as a framework for  managing data privacy, and so may be seen as a tool to reach compliance to GDPR,  demonstrating that the TSP is “in control” regarding data privacy. It is worth noting that being  certified against [ISO/IEC 27701] is by no means a presumption of compliance to GDPR, and  similarly that GDPR does not mandate the certification or the compliance to the [ISO/IEC 27701]  standard.  Finally, it is worth mentioning that, in order to be useful in the context of demonstrating  compliance with Article 5, the scope of [ISO/IEC 27701] certification (the same applies for  [ISO/EC 27001] certification) should explicitly address the provision of the QTS(s) provided by  the QTSP.  2.2 ARTICLE 13.2 (LIABILITY AND BURDEN OF PROOF)  Article 13.2 states that:  Where trust service providers duly inform their customers in advance of the  limitations on the use of the services they provide and where those limitations are  recognisable to third parties, trust service providers shall not be liable for damages  arising from the use of services exceeding the indicated limitations.  The ETSI standardisation framework addresses this Article with the requirement REQ-6.2-01 of  [EN 319 401] that requires TSPs to make clear terms and conditions available to all subscribers  and relying parties, and in particular pay attention to REQ-6.2-02 items f) and g) of [EN 319 401]  11 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive  95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). Available at https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/data-protection https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  18  so that these terms and conditions state any possible limitation of liability together with the  applicable legal system.  2.3 ARTICLE 15 (ACCESSIBILITY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES)  Article 15 states that:  Where feasible, trust services provided and end-user products used in the provision  of those services shall be made accessible for persons with disabilities.  The ETSI standardisation framework addresses this Article with the requirements REQ-7.13-03  and REQ-7.13-04 of [EN 319 401]. In particular this standard recommends taking into account  [EN 301 549], that specifies the functional accessibility requirements applicable to ICT products  and services, together with a description of the test procedures and evaluation methodology for  each accessibility requirement.  In practice, pragmatic ways of implementing Article 15 may include the setup of alternative ways  to reach the same objectives (e.g. a dedicated support line that persons with disabilities may  call if they experience difficulties with a webpage delivering the said product or service, so that  they may be guided efficiently through the same procedure).  2.4 ARTICLES 19.1 AND 19.2 (SECURITY REQUIREMENTS)  Article 19.1 states that:  Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall take appropriate technical  and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust  services they provide. Having regard to the latest technological developments, those  measures shall ensure that the level of security is commensurate to the degree of  risk. In particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of  security incidents and inform stakeholders of the adverse effects of any such  incidents.  Article 19.2 states that:  Qualified and non-qualified trust service providers shall, without undue delay but in  any event within 24 hours after having become aware of it, notify the supervisory  body and, where applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the competent national  body for information security or the data protection authority, of any breach of  security or loss of integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided  or on the personal data maintained therein.  Where the breach of security or loss of integrity is likely to adversely affect a natural  or legal person to whom the trusted service has been provided, the trust service  provider shall also notify the natural or legal person of the breach of security or loss  of integrity without undue delay.  [Other requirements for the supervisory body]  Article 19 requires that all TSPs:  1. Assess risks. This obligation is addressed in clause 5 of [EN 319 401], summarizing  the five important steps for risk assessment, along with references to [ISO/IEC 27005]  and information security policy specified in the clause 6.3;  2. Take appropriate security measures. [EN 319 401] and the other ETSI policy standards  (related to provision of specific QTS) propose security measures that should be taken  by the QTSP. For instance, appropriate security measures for all (Q)TSPs are defined  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  19  in clauses 7.2 to 7.12 of [EN 319 401] that are all subclauses from clause 7 on “TSP  management and operation”, excluding clause 7.1 on “Internal organization” and  clause 7.13 on “Compliance” that are not related to security per se;  3. Notify the supervisory body about significant security incidents and breaches of  integrity. To that end, ENISA released an incident reporting framework for eIDAS  Article 19 in [ENISA Article 19 Incident reporting].  The implementation of this article and details on the three above activities are specifically  covered by the [ENISA Security Framework for QTSPs]. This document proposes a security  framework for QTSPs, on top of the one proposed for TSPs in [ENISA Security Framework for  TSPs], taking into account the type of provided QTSs, regarding policies, procedures, and  processes in order to be compliant with the security requirements defined in eIDAS under  aforementioned articles.  2.5 ARTICLES 20 AND 21 (SUPERVISION AND INITIATION)  Article 20 “Supervision of qualified trust service providers” and Article 21 “Initiation of a qualified  trust service” may be seen as not related to the core operations of a QTSP. However, they lay  down the foundation of a supervision scheme where the QTSP has an active participation, and  as such define clear requirements towards this QTSP.  On this specific topic of initiation, supervision (and termination), ENISA published a series of  deliverables whose objective is to propose guidelines aimed at facilitating the implementation of  the provisions related to it. These deliverables state:  In order to ensure high-level security of qualified trust services, the eIDAS Regulation  foresees an active supervision scheme of QTSP/QTS by the national competent SB  that supervises, ex ante and ex post, fulfilment of the QTSP/QTS requirements and  obligations.  Before a TSP/TS is granted a qualified status (becoming a QTSP/QTS), it will be  subject to a pre-authorisation process – the so-called initiation process in line with  Article 21 of the eIDAS Regulation. QTSP may only begin to provide the QTS after the  qualified status has been granted by the national SB and indicated in the national  trusted list as referred to in Article 22 of the Regulation. From there, the supervision  scheme covers the full life cycle of each QTS and each QTSP, from its genesis until its  termination.  The first deliverable of the above-mentioned series, [ENISA Guidelines on Initiation of Qualified  Trust Services], proposes detailed guidelines pursuant to Article 21.  The guidelines continue with:  Once granted a qualified status, QTSPs and their QTSs have the obligation to pass,  and submit to the competent supervisory body a conformity assessment report (CAR)  issued by an accredited CAB confirming at least every 24 months, that the QTSP and  the QTSs it provides fulfil the requirements laid down in the Regulation. Competent  supervisory bodies are also allowed, at their own discretion and at any time, to audit  themselves any QTSP/QTS for which they are competent or to request an accredited  CAB to perform an ad hoc audit.  The second deliverable of the above-mentioned series, [ENISA Guidelines on Supervision of  Qualified Trust Services], proposes detailed guidelines pursuant to Article 20.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  20  Finally, the guidelines state that:  To ensure sustainability and durability of QTS, and proper termination and user’s  confidence in the continuity of QTS, QTSPs have to maintain an up-to-date termination  plan, as referred to in Article 24.2(i) of the Regulation.  The third deliverable of the above-mentioned series, [ENISA Guidelines on Termination of  Qualified Trust Services], proposes detailed guidelines pursuant to Article 24.2(i). Related  recommendations can also be found in Section 2.7.9 of the present document.  With regards to conformity audits aiming to confirm that the assessed (Q)TSP/QTS fulfil the  requirements of eIDAS, [ENISA conformity assessment of qualified trust service providers]  provides an overview of the conformity assessment framework for (Q)TSPs in the context of this  Regulation. This document can be used, for each phase of an eIDAS conformity assessment,  as guidance to QTSPs for the purpose of preparing and undertaking the assessment in the best  possible conditions.  2.6 ARTICLE 23 (EU TRUST MARK)  Article 23 states that:  1. After the qualified status […] has been indicated in the trusted list […], qualified trust  service providers may use the EU trust mark to indicate in a simple, recognisable,  and clear manner the qualified trust services they provide.  2. When using the EU trust mark for the qualified trust services referred to in paragraph  1, qualified trust service providers shall ensure that a link to the relevant trusted list is  made available on their website.  The purpose of this trust mark is to identify the QTSP/QTS and clearly differentiate them from  non-qualified trust services provided by non-QTSP. The objective behind the specification of  this trust mark is to boost confidence and convenience of online services that are essential for  users to fully benefit and consciously rely on electronic services.  Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the use of an EU trust mark by QTSPs is on a  voluntary basis.  The usage of the trust mark does not lead to any requirement other than those provided in the  eIDAS Regulation and CID 2015/806 laying down its specifications (such as size and design)  pursuant to Article 23(3). In order to help QTSP properly using this trust mark, the Commission  published12 explanations, practical guidance, and logos.  Regarding clause 2 of Article 23, as alternatives to a link to the XML version of the trusted list,  the QTSP may provide a link to the Trusted List Browser tool13 provided by the European  Commission. It enables any interested party to browse the EU trusted lists (and the information  related to that QTSP) in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, unlike a trusted list location that is  subject to change over time, a link to above-mentioned tool ensures to always redirect the  interested party to a representation of the trusted list downloaded from the last location notified  by the Member State to the Commission. To that end, the QTSP can either provide a link to:  1. A browsable version of the national trusted list, using https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-  browser/#/tl/CC where CC is the relevant applicable country code in two letters;  12 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-trust-mark  13 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-trust-mark https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  21  2. A browsable version of the QTSP information, including the qualified trust services it  provides, using https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/trustmark/CC/VATCC-  NUMBER where both CC should be replaced by the country code in two letters, and  NUMBER is the VAT Number provided in the trusted list as one of the trade names of  that QTSP14.  Both links (1) & (2) satisfy Article 23(2) and as such can be used in conjunction with the EU trust  mark for an improved user experience.  2.7 ARTICLE 24.2 (REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP)  Article 24.2 of eIDAS Regulation specifies 10 clauses for QTSPs providing QTSs. The following  subsections 24.2(a) to 24.2(j) refer to each of these clauses and propose guidelines based on  standards for compliance with them.  Article 24.2(k) is specific to QTSPs issuing qualified certificates and is covered in Section 3.1.3.  2.7.1 Article 24.2(a) (Notification of changes)  Article 24.2(a) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  inform the supervisory body of any change in the provision of its qualified trust  services and an intention to cease those activities  This article specifies that the QTSP shall inform the SB of:   Changes in provided QTS;   Its intent to terminate providing a QTS.  Implementation of this article is tightly related to the change management process. One of the  main goals of such a process is to introduce changes in a systematic, secure, and effective  manner.  The present document recommends that the reporting mechanism should provide event driven  triggers (according to threshold criteria: \"when to notify”) and communication channels (“how to  notify”) to report changes to a SB according to Member State regulations. It is a good practice to  create a communication plan associated with the change management process which covers  communication with a supervisory body.  ETSI standards do not impose any specific requirements or rules related to communication.  However, it is recommended that such rules should be defined and information about them be  included in the Trust Service Practice Statement (or the other practice statements such as the  Certification Practice Statement for the issuance of qualified certificates).  For changes made in the above-mentioned practice statements, [EN 319 401] specifies:   The TSP shall notify notice of changes it intends to make in its practice statement  (REQ-6.1-09); and   The TSP shall, following approval […], make the revised TSP's practice statement  immediately available […] (REQ-6.1-10).  For other changes (those not reflected in a practice statement), the present document suggests  to keep the same communication rules as above, with the exception that, when the QTSP  14 E.g. https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/trustmark/BE/VATBE-0408425626 to point to Zetes S.A./N.V. in the  trusted list of Belgium.  https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tl-browser/#/trustmark/BE/VATBE-0408425626  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  22  intends to terminate its activities, it should be communicated to the SB earlier (than in the actual  termination process).  Further guidance on notification of changes under Article 24.2(a) may be found in the [ENISA  Guidelines on Supervision of Qualified Trust Services]. Best practices regarding the change  management process can be found in chapter 12.1.2 of [ISO/IEC 27002] standard.  Regarding the specificities of termination activities, the second part of Article 24.2(a)  (information of the intention to cease activities), is covered by clause 7.12 of [EN 319 401]  which is required to be applied before the TSP terminates its services. Guidelines on these  termination activities are covered in further detail below in the section on Article 24(i)  (termination plan).  2.7.2 Article 24.2(b) (Human resources)  Article 24.2(b) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  employ staff and, if applicable, subcontractors who possess the necessary expertise,  reliability, experience, and qualifications and who have received appropriate training  regarding security and personal data protection rules and shall apply administrative  and management procedures which correspond to European or international  standards;  QTSP should build an appropriate organization structure. Staff with good knowledge,  segregation of duties and sufficient funds for maintaining this staff is a part of building QTSPs  reliability. QTSP should develop and maintain appropriate human resources processes and  procedures, education programs and keep records of such activities.  These measures should ensure:   Reliability and competence of candidates for employment;   Continuous personal education for staff and management;   Trainings sessions;   Security procedures trainings;   Sufficient human resources of the TSP to fulfil requirements of segregation of duty,  business requirements and implement countermeasures resulting from risk analysis;   Appropriate discipline;   Proper record keeping of these activities.  General requirements (applicable to any TSP) aiming to help TSPs comply with this clause are  set by clause 7.2 of [EN 319 401]. For detailed provisions, this standard refers to [ISO/IEC  27002]. In particular, best practices regarding human resources security, security roles and  responsibility and segregation of duties are described in clauses 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and 7 of [ISO/IEC  27002].  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to these  additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the following table.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  23  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates [EN 319 411-1] Clause 6.4.4  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441] OVR-7.13-04  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  - -  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps - -  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521] Clause 7.2.2  2.7.3 Article 24.2(c) (Liability and financial resources)  Article 24.2(c) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  with regard to the risk of liability for damages in accordance with Article 13, maintain  sufficient financial resources and/or obtain appropriate liability insurance, in  accordance with national law;  There is no ETSI standard defining how to meet this requirement; this is an identified gap in  standardisation. This matter is only referred to in [EN 319 401] via REQ-7.1.1-04, with no more  guidance than in the Regulation, but replacing “national law” by “applicable law”.  The gap can be addressed by extension to the requirement of the above-mentioned REQ, to  recommend that the assessment of “maintain sufficient financial resources and/or obtain  appropriate liability insurance” should be a risk-based approach, i.e. based on a risk  assessment, which takes into account commercial and financial issues, following local (national)  rules and legislation (if any) and good practices, as part of the risk management. Further  guidance on risk management is provided in the [ENISA Security Framework for QTSPs].  The most common approach towards the treatment of a risk of liabilities for damage is risk  sharing, and the most common countermeasure is insurance against the risks. A QTSP should  check the legislation related to the protection of consumers (subscribers) and trusting entities  interests, in the Member State in which it operates or would like to start its activities.  If a regulator expects a TSP to declare an amount of liabilities, it is the most cost effective to  establish a risk management process. The analysis of threats and potential losses per service  allows a TSP to calculate an amount of money to allocate to assure compensation for potential  damages or define insurance requirements and conditions.  2.7.4 Article 24.2(d) (Terms and conditions)  Article 24.2(d) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  before entering into a contractual relationship, inform, in a clear and comprehensive  manner, any person seeking to use a qualified trust service of the precise terms and  conditions regarding the use of that service, including any limitations on its use;  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  24  Use of trust services by subscribers and trusting entities requires notice or knowledge of the  terms and conditions of these services. One of QTSP’s obligations is to inform about terms and  conditions for each trust service. Information presented in the documentation should be up to  date, understandable, easily accessible, and conspicuously communicated to stakeholders.  Clause 6.2 of [EN 319 401] defines general requirements for the content of the terms and  conditions.  When relying parties need to acknowledge the terms and conditions, the good practice  proposed in the present document is the setup of an acceptance method, such as a mandatory  acceptance button together with the necessity to scroll down (i.e. “read”) the whole content.  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to these  additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  [EN 319 411-1]  Clause 6.9.4  DIS-6.1-04 to  DIS-6.1-09  REG-6.3.4-02 to  REG-6.3.4-03  OVR-6.3.4-04 to  OVR-6.3.4-06  [EN 319 411-2] Clause 6.9.4  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441] Clause 6.2  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511] Clause 6.2  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps [EN 319 421] Clause 6.6  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521] Clause 4.2  2.7.5 Article 24.2(e) (Trustworthy systems)  Article 24.2(e) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  use trustworthy systems and products that are protected against modification and  ensure the technical security and reliability of the processes supported by them;  There is no clear definition of “trustworthy systems” and “trustworthy products”. First,  “trustworthiness” can actually be defined differently depending on the type of the service.  Second, such systems and products can also be certified or not certified and hardware-based or  software-based.  In addition, it is worth noting that this clause does not relate only to trustworthy systems and  products that appear in dedicated QTSP-related processes (e.g. generation and storage of  cryptographic keys), but are also related to storage of data and supporting processes such as  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  25  “supplier service delivery management” or “system acquisition, development, and maintenance  management”.  Article 24.2(e) is explicitly covered by the set of requirements defined in clause 7.7 of [ETSI 319  401]. This article is also implicitly covered in this standard by:   Clause 7.5 on cryptographic control, in case the QTSP makes use of cryptographic  keys or devices;   Clause 7.6 on physical and environmental security, and in particular for components  whose security is critical to the provision of the trust service(s) and minimize risks  related to physical security;   Clause 7.4 on the limitation of QTSP's system access to authorized individuals (and in  particular REQ-7.4-02, REQ-7.4-03, and REQ-7.4-10 in the context of Article 24.2(e));   Clause 7.8 on the network and related systems security.  These clauses refer to [ISO/IEC 27002] and [CA/B Forum network security guide] for additional  guidance.  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to these  additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  [EN 319 411-1] Clause 6.5  [EN 319 411-2] Clause 6.5  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441]  Clause 7.5  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.7  Clause 7.8  Clause 8  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511]  Clause 7.5  Clause 7.8  PRP-8.1-01 and  PRP-8.1-03  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps [EN 319 421]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.8  Clause 7.10  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521]  Clause 7.5  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.8  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  26  In accordance with [EN 319 411-2], for QTSPs issuing qualified certificates, it is worth noting  that the generation of TSP’s key pair shall be carried out within a trustworthy system which:  a) is assured to EAL 4 or higher in accordance with [ISO/IEC 15408], or equivalent  national or internationally recognized evaluation criteria for IT security provided this is a  security target or protection profile which meets the requirements of the above-  mentioned standards; or  b) meet the requirements identified in [ISO/IEC 19790] or [FIPS PUB 140-2] level 3.  The same applies for QTSP issuing qualified time stamps regarding the generation of the  timestamping unit signing key (cf. [EN 319 421].  Regarding clause a) (on EAL 4 and [ISO/IEC 15408]), CEN EN 419 221 series of standards are  dedicated to the specification of common criteria protection profiles for TSP's cryptographic  modules, in accordance with [ISO/IEC 15408]. For QTSP issuing qualified time stamps and as  further detailed in Section 3.4, CEN published [EN 419 231], i.e. protection profile for  “trustworthy systems supporting time stamping”.  Regarding QSCD, and according to Article 30 and 39 of eIDAS, when a qualified certificate  relies on a QSCD15, this QSCD shall be certified against the requirements laid down in Annex II  of eIDAS; notified by the Member States to the European Commission; and published by the  Commission16. With regards to the certification of local QSCDs, [CID 2016/650] lays down the  list of standards to be used as part of their security assessment (i.e. the CEN EN 419 211  series)17.  The particular case of remote QSCDs (when the electronic signature/seal creation data is  managed on behalf of the signatory/creator of seal) is covered in Section 3.1 “Requirements for  QTSP issuing qualified certificates” and Section 3.6 “Requirements for QTSP providing remote  QSCD services ”.  2.7.6 Article 24.2(f) (Data storage)  Article 24.2(f) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  use trustworthy systems to store data provided to it, in a verifiable form so that:  i) they are publicly available for retrieval only where the consent of the person to  whom the data relates has been obtained,  ii) only authorised persons can make entries and changes to the stored data,  iii) the data can be checked for authenticity;  This article expands Article 24.2(e) by additional aspects concerning personal data handling. As  a consequence, the references to standards in Section 2.7.5 also applies to the present section.  Personal data is part of the sensitive information a QTSP acquires during standard operations.  Personal data protection is covered in Section 2.1 related to Article 5 on data processing and  15 The private key related to a qualified certificate does not necessarily need to be stored on a QSCD. But being protected  by a QSCD is requirement for a qualified electronic signature (as defined in eIDAS Article 3(12).  16 The list of SSCD and QSCD is currently published in https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member- states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  17 “Alternative processes” as defined in Article 30.3(b) might still be used in the case where the standards listed in Article  30.3(a) are considered as not applicable. This is demonstrated (at the time of writing of the present document) by the  alternative process notified by the Netherlands and described in https://www.tuv-nederland.nl/assets/files/general- files/2019/12/190724-trn-eidas-dutch-conformity-assessment-process---v5.0.pdf. This alternative process explicitly covers  “Type 1 QSCDs” that cannot claim conformance to the CEN EN 419 211 series.

Depending on the type of services provided, Section 2.7.10 on Article 24.2(j)  provides additional guidelines in that respect.  Additionally, depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards  refine and extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to  these additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  (in addition to the ones mentioned above)  [EN 319 411-1]  Clause 6.4.3  Clause 6.4.6  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441]  Clause 7.13  Clause 7.5  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511] Clause 7.5  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps - -  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521] Clause 5.1  2.7.7 Article 24.2(g) (Measures against forgery and theft of data)  Article 24.2(g) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  take appropriate measures against forgery and theft of data;  Measures against forgery and theft of data shall warrant particular attention when the QTSP  takes appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the  security of the trust services it provides as required by Article 19 (see Section 2.4).  It is recommended in the present document that such measures must be considered in nearly  all the aspects of the QTSP management and operations, and in particular the ones listed in  [EN 319 401] such as:   Human resources (clause 7.2);   Asset management (clause 7.3);   Access control (clause 7.4);   Cryptographic controls (clause 7.5);   Physical and environmental security (clause 7.6);   Operation security (clause 7.7);   Network security (clause 7.8);   Incident management (clauses 7.9);   Collection of evidence (clause 7.10);   Business continuity management (clause 7.11);   In case of termination (clause 7.12).  Measures derived from the above clauses can be expanded with the catalogue of available  ones in [ISO/IEC 27002], which is indeed referred to by the ETSI standards when applicable.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  28  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend the related measures. Where applicable, a reference to these additional measures may  be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates  [EN 319 411-1]  Clause 6.4  Clause 6.5  [EN 319 411-2]  Clause 6.4  Clause 6.5  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 441]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.7  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.7  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps [EN 319 421] Clause 7.8  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521]  Clause 7.6  Clause 7.8  2.7.8 Article 24.2(h) (Records)  Article 24.2(h) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  record and keep accessible for an appropriate period of time, including after the  activities of the qualified trust service provider have ceased, all relevant information  concerning data issued and received by the qualified trust service provider, in  particular, for the purpose of providing evidence in legal proceedings and for the  purpose of ensuring continuity of the service. Such recording may be done  electronically;  This requirement should be read together with Article 17.4(i):  […] the tasks of the supervisory body shall include in particular:  to verify the existence and correct application of provisions on termination plans in  cases where the qualified trust service provider ceases its activities, including how  information is kept accessible in accordance with point (h) of Article 24(2);  The preservation and accessibility for an appropriate period of time, including after the activities  of the QTSP have ceased, of all relevant information concerning data issued and received by  the QTSP are essential. It is in particular required for the purpose of providing evidence in legal  proceedings (e.g. audit on data collection and treatment), GDPR legal compliance, and for the  purpose of ensuring continuity of the service.  In that sense, it should still be possible to validate previous evidence created as part of the  qualified trust service or by means of its outputs. This may not require, except for the issuance  of qualified certificates, that the QTSP makes a copy of all such evidences from their creation  but that the necessary elements for validating them would be made available. Nevertheless,  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  29  recording all data issued and received by the QTSP, regardless of the type of QTS provided, is  recommended and may be proven to be useful to achieve the objectives of Article 24.2(h).  As an example, for QTSP issuing qualified certificate, [EN 319 411-1] (OVR-6.4.6-01) requires  the QTSP to record and keep available certain records (such as logs of event related to  certificates and relevant documentation) for a period of at least 7 years after any certificate  based on these records ceases to be valid (i.e. from when it expires or is revoked). Regarding  the period of retention, it is worth noting that “an appropriate period of time” may not necessarily  translate into 7 years. Application domains or sectoral regulations may require the period to be  considered as being much longer than that, and it is recommended in the present document to  consider this evaluation as part of the compliance management.  The termination plan, further detailed in the next section on Article 24.2(i), needs to include  procedures and means allowing the (Q)TSP to meet Article 24.2(h) of the eIDAS Regulation. In  particular, the termination plan should cover, at least, expected and unexpected cessation of  activities, the cessation of one, more or all the QTS from a QTSP, the potential take-over of  ceased activities by a third party or as a last resort by the SB, and the assurance of the  preservation and availability of the information referred to in Article 24.2.(h).  Additionally, it is recommended that the QTSP includes in its communication to subscribers (e.g.  as part of the termination notification and as part of the CP/CPS, terms and conditions)  information on the period of time during which the QTSP will ensure Article 24.2(h) referred data  are recorded and kept available and of the importance of the use by concerned parties of  appropriate procedures and technologies capable of extending such a period when applicable,  with regards to the data/records they are concerned with.  Types of records applicable to Article 24.2(h) are mostly dependent on the type of service(s)  provided by the QTSP.

As stated in Recital (41), Article  17(4) and Article 24.2(i), this document shall be verified by the SB because of its particular  importance regarding the sustainability and durability of qualified trust services and to boost  users’ confidence in the continuity of qualified trust services, such as in exceptional/unfortunate  cases of QTSP unscheduled termination (e.g. bankruptcy).  The termination plan should contain at least information on affected entities, reliable party  (parties) to which TSP obligations will be transferred, as well as a detailed procedure of  notification and transfer including a timing aspect with all affected parties taken into  consideration. Such document should be maintained as part of TSP documentation  management and change management processes, to keep it up to date.  TSP termination and termination plan are covered in clause 7.12 of [EN 319 401], where some  requirements or guidance may be found regarding the termination process. Clause 7.12 does  not however cover the actual content of the termination plan.  Depending on the type of service, the corresponding QTS-specific ETSI standards refine and  extend these requirements and recommendations. Where applicable, a reference to these  additional requirements and recommendations may be found in the table below:  Type of QTS Standard Reference  QTSP issuing qualified certificates [EN 319 411-1] Clause 6.4.9  QTSP providing qualified validation service for  QESig/QESeal  - -  QTSP providing qualified preservation service for  QESig/QESeal  [TS 119 511] Clause 7.12  QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps [EN 319 421] Clause 7.14  QTSP providing qualified electronic registered  delivery services  [EN 319 521] Clause 7.12  The [ENISA Guidelines on Termination of Qualified Trust Services] provides further guidance on  the termination obligations and activities, the exploration of a set of possible termination  scenarios, and a proposed structure of termination plan.

REQUIREMENTS FOR  PROVISION OF SPECIFIC QTS  This section details recommendations based on standards for QTSPs providing specific types of  QTS, to be used in addition to the above common recommendations, for the purpose of being  compliant with the requirements that are relevant for the provision of this specific QTS.  3.1 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP ISSUING QUALIFIED CERTIFICATES  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3 three types of certificates and three corresponding  types of qualified certificates:   Article 3(14): Certificate for electronic signature: an electronic attestation which links  electronic signature validation data to a natural person and confirms at least the name  or the pseudonym of that person;   Article 3(15): Qualified certificate for electronic signature: a certificate for electronic  signatures, that is issued by a qualified trust service provider and meets the  requirements laid down in Annex I;   Article 3(29): Certificate for electronic seal: an electronic attestation that links  electronic seal validation data to a legal person and confirms the name of that person;   Article 3(30): Qualified certificate for electronic seal: a certificate for an electronic seal,  that is issued by a qualified trust service provider and meets the requirements laid  down in Annex III;   Article 3(38): Certificate for website authentication: an attestation that makes it  possible to authenticate a website and links the website to the natural or legal person  to whom the certificate is issued;   Article 3(39): Qualified certificate for website authentication: a certificate for website  authentication, which is issued by a qualified trust service provider and meets the  requirements laid down in Annex IV.  Qualified certificates for electronic signatures / for electronic seals / for website authentication  may only be provided by a QTSP that has been granted to provide the related qualified trust  service(s).  In addition to common requirements for all QTPs, this chapter addresses specific requirements  in relation to the provision of these qualified trust services. These requirements of eIDAS cover  both the operations of issuance of such qualified certificates as a trust service, and the content  of the qualified certificate itself. Articles defining these requirements are illustrated in the  following figure.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  33  Figure 8: Requirements for QTSP issuing qualified certificates for eSig / eSeal / WSA  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Yes Annex A of [EN 319 411-2]  Conformity assessment checklist Yes Annex B of [EN 319 411-2]  3.1.1 Preliminary recommendations  3.1.1.1 ETSI qualified certificates policies  This section refers to [EN 319 411-2]. Requirements defined in this standard are dependent on  the type of qualified certificate provided by the QTSP. In particular, based on the certificate  policies defined in [EN 319 411-1] (i.e. NCP, NCP+, and EVCP), the standard defines five  eIDAS qualified certificate policies:  1. QCP-n: policy for qualified certificates issued to natural persons offering the level of  quality defined in eIDAS for qualified certificates (so to be used for certificates for  electronic signatures);  2. QCP-l: policy for qualified certificates issued to legal persons offering the level of  quality defined in eIDAS for qualified certificates (so to be used for certificates for  electronic seals);  3. QCP-n-qscd: policy including QCP-n requirements and requiring the use of a QSCD;  4. QCP-l-qscd: policy including QCP-l requirements and requiring the use of a QSCD;  5. QCP-w: policy for qualified website certificates offering the level of quality defined in  eIDAS used in support of website authentication.  3.1.1.2 Qualified certificates for PSD2  Regarding the specific case of qualified certificates for PSD2 (Directive (EU) 2015/2366), and in  addition to the applicable requirements below, requirements on the certificate profile and on the  TSP policies are listed in [ETSI TS 119 495].  3.1.1.3 Qualified certificates relying on a QSCD  Information on the eIDAS QSCD can be found at the end of Section 2.7.5, related to Article  24.2(e) on trustworthy systems and products.  It is important to note that the QTSP issuing qualified certificates with the private key located on  a QSCD shall monitor the QSCD certification status until the end of the validity period of the  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  34  certificate (and shall take appropriate measures in case of modification of this status), as stated  in SDP-6.5.1-07 of [EN 319 411-2]. Following Article 30 (on the certification of QSCD) and  Article 31 (on the publication of list of certified QSCD), it is recommended that the QTSP  monitors this QSCD certification status in the list of those certified QSCDs (and SSCDs)  published by the EC19. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this list is not constitutive; A device  may be a QSCD but not appear on the EC list. In practice, there may also be a delay between  the certification/determination of a device as a QSCD and its inclusion in the EC list.  In the particular case of a remote QSCD, “monitoring the QSCD certification status” should be  understood in the broad sense of whether the remote QSCD can still “be considered as a  QSCD”. Indeed, this status may be lost for different reasons:   As for a local QSCD, because the remote QSCD lost20 its certification (and is removed  from the published list); or   because the QTSP managing this remote QSCD on behalf of the signatory/creator of  seal has lost its qualified status because its “last” QTS lost its qualified status21.  3.1.1.4 Recognition of qualified certificates for website authentication as Extended  Validation certificates by browsers  Inclusion in the CA root stores of the main browsers (but also software vendors such as Adobe  or Oracle) may be seen as an interesting feature. As presented in the introduction, the  CA/Browser Forum has adopted guidelines and requirements as a common basis for CAs for  their eligibility in the CA root store programs.  The standards that are published by ETSI are developed by experts from different industries  and requirements from the CA/B Forum are included in the latest standards (e.g. [EN 319 411-  1]).  Audit for compliance against these ETSI standards (by a CAB qualified for audits against ETSI  EN 319 411 standards series) is recognized by browsers for inclusion in the root stores.  Alternatively, demonstration of compliance via the WebTrust Program for CAs is another  recognized path.  It is worth noting that for both alternatives, the latest CA/Browser Forum guidelines and  requirements (which might differ from the standards above due to separate document lifecycles)  still typically apply together with specific requirements for each root store program22, and the CA  (here the QTSP issuing QWACs) must still apply separately for the inclusion in each root store  program it is interested in.  As the present document focuses on QTSPs under eIDAS, further details underlying the  recognition of QWACs as EVs are beyond its scope. More information on the topic may be  found in:   [ENISA Towards global acceptance of eIDAS audits], in particular regarding the  relation between CA/B Forum guidelines, ETSI standards and WebTrust audit scheme.   The ETSI report [TR 103 684], in particular regarding legal context, supervision and  auditing, best practices, and trust representation of the WebTrust model.   [ENISA Conformity assessment of qualified trust service providers] regarding  multipurpose audits.  19 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  20 For instance, some QSCD certifications have an expiry date. But identified security vulnerabilities might also impact a  certification status.  21 A QTSP is qualified because it has at least one QTS.  22 See for instance https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  35  3.1.2 Article 24.1 (Identity verification)  Article 24.1 states that:  When issuing a qualified certificate for a trust service, a qualified trust service provider  shall verify, by appropriate means and in accordance with national law, the identity and, if  applicable, any specific attributes of the natural or legal person to whom the qualified  certificate is issued.  The information referred to in the first subparagraph shall be verified by the qualified trust  service provider either directly or by relying on a third party in accordance with national  law:  a) by the physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized representative of  the legal person; or  b) remotely, using electronic identification means, for which prior to the issuance of the  qualified certificate, a physical presence of the natural person or of an authorized  representative of the legal person was ensured and which meets the requirements  set out in Article 8 with regard to the assurance levels ‘substantial’ or ‘high’; or  c) by means of a certificate of a qualified electronic signature or of a qualified electronic  seal issued in compliance with point (a) or (b); or  d) by using other identification methods recognized at national level which provide  equivalent assurance in terms of reliability to physical presence. The equivalent  assurance shall be confirmed by a conformity assessment body  It must be stressed that this process is an essential part of the registration procedure for issuing  a qualified certificate, as this initial identity validation will determine the binding between the  (physical or legal) person and all subsequent signatures or seals supported by this certificate.  In addition, as stated in the eIDAS article, identity verification must be carried out in accordance  with the national law of the Member State in which the QTSP is established.  The process of identity verification has two key elements:   How the verification is actually performed;   If not performed with physical presence of the person, how the equivalence to this  physical presence can be ensured.  Generally, identity verification means collecting identity data and related evidence or attestation  from an appropriate and authorised source, checking its validity and authenticity, and binding  this data to the applicant. The most common way is to use a nationally recognized identity  document. Other means are for instance national registry information, bank or utility account  information, credit bureau information, or breeder documents (unless local legislation states  otherwise).  Guidelines on how to perform this identity verification may be found in clauses 6.2.2 and 6.2.3  of [EN 319 411-1] and clauses 6.2.2 of [EN 319 411-2]. However23, the requirements might be  seen as rather generic (no requirement on the verification procedure, definition of what “physical  presence” may mean or its equivalence in the light of new practices such as video onboarding),  considering the cruciality of this preliminary step.  23 The identity verification process in the certificate issuance process has a lot in common with identity proofing process  during (notified) issuance of electronic identification means. Therefore, another source of good practices (whenever  applicable) is the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 for the high and substantial assurance levels of  electronic identification means.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  36  As a result, a Specialist Task Force, STF 58824, has been setup at ETSI ESI. The scope of the  STF is “to produce specification on identity proofing for trust services as defined by eIDAS,  particularly for issuers of qualified and non-qualified certificates supporting electronic  signatures, electronic seals or website certificates. It needs to be aligned with, and to further  support the ETSI EN 319 411 parts 1 and 2 providing policy requirements for Trust Service  Providers (TSP) issuing such certificates”.  The expected results of STF 588 are twofold:   A survey of technologies and regulatory requirements for identity proofing for trust  service subjects: ETSI TR 119 460 “Electronic Signature and Infrastructures (ESI);  Survey of technologies and regulatory requirements for identity proofing for trust  service subjects” expected to be published in December 2020;   Requirements for identity proofing: ETSI TS 119 461 “Electronic Signatures and  Infrastructures (ESI); Policy and security requirements for trust service components  providing identity proofing of trust service subjects” expected to be published end of  July 2021.  NOTE: ETSI standards distinguish two types of identity verification:   Initial identity validation (clause 6.2.2 of [EN 319 411-1] and [EN 319 411-2]), where  the issuance of a certificate is meant for a person not registered by the QTSP;   Re-keying process (clause 6.2.3 of [EN 319 411-1]), which means the process of  issuance of a new certificate for the person who has already been registered by the  QTSP and possess a qualified certificate from this QTSP.  In case of a re-key request, the identity verification procedure can be simplified, where  existing evidence can be re-used to validate the identity, provided the evidence  remains valid given the time elapsed and it is allowed by the national legislation. In any  case, such a procedure must meet all the requirements of initial identity validation.  3.1.3 Article 24.2(k) (Certificate database)  Article 24.2(k) states that [a QTSP providing QTSs shall:]  in case of qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates, establish and  keep updated a certificate database.  The QTSP shall maintain a certificate database. This database should be protected to ensure  availability and integrity and should be maintained on an operational basis.  To be compliant with this article, it is recommended to follow clause 6.1 of [EN 319 411-1].  24 https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STF-HomePages/STF588  https://portal.etsi.org/STF/STFs/STF-HomePages/STF588  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  37  3.1.4 Articles 24.3 and 24.4 (Certificate revocation)  Article 24.3 states that:  If a qualified trust service provider issuing qualified certificates decides to revoke a  certificate, it shall register such revocation in its certificate database and publish the  revocation status of the certificate in a timely manner, and in any event within 24  hours after the receipt of the request. The revocation shall become effective  immediately upon its publication.  Article 24.4 states that:  With regard to paragraph 3, qualified trust service providers issuing qualified  certificates shall provide to any relying party information on the validity or revocation  status of qualified certificates issued by them. This information shall be made  available at least on a per certificate basis at any time and beyond the validity period  of the certificate in an automated manner that is reliable, free of charge and efficient.  These articles are related to operating and maintaining a certificate database and in particular to  revocation management and revocation status services described (in particular) in:   Clause 6.2.4 of [EN 319 411-1];   Clause 6.3.9 of [EN 319 411-1];   Clauses 6.3.10 of [EN 319 411-1] and [EN 319 411-2].  Generally, validity / revocation status information should be available 24 hours per day, 7 days  per week. In case of failure, TSP should endeavour to ensure that this information service is not  unavailable for longer than a maximum period of time as denoted in the Certification Practice  Statement. As this availability is crucial, the QTSP should identify assets, vulnerabilities, and  countermeasures to minimalize risk of loss of availability. Following Article 19, it is  recommended to include these aspects in the global risk management process.  Two methods of providing validity and revocation status are the most popular: through a  Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Clause 6.3.10 of  [EN 319 411-1] provides further guidance on the selection of the method(s).  In case both methods are supported by a TSP, the information provided by all services shall, as  required by eIDAS, be consistent over time. Different delays in updating the status information  for all these methods should be taken into account.  For more information about availability of service assurance, one can refer to [ISO/IEC 20000-1]  clause 6.  3.1.5 Articles 28.1-3, 38.1-3, and 45 (Content of certificates)  Article 28.1 to 28.3 states that:  1. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall meet the requirements laid down  in Annex I.  2. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures shall not be subject to any mandatory  requirement exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex I.  3. Qualified certificates for electronic signatures may include non-mandatory additional  specific attributes. Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition  of qualified electronic signatures.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  38  Article 38.1 to 38.3 states that:  1. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall meet the requirements laid down in  Annex III.  2. Qualified certificates for electronic seals shall not be subject to any mandatory  requirements exceeding the requirements laid down in Annex III.  3. Qualified certificates for electronic seals may include non-mandatory additional  specific attributes. Those attributes shall not affect the interoperability and recognition  of qualified electronic seals.  Article 45.1 states that:  1. Qualified certificates for website authentication shall meet the requirements laid down  in Annex IV.  These requirements address the content of the certificates. Annex I, III, and IV of the eIDAS  Regulation contain detailed requirements for certificate content. A QTSP issuing qualified  certificates should prepare a certificate profile for this purpose. The Regulation mandates only  information listed in Annex I, III, and IV to be present, but other information can be added by a  QTSP.  Regarding the profile of certificates, it is recommended to follow:   [EN 319 411-1] clause 6.6.1;   [EN 319 411-2] clause 6.6.1;  NOTE: While following [EN 319 411-1] or [EN 319 411-2] it is a non-mandatory  recommendation to be compliant with the eIDAS requirements, claiming for a TSP to  be compliant with [EN 319 411-1] or [EN 319 411-2] requires compliance to (where  applicable) [EN 319 412-2], [EN 319 412-3], [EN 319 412-4] and [EN 319 412-5], as  stated in clause 6.6.1 of [EN 319 411-1] and clause 6.6.1 of [EN 319 411-2].   [EN 319 412-1], providing an overview and common data structures on certificate  profiles;   [EN 319 412-2], providing certificate profile for certificates issued to natural persons  (so to be used for certificates for electronic signatures);   [EN 319 412-3], providing certificate profile for certificates issued to legal persons (so  to be used for certificates for electronic seals);   [EN 319 412-4], providing certificate profile for web site certificates (so to be used for  certificates for website authentication);   [EN 319 412-5], standardizing indications related to qualified certificates per se.  NOTE: In Annex I a), III a) and IV a), eIDAS doesn’t mandate the use the ETSI “id-etsi-  qcs-QcCompliance (id-etsi-qcs 1)” statement, further specified by the “id-etsi-qcs-  QcType (id-etsi-qcs 6)” defined in [EN 319 412-5] as “indication at least in a form  suitable for automated processing” that the certificate has been issued as a qualified  certificate and for which type. Still, the use of these standardised statements are highly  recommended as the specifications of the EU MS trusted lists defined in CID (EU)  2015/1505 are using these statements as the “benchmark statements” for the machine  processable indication referred above. The same applies for the ETSI “id-etsi-qcs-  QcSSCD (id-etsi-qcs 4)” as “indication at least in a form suitable for automated  processing” that the corresponding private key is located in an EU QSCD.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  39  All the certificate profiles specified in the ETSI EN 319 412 series are based upon  [Recommendation ITU-T X.509] and [RFC 5280]. It is important to note that point (b) of Annexes  I, III, and IV of the eIDAS Regulation requires that qualified certificates shall include:  a set of data unambiguously representing the qualified trust service provider issuing  the qualified certificates including at least the Member State in which that provider is  established and:  - for a legal person: the name and, where applicable, registration number as  stated in the official records;  - for a natural person: the person’s name.  The best practice to implement this requirement is by using the organizationName attribute  (“O=” attribute) of the Issuer field of the qualified certificate. As per [RFC 5280] specifications,  the “O=” attribute of the Issuer field of the qualified certificate shall be identical to the Subject  field of the issuing CA certificate. In accordance with point (b) of the Annexes, this “O=” attribute  must be identical – preferably case sensitively – to the name of the QTSP as stated in the  official records and hence the name (or trade name if applicable) present in the trusted list25.  Additionally, where applicable, the qualified certificate should also contain in the  organizationIdentifier attribute the registration number as stated in the official records. Further  guidance on the latter may be found in [EN 319 412-1].  Implementing additional attributes should be developed according to the same rules. During  development of additional fields in certificate structure, the TSP may use the [EN 319 412-1]  standard. As stated in the eIDAS article, introduction of additional (non-mandatory) attributes  should not affect mandatory interoperability. Examples of additional (non-mandatory) attributes  are: Organizational Unit, State or Province Name, Locality, Title.  The QTSP should also keep the certificate profile adequate to applicable regulations.  3.1.6 Articles 28.4 and 38.4 (Certificate revocation)  These articles only apply to certificates for electronic signatures and certificates for electronic  seals, excluding certificates for website authentication.  Article 28.4 (the same applies to Article 38.4 where ‘signature’ is replaced by ‘seal’) states  that:  If a qualified certificate for electronic signatures has been revoked after initial  activation, it shall lose its validity from the moment of its revocation, and its status  shall not in any circumstances be reverted.  This article concerns qualified certificates for electronic signatures/seals that have been revoked  after initial activation. It is therefore allowed and is a good/acceptable practice to create  qualified certificate in a “on hold” status before its initial activation (e.g. once QTSP is convinced  that it has been issued to the right person). At initial activation, this “on hold” status is reverted  but after this, a potential revocation shall never be reverted, as required by Article 28.4.  TSP should conduct risk analysis to recognize all potential activities which can lead to  reinstating a revoked certificate, for example restoring from backup. After the identification of  potential threats appropriate countermeasures should be taken. A suggested solution is to  25 The issuing CA certificate is usually provided by the TSP to the Trusted List Scheme Operator to be listed in the trusted  list as the Service Digital Identity (SDI), defined in clause 5.5.3 of ETSI TS 119 612 v2.1.1, made mandatory by [CID  2015/1505] on technical specifications and formats relating to trusted lists.  Clause 5.5.3 defines specific requirements on the “O=” attribute of the SDI. Non-compliance with this clause can reflect a  potential non-compliance with [CID 2015/1505] and therefore eIDAS Regulation.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  40  choose an appropriate technology which prevents reinstating revoked certificates, or to enable  the replay (e.g. based on logs) of all applicable revocations since the last backup.  Before a TSP issues a certificate, some obligations should be accepted by the subject and/or  subscriber. One of them is not to create any electronic signature with the private key if the  certificate has been revoked (cf. [EN 319 411-1] OVR-6.3.5-01 j)).  As required by REV-6.3.9-01 of [EN 319 411-1], the TSP shall revoke certificates in a timely  manner based on authorized and validated certificate revocation requests mentioned in clause  6.2.4 of [EN 319 411-1] and [EN 319 411-2].  Recommendations to achieve compliance with these articles are proposed in REV-6.3.9-04 of  [EN 319 411-1]26.  3.1.7 Articles 28.5 and 38.5 (Temporary suspension of certificates)  These articles only apply to certificates for electronic signatures and certificates for electronic  seals, excluding certificates for website authentication27.  Article 28.5 (the same applies to Article 38.5 where ‘signature’ is replaced by ‘seal’) states  that:  Subject to the following conditions, Member States may lay down national rules on  temporary suspension of a qualified certificate for electronic signature:  a) if a qualified certificate for electronic signature has been temporarily suspended  that certificate shall lose its validity for the period of suspension;  b) the period of suspension shall be clearly indicated in the certificate database and  the suspension status shall be visible, during the period of suspension, from the  service providing information on the status of the certificate.  Certificate suspension is subject to national regulation, and so may vary between Member  States28. The TSP should perform a compliance management process to ensure compliance to  local regulation of the Member state in which it is established.  If suspension is allowed in a Member State, it is recommended to follow the provisions of:   [EN 319 411-1] clauses 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10;   [EN 319 411-2] clauses 6.2.4, 6.3.9 and 6.3.10.  In case of discrepancies between the standards and national law, national law prevails.  26 It should be noted that, while these eIDAS articles exclude certificates for website authentication, the corresponding  clauses of [EN 319 411-1] apply to them as well. As such, these may be seen as recommendations for certificates for  website authentication.  27 Similarly to the previous section, while the eIDAS articles exclude certificates for website authentication, the  corresponding clauses of [EN 319 411-1] apply to them as well. As such, these may be seen as recommendations for  certificates for website authentication.  28 For instance, suspension of qualified certificate for electronic signatures, electronic seals and website authentication is  forbidden in France, as stated in Section II.3.4. of https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/eidas_delivrance-certificats- qualifies_v1.1_anssi.pdf (in French), but allowed in Luxembourg.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/eidas_delivrance-certificats-qualifies_v1.1_anssi.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/06/eidas_delivrance-certificats-qualifies_v1.1_anssi.pdf  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  41  3.2 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING QUALIFIED VALIDATION  SERVICES FOR QESIG/QESEAL  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(41) a validation as the process of verifying and  confirming that an electronic signature or a seal is valid. Validation of the signature of an  electronic transaction is an essential process for allowing any relying party to trust the  corresponding signed data and/or document.  In a nutshell (detailed validation process is further covered below), for a qualified electronic  signature, the validation service consists in verifying that it meets the requirements set out in  Article 26 (requirements on advanced electronic signatures), it is created by a QSigCD 29, and it  is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. For a qualified electronic seal, the  validation service consists in verifying that it meets the requirements set out in Article 36  (requirements on advanced electronic seals), is created by a QSealCD, and it is based on a  qualified certificate for electronic seal.  A QTSP may be granted a qualified status to provide both of these services, or only one of them.  Requirements on the validation of qualified electronic signatures are specified in Article 32 and  33 of eIDAS. Regarding the validation of qualified electronic seals, Article 40 of eIDAS states that  these articles \"shall apply mutatis mutandis to the validation […] of qualified electronic seals\".  In particular, the qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures and seals is  specified by:   Article 33 (resp. Article 40) for the requirements on qualified validation services of  qualified electronic signatures/seals; which includes by reference;   Article 32 (resp. Article 40) for the requirements on the validation of qualified electronic  signatures/seals.  Figure 9: Requirements for QTSP providing qualified validation services for QESig / QESeal  The table below indicates whether a mapping with the eIDAS Regulation and whether a  conformity assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI  standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Yes Annex B and C of [TS 119 441]  Conformity assessment checklist Yes Annex E of [TS 119 441]  29 QSCD stands for both QSigCD and QSealCD. In case of ambiguity or necessity, the explicit acronym QSigCD or  QSealCD is used.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  42  3.2.1 Article 32 (Validation of QESig/QESeal)  Article 32.1 states that:  The process for the validation of a qualified electronic signature shall confirm the validity  of a qualified electronic signature provided that:  a) the certificate that supports the signature was, at the time of signing, a qualified  certificate for electronic signature complying with Annex I;  b) the qualified certificate was issued by a qualified trust service provider and was  valid at the time of signing;  c) the signature validation data corresponds to the data provided to the relying  party;  d) the unique set of data representing the signatory in the certificate is correctly  provided to the relying party;  e) the use of any pseudonym is clearly indicated to the relying party if a pseudonym  was used at the time of signing;  f) the electronic signature was created by a qualified electronic signature creation  device;  g) the integrity of the signed data has not been compromised;  h) the requirements provided for in Article 26 were met at the time of signing.  Article 32.2 states that:  The system used for validating the qualified electronic signature shall provide to the  relying party the correct result of the validation process and shall allow the relying  party to detect any security relevant issues.  NOTE: Use of pseudonym (see Article 32.1(e)) is not applicable to electronic seals.  Several ETSI standards currently exists regarding the validation process:   [TS 119 441] specifying policy requirements for TSP providing signature validation  services;   [TS 119 172-4] (currently in draft) on the signatures applicability rules (validation  policy) for European qualified electronic signatures/seals using trusted lists. This  standard Provides rules for the determination of the technical suitability of a digital  signature to be considered QES by making reference to:  o [EN 319 102-1] / [TS 119 102-1] specifying procedures for validation of digital  signatures. This standard is to be used to validate whether the provided digital  signature/seal is an advanced electronic signature/seal in the sense of eIDAS.  This document refers to [TS 119 312] for guidance regarding the  cryptographic algorithm’s validity, based on the agreed cryptographic  mechanisms from SOG-IS;  When validating a signature, the QTSP must take care of the potential  security related issues against either national rules or [TS 119 312].  o [TS 119 615] (currently in draft) on the procedures for using and interpreting  European Union Member States National Trusted Lists. This standard is to be  used to validate the qualified status of the electronic signature/seal.   These standards rely on the definition of an AdES (digital) signature as a digital  signature that is either a CAdES signature (as specified in [EN 319 122-1] or older), or  a PAdES signature (as specified is [EN 319 142-1] or older) or a XAdES signature (as  specified is [EN 319 132-1] or older)30;  30 At the time of writing, a new format, JAdES signature, is being specified under [TS 119 182-1].  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  43   These standards refer to [TS 119 101] defining policy and security requirements for  applications for signature creation and signature validation.  In addition to the above standards and ETSI Conformance Checkers, the European  Commission has made available different tools and documents that may be found helpful for  implementing signatures/seals validation:   DSS (Digital Signature Services)31: an open-source software library for digital signature  creation, validation, and augmentation, designed to help digital solutions achieve  compliance with the eIDAS Regulation, either by integrating it or cross-checking an  implementation against it;   DSS Demonstration WebApp32 : a demonstration of integration of the DSS library in a  web application;   “Introduction to the Qualified electronic signature (QES) validation algorithm33”: a  document describing the validation algorithm used by DSS library, aligned with the  above-listed standards;   Test cases for assessing an implementation of electronic signatures and seals  validation34: A web site hosting 100+ test cases35 that can be used by a TSP or by any  conformity assessment body or supervisory body to verify or demonstrate the  conformity a validation service.  3.2.2 Article 33 (Qualified validation service for QESig/QESeal)  Article 33.1 states that:  A qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be provided by a  qualified trust service provider who:  a) provides validation in compliance with Article 32(1); and  b) allows relying parties to receive the result of the validation process in an automated  manner, which is reliable, efficient and bears the advanced electronic signature or  advanced electronic seal of the provider of the qualified validation service.  Article 33 (resp. Article 40 for qualified electronic seals) defines requirements for QTSPs  providing qualified validation service for qualified electronic signatures. It shall:   be provided by a QTSP;   provide validation in compliance with Article 32 for which guidelines are provided  above;   provide the validation result in an automated manner that needs:  o to be reliable and efficient; and  o to bear the advanced electronic signature or advanced electronic seal of the  QTSP providing the qualified validation service.  Requirements on the validation result (or validation report) are provided in Annex B of [TS 119 441].  31 https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/DSS  32 Hosted by the European Commission and currently available via https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/DSS/webapp-demo/  33 Currently available via  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Qualified+electronic+signature+%28QES%29+validation+algorithm  34 Hosted by the European Commission and currently available via https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/esig-validation- tests/testcases  35 Algorithms in [TS 119 615] and [TS 119 172-4] have shown that there can be identified 100+ variations of cases based  on combinations of the certificate content, trusted list content, pre/post-eIDAS time of signing, etc.  https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/DSS https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/DSS/webapp-demo/ https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Qualified+electronic+signature+%28QES%29+validation+algorithm https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/esig-validation-tests/testcases https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/esig-validation-tests/testcases  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  44  Additionally, [TS 119 102-2] specifies a recommended general structure and XML format for  reporting the validation of digital signatures, in line with the requirements specified in [EN 319 102-  1] / [TS 119 102-1].  3.3 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING QUALIFIED  PRESERVATION SERVICE FOR QESIG/QESEAL  Preservation under eIDAS ensures the long-term preservation of the trustworthiness of  electronic signatures and seals, in order (cf. Recital (61) of eIDAS) “to ensure their legal validity  over extended periods of time and guarantee that they can be validated irrespective of future  technological changes”.  Requirements for qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures are laid down  in Article 34 of eIDAS Regulation, which defines the purpose of such preservation to be  “extending the trustworthiness of the qualified electronic signature beyond the technological  validity period”.  This type of service should not be confused with electronic archiving aimed at ensuring that a  document is stored (or converted from a paper-based original version) in order to guarantee its  integrity and benefit from legal features). Electronic archiving has not been identified as a trust  service under eIDAS (as detailed in the definition under Article 3(16), which is a closed list of  trust services). Consequently, the definition of requirements on electronic archiving remains the  competence of Member States. More information on the differences and relationships between  an archival service and a preservation service can be found in [TS 119 511], such as:   The preservation of an electronic signature could be achieved through PKI-based  signature augmentation, without storage by the TSP;   The preservation of an electronic signature could be achieved through electronic  archiving (i.e. with storage by the TSP) ensuring that the signature has not been  modified since its submission to the TSP.  Requirements for a qualified preservation service for qualified electronic seals are laid down in  Article 40 and states that Article 34 \"shall apply mutatis mutandis to the […] preservation of  qualified electronic seals\".  Figure 10: Requirements for QTSP providing qualified preservation service for QESig / QESeal  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Yes Annex B of [TS 119 511]  Conformity assessment checklist No N/A  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  45  3.3.1 Article 34 (Qualified preservation service for QESig/QESeal)  Article 34.1 states that:  A qualified preservation service for qualified electronic signatures may only be  provided by a qualified trust service provider that uses procedures and technologies  capable of extending the trustworthiness of the qualified electronic signature beyond  the technological validity period.  Standards that are proposed by ETSI to TSP providing preservation services are:   [TS 119 511] “Policy and security requirements for trust service providers providing  long-term preservation of digital signatures or general data using digital signature  techniques”;   [TS 119 512] “Protocols for trust service providers providing long-term data  preservation services”.  More specifically, in order to achieve compliance with Article 34 (resp. Article 40), [TS 119 511]  sets requirements on:   Cryptographic monitoring in clause 7.14. In particular, [TS 119 312] may be considered  when evaluating the cryptographic algorithm (NOTE: this standard may be superseded  by national recommendations);   Augmentation of preservation evidences in clause 7.15;   Preservation evidences in clause 9.2;   Preservation of digital signatures in clause 9.3;   Verification of the qualified status of the signature or the seal in OVR-A-02.  In line with Article 24.2(e) on trustworthy systems, in order to ensure secure communication  between the preservation client and the PSP (authentication of the client and confidentiality of  the data), [TS 119 511] refers to [TS 119 512] for the preservation protocol (clause 8.1).  3.4 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP ISSUING QUALIFIED ELECTRONIC TIME  STAMPS  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(33) an electronic time stamp as data in electronic  form which binds other data in electronic form to a particular time establishing evidence that the  latter data existed at that time.  A qualified electronic time stamp is defined in Article 3(34) as an electronic time stamp which  meets the requirements laid down in Article 42. A qualified time stamp enjoys the legal  presumption of the accuracy of the date and time it indicates and of the integrity of stamped  data from the time of stamping (cf. Article 41(2)).  Figure 11: Requirements for QTSP issuing qualified electronic time stamps  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  46  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation Partial Annex E of [EN 319 421]  Conformity assessment checklist Yes Annex H of [EN 319 421]  3.4.1 Article 42 (Qualified electronic time stamp)  Article 42 states that:  A qualified electronic time stamp shall meet the following  requirements:  a) it binds the date and time to data in such a manner as to  reasonably preclude the possibility of the data being changed  undetectably;  b) it is based on an accurate time source linked to Coordinated  Universal Time; and  c) it is signed using an advanced electronic signature or sealed  with an advanced electronic seal of the qualified trust service  provider, or by some equivalent method.  Standards that are proposed by CEN and ETSI to TSP providing a time-stamping service are:   [EN 319 421] “Policy and Security Requirements for Trust Service Providers issuing  Electronic Time-Stamps” enforcing good security practices and correct time-  management of a timestamping authority;   [EN 319 422] “Time-stamping protocol and electronic time-stamp profiles” ensuring the  binding of the date and time to data in the produced timestamps;   [EN 419 231] “Protection profile for trustworthy systems supporting time stamping”.  More specifically, in order to aim for compliance with Article 42, [EN 319 421] specifies that:   Issued time stamps shall conform with the time stamp profile defined in [EN 319 422].  This intends to achieve compliance with the eIDAS definition of an electronic time stamp;   Time stamps shall be issued securely. This is covered by clause d) and e) of [EN 319  421] clause 7.7.1. This intends to achieve compliance with clause a) and c) of Article 42;   Time stamps shall include the correct time. This is covered by clause a), b), and c) of  [EN 319 421] clause 7.7.1 and clause 7.7.2. This intends to achieve compliance with  clause b) of Article 42.  Regarding the secure issuance of the time stamp, following [EN 319 421], it shall be signed  using a key generated exclusively for this purpose. To that end, this key is stored in a time  stamping unit (TSU) that is defined as a set of hardware and software which is managed as a  unit and has a single time stamp signing key active at a time. [EN 319 421] specifies specific  requirements for the generation, protection, rekeying, and expiration of this TSU’s signing key in  clause 7.6.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  47  In particular, the TSU shall be trustworthy and comply with Article 24.2(e). For that purpose,  CEN issued [EN 419 231] to provide a protection profile dedicated to trustworthy systems  supporting time stamping.  3.5 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING QUALIFIED ELECTRONIC  REGISTERED DELIVERY SERVICES  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(36) an electronic registered delivery service as a  service that makes it possible to transmit data between third parties by electronic means and  provides evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data, including proof of sending  and receiving the data, and that protects transmitted data against the risk of loss, theft, damage  or any unauthorised alterations.  In practice, the data referred to by that definition as being transmitted under such a service from  a sender to a receiver can be of any type, including electronic documents (initially created in  electronic form or dematerialised documents), structured or not. The transmission means can  be of any kind as well including but not limited to email. When the registered delivery service is  built on the formats, protocols and mechanisms used in ordinary e-mail messaging, the service  is called “registered electronic mail service” by the standard literature.  A qualified electronic registered delivery service (QERDS) is an electronic registered delivery  which meets the requirements laid down in Article 44 (cf. Article 3(37) of eIDAS). It should be  noted that a QERDS may directly transfer data from the sender to addressee or use (possibly a  network of) other QERDS services.  Figure 12: Requirements for QTSP providing qualified electronic registered delivery services  The table below indicates whether a mapping with eIDAS Regulation and whether a conformity  assessment checklist for this type of trust service are currently provided by ETSI standards:  Available Standard reference  Mapping with eIDAS Regulation No N/A  Conformity assessment checklist No N/A  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  48  3.5.1 Article 44 (Qualified electronic registered delivery service)  Article 44.1 states that:  Qualified electronic registered delivery services shall meet the following requirements:  a) they are provided by one or more qualified trust service provider(s);  b) they ensure with a high level of confidence the identification of the sender;  c) they ensure the identification of the addressee before the delivery of the data;  d) the sending and receiving of data is secured by an advanced electronic  signature or an advanced electronic seal of a qualified trust service provider in  such a manner as to preclude the possibility of the data being changed  undetectably;  e) any change of the data needed for the purpose of sending or receiving the data  is clearly indicated to the sender and addressee of the data;  f) the date and time of sending, receiving and any change of data are indicated by  a qualified electronic time stamp.  In the event of the data being transferred between two or more qualified trust service  providers, the requirements in points (a) to (f) shall apply to all the qualified trust service  providers.  Regarding clause (a), the boundaries of qualified electronic registered delivery service are  established by a network of qualified trust service providers. QTSP should manage these  relationships and make sure that the entire “qualified electronic delivery network” it uses is  based on the services from qualified trust service providers, present in an eIDAS trusted list for  providing such kind of service.  Then, standards that are proposed by ETSI to TSP providing electronic registered delivery  services are:   [EN 319 521] “Policy and security requirements for Electronic Registered Delivery  Service Providers”;   [EN 319 522] multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Electronic  Registered Delivery Services;   [TS 119 524] multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance  and Interoperability of Electronic Registered Delivery Services;   [EN 319 531] “Policy and security requirements for Registered Electronic Mail Service  Providers”;   [EN 319 532] multi-part deliverable providing technical specifications for Registered  Electronic Mail Services;   [TS 119 534] multi-part deliverable providing requirements for Testing Conformance  and Interoperability of Registered Electronic Mail Services.  In particular, [EN 319 531] mostly rely on [EN 319 521] which defines specific provisions for  qualified electronic registered delivery services regarding the following aspects:   User content integrity and confidentiality in clauses 5.1;   User identification and authentication in clause 5.2;   Time reference in clause 5.3;   Events and evidence in clause 5.4.  3.6 REQUIREMENTS FOR QTSP PROVIDING REMOTE QSCD SERVICES  The eIDAS Regulation defines in Article 3(12) a qualified electronic signature as an advanced  electronic signature that is created by a qualified electronic signature creation device  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  49  [(QSCD36)], and which is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. The same  definition applies mutatis mutandis to a qualified electronic seal.  The Regulation also states through Recital(51) that it should be possible for the signatory (resp.  creator of the seal) to entrust QSCDs to the care of a third party, provided that appropriate  mechanisms and procedures are implemented to ensure that the signatory (resp. creator of the  seal) has sole control (resp. control) over the use of his electronic signature/seal creation data,  and the qualified electronic signature/seal requirements are met by the use of the device.  It is worth mentioning that a standard designed for signature and aiming thus to ascertain the  sole control, might be too severe for seal. To this regard, [TR 419 210] can be used to assess  what can or cannot be done when aiming to achieve a certain context of creation of the seal  (local versus remote (applicable to TSP), shared authentication, shared key, etc.) while  complying to these norms.  As stated in eIDAS Recital (52), in order to ensure that such electronic signatures[/seals]  receive the same legal recognition as electronic signature[/seals] created in an entirely user-  managed environment, remote electronic signature service providers should apply specific  management and administrative security procedures and use trustworthy systems and products.  For that purpose, remote QSCDs may only be provided by QTSPs.  It should also be noted that the management of a remote QSCD as a service is not a qualified  trust service per se but, as it shall be provided by a QTSP, this section proposes guidelines for  the provision of such a service (on top of the ones provided in Section 2) pursuant to the  objective of the present document to provide recommendations for QTSPs.  Following the definition of a QSCD, such a device shall meet the requirements laid down in  Annex II. Hence, its conformity to those requirements shall be certified according to Articles  30(1) and (3) for QSigCD or 39(2) for QSealCD.  Figure 13: Requirements for QTSP providing remote QSCD services  36 QSCD stands for both QSigCD and QSealCD. In case of ambiguity or necessity, the explicit acronym QSigCD or  QSealCD is used.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  50  3.6.1 Annex II and Articles 30 and 39 (Requirements and certification)  Pursuant to Annex II, the standard that is proposed by ETSI to QTSP providing service  components operating a remote QSCD is [TS 119 431-1] “Policy and security requirements for  trust service providers; Part 1: TSP service components operating a remote QSCD / SCDev”,  and in particular the EU SSASC37 policy (EUSCP) defined in this standard.  Pursuant to Article 30(3) and 39(2), the standards for the security assessment of information  technology products that apply to the certification of qualified electronic signature creation  devices or qualified electronic seal creation devices are laid down in [CID 2016/650].  However, at the time of drafting the [CID 2016/650], there were no available standards yet for  signing devices operated by a trust service provider generating or managing signature creation  data on behalf of the user to support the creation of qualified electronic signature / seals, and  the security assessment of products were performed via “alternative processes” as defined  under Article 30(3)b and as notified to the European Commission.  Since then, standards have been published by CEN to address the security assessment of such  signing devices38, namely:   [EN 419 241-2] “Trustworthy Systems Supporting Server Signing - Part 2: Protection  profile for QSCD for Server Signing”, which refers to [EN 419 241-1]39 “Trustworthy  Systems Supporting Server Signing - Part 1: General System Security Requirements”;  and   [EN 419 221-5] “Protection Profiles for TSP Cryptographic Modules - Part 5 –  Cryptographic Module for Trust Services”.  ENISA produced the report [Assessment of standards related to eIDAS] providing a description,  analysis, and assessment of the eligibility of the above-mentioned standards as being suitable  references in an amended version of [CID 2016/650]40 and concluded the importance that, on  top of those standards:   The TSP managing the Trustworthy Systems Supporting Server Signing follows [TS  119 431-1] (or equivalent);   The CA issuing the certificates follows [EN 319 411-1] (or equivalent);   For qualified devices management and qualified certificates issuance, the verification  that such requirements are followed, falls under supervision by the competent  supervisory bodies.  NOTE: It is worth noting the interrelation between the two. If the QTSP managing the  remote QSCD loses its qualified status because its “last” QTS loses its qualified status,  the remote QSCD may no longer be considered as a QSCD, although the device may  be listed in the European Commission’s Compilation of Member States notification on  SSCDs and QSCDs41 (the listing of such certified devices clearly states that a  condition for the listed device to be considered as QSCD is to be operated by a  QTSP). This has a direct impact on the QTSP issuing the qualified certificates for  which the private keys reside on this remote QSCD. The QSCD “status” of these  37 SSASCD stands for Server Signing Application Service Component.  38 The availability of new standards does not mean that Article 30.3(b) cannot be called anymore; this article still foresees  alternatives in the absence of referred standards to in point (a) of Article 30 or when a security evaluation process referred  to in point (a) is ongoing.  39 It is worth noting that [EN 419 241-1] specifies two assurance levels regarding the sole control on the key by the  signatory.  40 At the time of writing, the update of [CID 2016/650] is under discussion between the European Commission and the  Member States. No planning is publicly available.  41 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/compilation-member-states-notification-sscds-and-qscds  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR QTSPS BASED ON STANDARDS  March 2021  51  qualified certificates may not be considered as correct anymore, and signatures  created with these private keys may no longer be considered as qualified.  The [Assessment of standards related to eIDAS] report is suggested for additional guidelines  relating to the standards listed in the present section. The report also provides, in Section 4.6  and reproduced here below, a figure illustrating how the elements of Annex II that apply in the  case where a QTSP manages the QSCDs are covered by existing standards:  Figure 14: Elements of eIDAS Annex II and applicability of the standards  Of particular interest are [CEN 419 221-5] and [ETSI TS 119 431-1] which further provide a  mapping between specific clauses and respectively Annex II requirements for the former,  elements of the eIDAS Recitals and Annex II requirements for the latter.

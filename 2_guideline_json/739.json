Australian governments,  business and individuals are increasingly embracing  the opportunities the internet offers.  Harnessing these opportunities also creates risks.  The threat from malicious cyber activity against  Australian interests is increasing in frequency, scale,  sophistication and severity.  Cyber threats are often multi-dimensional and  borderless in nature, and require an equally flexible  response from those affected.  Managing cyber risks is a shared responsibility.  Australian governments, business and individuals have  a mutual responsibility to safeguard their use of the  internet and digital systems.  Effective cyber security cannot be achieved in isolation.  Partnerships between Australian governments,  business and the community are key to advancing and  protecting Australia’s interests online.  Introduction  The aim of the Cyber Incident Management  Arrangements (CIMA) for Australian governments is to  reduce the scope, impact and severity of national cyber  incidents on all Australians.  The CIMA provides Australian governments with  guidance on how they will collaborate in response  to, and reduce the harm associated with, national  cyber incidents.  Scope  The CIMA outlines the inter-jurisdictional coordination  arrangements, roles and responsibilities, and principles  for Australian governments’ cooperation in response to  national cyber incidents.  The CIMA is not an operational incident management  protocol. The detailed operational plans that underpin  the CIMA will be jointly developed and maintained by  Australian governments.  Cyber Incident  Management  Arrangements  for Australian   Governments  The CIMA supports, but does not replace, existing  cyber incident management arrangements within each  jurisdiction. Australian governments will continue to  maintain their respective cyber incident management  arrangements and will apply the CIMA to support  national collaboration and coordination efforts.  The arrangements acknowledge that Australian  business and community organisations may have  existing cyber incident management arrangements,  including arrangements for public communications  and engagement. The CIMA may inform these existing  arrangements by providing advice on anticipated  Australian governments’ response activities.  Relationship with crisis  management arrangements  The CIMA is subordinate to, and does not change,  existing national crisis management arrangements.  If a national cyber incident reaches a crisis level,  the CIMA will support jurisdictions’ respective crisis  management arrangements, for example the  Australian Government Crisis Management Framework  (AGCMF).  Key Terms  and Concepts  Cyber incident  A cyber incident is a single or series of unwanted or  unexpected event(s) that impact the confidentiality,  integrity or availability of a network or system or the  information that it stores, processes or communicates.  National cyber incident  A national cyber incident is a cyber incident that:  • significantly impacts, or has the potential  to significantly impact, multiple Australian  jurisdictions, and/or  • requires a coordinated inter-jurisdictional  response.  The incident could affect multiple jurisdictions  simultaneously or could pose a threat to multiple  jurisdictions after initially affecting a single jurisdiction.  Examples of potential national cyber incidents include:  • an organisation with links across multiple  jurisdictions being compromised through  a cyber incident  • malicious cyber activity affecting critical national  infrastructure where the consequences have  the potential to cause sustained disruption of  essential services or threaten national security  • malicious cyber activity where the cause and  potential extent of its geographic impact is  uncertain, and  • a large-scale information system breach of  sensitive data affecting persons or organisations  in multiple jurisdictions.  A national cyber incident falls below the threshold  required to activate national crisis arrangements,  such as the Commonwealth’s AGCMF. However,  a national cyber incident may escalate to a crisis  cyber.gov.au  |  2  in some circumstances – for example, if it results in  sustained disruption to essential services, severe  economic damage, a threat to national security or loss  of life.  The precise escalation point from a national cyber  incident to a crisis will be determined on a case-by-case  basis, in accordance with existing crisis management  arrangements.  Declaring a national cyber incident  The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) is the  Australian Government’s lead agency on national cyber  security operational matters.  All Australian governments, business and the  community are encouraged to report cyber incidents  to the ACSC.  The ACSC assess all reported cyber incidents against  an incident categorisation framework that considers  the scope, impact and severity of an incident and its  potential to harm Australia.  If a cyber incident significantly impacts, or has  the potential to significantly impact, multiple  Australian jurisdictions, and/or requires a coordinated  inter-jurisdictional response, the ACSC may declare  a national cyber incident in consultation with cyber  security leads from affected Australian governments.  State and territory government cyber security leads  may also request the ACSC declare a national cyber  incident.  The declaration of a national cyber incident will  activate the CIMA arrangements.  National  Coordination  Arrangements  Coordinating action during  a national cyber incident  Upon declaring a national cyber incident, the National  Cyber Security Committee (NCSC) will activate to  support national collaboration and coordination of  response efforts.  The NCSC is the peak cyber security coordination  body for Australian governments. The NCSC provides  strategic oversight and coordination of governments’  cyber security policies and operational capabilities  nationally.  The NCSC provides strategic coordination of  national response efforts, and its members (or their  representatives) are responsible for leading their  jurisdiction’s response to a national cyber incident.  The NCSC’s role in responding to a national cyber  incident includes:  • facilitating the exchange of threat intelligence  and solutions to enhance jurisdictions’ situational  awareness and response activities  • overseeing the development of nationally  consistent public information  • providing a forum for consultation that  informs members’ briefings to their respective  senior stakeholders (including Ministers), and  • facilitating, where practicable, the sharing  of expertise and resources to support  jurisdictions’ responses.  If a national cyber incident escalates in impact and  severity, the response may require escalation in  accordance with existing national crisis management  arrangements.  cyber.gov.au  |  3  De-escalating a declared  national cyber incident  When a cyber incident no longer significantly impacts,  or has the potential to significantly impact, multiple  Australian jurisdictions, and/or no longer requires a  coordinated inter-jurisdictional response, the ACSC will  issue advice to confirm the de-escalation of a national  cyber incident. This process will occur in consultation  with the NCSC.  Following the resolution of a national cyber incident,  Australian governments and the ACSC may continue to  provide the community with advice about the ongoing  impacts of a cyber incident.  Roles and  Responsibilities  The following section outlines the roles and  responsibilities of Australian governments in  responding to a national cyber incident.  State and Territory Governments  State and territory governments have primary  responsibility for the protection of life, property and  the environment within the bounds of their jurisdiction.  During a national cyber incident, NCSC members  will lead their jurisdiction’s input to the national  coordination effort.  State and territory governments will:  • control their own jurisdictional response  to an incident  • provide coordinated and consistent public  information about the incident  • support inter-jurisdictional incident coordination  via the NCSC  • provide the ACSC with information about cyber  threats, vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies,  for sharing nationally by the ACSC  • liaise with local government as necessary, and  • liaise with state and territory law enforcement  agencies to assist with any criminal investigation  into a national cyber incident.  Depending on the circumstances of a national  cyber incident, it is possible that state and territory  governments may adopt different response strategies  that reflect the different impacts of the incident on  their jurisdiction.  Where this occurs, the NCSC will coordinate national  response efforts toward a shared goal of reducing  the scope, impact and severity of national cyber  incidents on the community.  Commonwealth Government  Department of Home Affairs Home Affairs leads the coordinated development and  implementation of national cyber security policy for the Australian Government.  Australian Cyber Security Centre The ACSC is the Australian Government’s lead agency  on national cyber security operational matters.  The ACSC is part of the Australian Signals Directorate,  and includes other Commonwealth agencies in a joint  taskforce setting.  It brings together cyber security capabilities from  across the Australian Government to improve the cyber  resilience of the Australian community and support  the economic and social prosperity of Australia in  the digital age.  During a national cyber incident, the ACSC will:  • where practicable, provide technical resources  and expertise to jurisdictions that require  additional capacity or capability to respond to  a national cyber incident  • collate, analyse and share information about  cyber threats, impacts and mitigation  strategies with Australian governments,  business and the community  cyber.gov.au  |  4  cyber.gov.au  |  5  • lead public information on behalf of  the Commonwealth Government, and develop  and distribute key national messages to inform  jurisdictions’ own public messaging, and  • liaise with the Australian Intelligence Community,  federal law enforcement and overseas  jurisdictions to support national response efforts.  Joint Cyber Security Centres The ACSC’s Joint Cyber Security Centres (JCSCs), located  in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide,  bring together business and the research community  along with state, territory and Australian Government  agencies in an open and cooperative environment.  They provide a venue for local coordination activity,  and will support consequence assessment and liaison  with various organisations as necessary.  The JCSCs facilitate rapid information sharing between  governments and business, and enable organisations  to develop joint solutions to complex and shared cyber  security problems.  Business and the community  Although it does not apply to business and the  community, private entities may use the CIMA to  understand Australian governments’ response  activities during a national cyber incident.  During a national cyber incident, business and the  community remain responsible for protecting their  assets, including information stored on their systems,  from malicious cyber activity.  Business and the community should consider public  information provided by Australian governments  during a national cyber incident to inform their  understanding of:  • the circumstances of an incident  • potential risk mitigation and remediation  strategies, and  • the potential for community impacts and  warning advice.  Various resources currently exist to support business  and the community in protecting their systems from  malicious cyber activity. Important information can  be found at https://cyber.gov.au.  Strategic Principles  for using the CIMA  The CIMA’s principles provide a basis for Australian  governments’ cooperation on responses to national  cyber incidents.  Protecting Australia’s interests  In responding to a national cyber incident, Australian  governments will prioritise preserving Australia’s  national interests, including public safety, the delivery  of essential services and maintaining national security.  Shared responsibility  Australian governments have a shared responsibility  to build resilience, transparency and trust in our online  systems and, ultimately, to protect Australia from  the effects of national cyber incidents.  This responsibility also extends to business and  the community, including small, medium and large  businesses, which are responsible for maintaining  their own cyber security.  Collaboration for harm minimisation  A collaborative and mutually supportive approach  to national cyber incident management including,  where practicable, sharing expertise and resources,  will maximise the effectiveness of national response  efforts and assist in reducing the scope, impact and  severity of national cyber incidents.  Consistent public information  A coordinated approach to public information in  a national cyber incident will support consistent  messages that improve businesses’ and the  community’s understanding of the incident and  recommended actions.  cyber.gov.au  |  6  Continuous improvement  Australian governments, business and the community  are encouraged to share lessons arising from national  cyber incidents to continually improve response  arrangements. Arrangements must keep pace with  the changing cyber landscape and threat picture.  Accountable & transparent  Decision-making and actions in response to a national  cyber incident should be transparent and accountable,  subject to national security, privacy and other  legal considerations.  Benefits of  using the CIMA  Through enhanced coordination, the CIMA supports  more effective and timely responses to national cyber  incidents by providing a structured framework for  cooperation between Australian governments.  The benefits of strong strategic inter-jurisdictional  coordination include:  • improved situational awareness across  jurisdictions, which increases the effectiveness  and timeliness of response activities  • potential to prevent a national cyber incident  from escalating to a national crisis  • more efficient use of jurisdictional  response resources, and  • consistent public information from Australian  governments to business and the community,  to promote confidence and contain the potential  spread of a cyber incident.  Exercising  the Arrangements  The arrangements will be exercised and strengthened  as part of the ACSC National Exercise Program in  partnership with Australian governments, business and  international cyber security partners.  Outcomes from the exercises will inform continuous  improvement of the arrangements.  Governance  and Review  The arrangements are owned and maintained by  the NCSC.  The arrangements will be reviewed every three years  by the NCSC in consultation with relevant stakeholders.  More frequent reviews may be undertaken if required,  including following the activation or exercising of  the arrangements.  cyber.gov.au  |  7  Appendix.

ANNUAL  ACTIVITY  REPORT 2017  2  THE ANALYSES AND ASSESSMENT BY THE MANAGEMENT BOARD OF ENISA  OF THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 2017 OF  THE AUTHORISING OFFICER OF ENISA  The Management Board takes note of the Annual Activity Report (AAR) for the financial year  2017, submitted by the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) in accordance with Article 47 of the Financial Regulation applicable  to ENISA.  The Management Board received a copy of the 207 Annual Activity Report produced by the  Executive Director of ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the implementation of the  annual budget on 13 June 2018.  In analysing and assessing the AAR 2017, the Management Board makes the following  observations:  The AAR presents key results of the implementation of the ENISA Work programme 2017 and  leads to conclusion that the Agency completed all deliverables agreed with the Management  Board both within time and within budget.  ENISA produced 43 reports on different aspects of network and information security.  A relevant set of published reports, papers, workshops, meetings and events are listed as  part of the result achieved by the Agency. Impact indicators show that the Agency's results  exceeded the targets established in the Work Programme 2017, against the framework of the  ENISA Strategy 2016–2020.  At the same time, the benefits of ENISA’s work in the context of the security of network and  information systems directive (NIS directive) 1 was observed even before the deadline for its  transposition into national law of May 2018. In 2017, ENISA delivered important results in the  context of activities regarding the implementation of the NIS directive. An important element  of the NIS directive and of capacity building across the EU is the ‘Reference security incident  classification taxonomy’, which was agreed upon by ENISA and the European CSIRT community.  2017 was a year in which the previous work and impact of ENISA was reviewed by external  consultants. The successful outcome of this review was presented in the Cybersecurity  package 2, which includes a communication renewing the EU cybersecurity strategy and  the draft cybersecurity act. The draft cybersecurity act covers (i) a proposal for a renewed  mandate for a stronger ENISA to serve the cybersecurity needs of Europe and (ii)  a cybersecurity certification framework proposal.  In 2017 there was an increased focus on communicating ENISA’s work and concepts to the  European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, along with other EU agencies  and regional organisations. Following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA organised several  high-profile events such as the workshop during the 2017 EU Cybersecurity Conference in  Tallinn, in collaboration with the Estonian Presidency, two editions of the ENISA Industry Event  and the Annual Privacy Forum. ENISA also hosted 14 important thematic workshops and  sessions, gathering together experts in the field to discuss cybersecurity topics.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures for a high common  level of security of network and information systems across the Union. 2  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity#usefullinks  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 3  Two major European projects were also supported by ENISA: the EU Cyber Security Month  — a specific month dedicated to activities on cybersecurity and security/privacy awareness—  and the EU Cybersecurity Challenge event — a competition based on a series of technical  challenges between teams of students and school pupils from different Member States.  In 2017 ENISA received the EU Ombudsman Award for Good Administration for Excellence in  Innovation – Transformation.  Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work Programme 2017 and ENISA’s work is well  aligned with the overall European Union agenda for digital single market. A coherent  link is provided between activities planned in the Work Programme 2017 and the actual  achievements reached in the reporting period.  The AAR also describes ENISA’s management of resources and the budget execution of the EU  subsidy. The expenditure appropriations were committed at a rate of 99.99 %. The respective  payment rate on expenditure appropriations was 88.19 % in 2017. This section also describes  that the agency performed the ‘job screening’ benchmarking exercise for 2017. Support  functions represents 19.28 % of the total statutory staff count, which is below the 25 %  maximum value accepted for the European Union agencies.  The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2015 Discharge, and control results. The agency had  no open recommendations from the Internal Audit Service in 2017. This section also notes the  main categories of deviation that led to exceptions reported. In 2017 the agency recorded 31  exceptions. 25 of them are under the materiality levels and are minor administrative mistakes.  Of the six remaining, three a posteriori commitments were reported, two were late payments  to the European Commission and the last was a purchase order on which the amount exceeded  the limit.  The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate management of risks, high level of  transparency, data protection, business continuity, as well as efforts were undertaken to  improve overall efficiency in all activities.  The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration of assurance of the Executive Director as  well as additional information on human and financial resources, draft annual accounts and  financial reports, as well as performance information included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the achievements of ENISA in 2017. In the view  of the Management Board, the overall performance and quality of the outputs was high.  The Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA could deliver work programme  2017 in spite of high staff turnover and under condition of limited budgetary resources. The  Management Board expresses its appreciation to the Executive Director and his staff for their  commitment and achievements throughout the year.  The Management Board notes that the Executive Director has no critical issues to report which  would affect the presentation of the annual accounts for the financial year 2017 to the discharge  authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management Board requests the Management Board  Secretariat to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to the European Commission, the  European Parliament, the Council, the Permanent Representations of the Member States and  the Court of Auditors.  41  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 51  TABLE OF CONTENTS ENISA Management board assessment 2 A message from the Executive Director 8 Introduction 11  PART I  ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2017 WORK  PROGRAMME 17  1.1  KEY RESULTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 1 — EXPERTISE: ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT  EUROPE IN FACING EMERGING NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY CHALLENGES 18 1.1.1 Objective 1.1.

On 13 September 2017 the Commission adopted a cybersecurity package 3, which  includes a communication renewing the EU cybersecurity strategy and the draft  cybersecurity act. The package builds upon existing instruments and presents new  initiatives to further improve EU cyber resilience and response. The draft cybersecurity  act covers (i) a proposal for a renewed mandate for a stronger ENISA to serve the  cybersecurity needs of Europe and (ii) a cybersecurity certification framework proposal.  The proposed act promotes a permanent and updated mandate for the agency, which  has now been given political support at the highest level with the adoption of the Council  conclusions.  2017 was also a year in which the previous work and impact of ENISA was reviewed by  external consultants. The successful outcome of this review supports and is evidence of  what we all believed, namely that ENISA has made a positive contribution to cybersecurity  in Europe over the last several years.  The success of our agency is built on the efforts, dedication and commitment of all staff  members, on the stimulating collaboration with its stakeholders and on the effective  strategic cooperation with the Management Board. I would like to take this opportunity to  thank all of them for their significant contributions and efforts in 2017.  ENISA reached its main objective in 2017: it successfully completed the work programme  in a timely manner and within the constraints of its budget. Please find in the  introduction section a summary with highlights of ENISA activities during 2017, and in the  next sections details on how they were carried out.  In the broader context, more work is required to secure cyberspace and guarantee a safe  and secure digital economy for EU citizens.  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity#usefullinks  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity#usefullinks  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 9  During 2017 we witnessed several large-scale ransomware attacks that affected critical  functions of our society such as hospitals and transportation. At the same time, the  materialisation of internet of things (IoT) attacks has given a further demonstration of the  potential damage that can result from malevolent manipulation of this technology.  More work is required to address these new challenges. At the same time, we are also  seeing the benefits of the work in the context of the security of network and information  systems directive (NIS directive) 4 emerging even before the deadline for its transposition  into national law of May 2018. In 2017 ENISA delivered important results in the context of  activities regarding the implementation of the NIS directive. For instance, ENISA produced  a number of deliverables supporting the work streams established in the Cooperation  Group 5, namely incident notification, baseline security measures and identification of  operators of essential service provides.  As we look towards the future, there is no doubt that 2018 will be a challenging year.  With our staff and our stakeholders we will support the implementation of the renewed  EU cybersecurity strategy while looking forward to the adoption of the proposed  cybersecurity act.  I believe in the future of ENISA, and I am looking forward to the proposed new stronger  ENISA and to the agency playing its role in the safe EU cyberspace of tomorrow.  Udo Helmbrecht Executive Director, European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  4 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union. 5 The official body providing guidance on the EU-wide efforts related to the implementation of the NIS  directive.  101  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 111  THE EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  IN BRIEF  The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) was established in 2004  by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European  Parliament and the Council. Regulation (EU)  No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security  introduced a small change in the name, updated its  objectives and extended its mandate until 19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and  information security and cybersecurity in Europe.  ENISA supports the European Union and its Member  States in enhancing and strengthening their ability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond  to network and information security problems and  incidents. ENISA’s vision is to secure and enable  Europe’s information society and to use its unique  competencies to help to drive the cyber landscape  in Europe.  The agency works closely with members of both  the public and private sectors to deliver advice and  guidelines based on solid operational experience. ENISA  also supports the development of EU policies and  laws on matters relating to network and information  security (NIS), thereby contributing to economic growth  in the EU’s internal market. Last but not least, ENISA  coordinates the pan-European cybersecurity exercise,  which is unique in its scope and impact and brings  together all of the EU Member States every 2 years to  test their cooperation mechanisms while working in  their own operational environments.  In 2017 there was an increased focus on  communicating ENISA’s work and concepts to the  European Parliament, the Council and the European  Commission, along with other EU agencies and  regional organisations. Regular meetings with various  Commission services, and with the Directorate- General for Communications Networks, Content and  Technology in particular, took place during the year.  THE YEAR IN BRIEF  The key achievements of 2017 are as follows.  ENISA produced 43 reports on different aspects of  NIS. These include the latest version of the ENISA  threat landscape, guidelines and best-practice  recommendations regarding privacy-enhancing  technologies. Additionally, ENISA reports focused  on issues including but not limited to security and  privacy in mobile environments, standardisation  (including aspects of the eIDAS regulation 6 and  the emerging area of certification of products.  6 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and  of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market.  INTRODUCTION  12  ENISA initiated the process of assisting Member  States in implementing the security of network  and information systems directive (NIS directive),  the first piece of EU-wide legislation on  cybersecurity that provides legal measures to  boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  As defined by the NIS directive, in its role as  secretariat of the computer security incident  response teams (CSIRTs) network, ENISA has  engaged all 28 EU Member States and their  designated CSIRTs, together with EU institutions,  in the development of rules and procedures on  implementing the NIS directive by supporting  operational cooperation among EU Member  States during cyber crises such as WannaCry  and NotPetya, supporting working groups and  dedicated meetings.  ENISA supported the organisation of CSIRTs  network meetings, including the first meeting  in Malta, the second in Estonia and the third  in Greece. The third meeting took place at the  campus of ENISA’s headquarters in Heraklion,  Greece, and saw the participation of CSIRT  representatives from all EU Member States,  the European Commission and the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (CERT-EU).  An important element of the NIS directive and of  capacity building across the EU is the ‘Reference  security incident classification taxonomy’, which  was agreed upon by ENISA and the European  CSIRT community.  Following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA  organised several high-profile events such as  the workshop during the 2017 EU Cybersecurity  Conference in Tallinn, in collaboration with the  Estonian Presidency, two editions of the ENISA  Industry Event and the Annual Privacy Forum.  ENISA also hosted 14 important thematic  workshops and sessions, gathering together  experts in the field to discuss cybersecurity topics.  Two major European projects were also supported  by ENISA: the EU Cyber Security Month — a  specific month dedicated to activities on  cybersecurity and security/privacy awareness —  and the EU Cybersecurity Challenge event — a  competition based on a series of technical  challenges between teams of students and school  pupils from different Member States.  Finally, ENISA compiled a data breach severity  assessment tool, in close collaboration with  several Member States’ data protection  authorities, with the aim of setting up a coherent  framework at EU level.  While not being exhaustive, these achievements  amply illustrate the variety of ways in which the  agency contributes to a stronger and more secure EU.  Achievement of strategic priorities  and objectives  In 2017 the agency delivered against its annual work  programme, and all outputs and deliverables met or  exceeded the key performance indicators set (see  Part I for more details). Notable achievements are  mentioned hereunder, along with examples of how  the agency reached its goals.  ENISA continued to deliver on the priorities of its  strategy, including work in areas supporting the  digital single market (and on specific technologies  such as the IoT), incident reporting, eIDAS regulation,  privacy and trust. 2017 was a year that saw ENISA  supporting the implementation of the NIS directive  in regard to baseline security measures, incident  reporting and the identification of criteria for  operators of essential services (OES). The agency  also supported the Member States and the European  Commission on the NIS directive provisions related to  digital service providers.  Key achievements include the following.  In the context of the NIS directive, the agency  produced a number of deliverables supporting  the work of the respective working streams  established within the Cooperation Group, namely  incident notification, baseline security measures  and the identification of OES (see performance  indicator for outputs O.1.1.1, O.2.2.2 and O.2.2.6).  In supporting the implementation of the NIS  directive ENISA also engaged stakeholders in  specific OES sectors (e.g. air transport, finance and  healthcare) to better understand and document  examples of sectorial specificities vis-à-vis the  sectorial requirements. Relevant input is provided  to the Cooperation Group (horizontal and sectorial  standards) to enhance its specific knowledge  of these sectors (see performance indicator for  output O.2.2.6).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 13  INTRODUCTION  As part of its activities to develop baseline security  recommendations for the IoT in the context of  critical information infrastructure, ENISA organised  together with Europol an IoT Security conference  that was attended by over 250 participants and  achieved significant visibility in the community.  Also, more than 30 IoT stakeholders and experts  were involved in the relevant study, including  the ENISA IoT Security Experts Group and the  European Commission’s DG Communications  Networks, Content and Technology (see  performance indicator for output O.1.1.2).  ENISA published a study to promote the uptake  of cyber insurance by assessing the level of  harmonisation of the risk assessment language  in cyber insurance and supporting further  convergence in the industry. The study has been  widely referenced and the recommendations  have been adopted by associations promoting  harmonised wordings. The respective validation  workshop received significant visibility and was  attended by over 50 participants, including 24  insurance companies and 41 companies from  14 Member States overall, while a total of 51  insurance carriers, brokers and reinsurers from  12 Member States participated in the study (see  performance indicator for output O.3.3.2).  ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies (NCSS) and updated the  EU NCSS map. The new version of the map was  built on the work performed in previous years and  presents the Member States’ strategic objectives  and good practices in a simple and user-friendly  manner. In addition, ENISA, in cooperation  with the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre,  organised a workshop in The Hague attended by  more than 40 public and private stakeholders.  Overall, 18 Member States participated in the  activities of the agency regarding this output (see  performance indicator for output O.3.1.3).  For the sixth year, ENISA published its annual  report on significant outage incidents in the  European electronic communications sector,  which are reported to ENISA and the European  Commission under Article 13a of the framework  directive (Directive 2009/140/EC) by the national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) of the different EU  Member States (see performance indicator for  output O.1.2.2).  Based on the significant incidents reported by the  supervisory bodies of the different EU Member  States, ENISA produced the first annual incident  analysis report for trust service providers in  the EU under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation  (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014). This report also  placed emphasis on the analysis of the recently  established incident-reporting procedure itself in  an effort to highlight its peculiarities.  More than 100 participants in the 2017 Annual  Privacy Forum: (researchers, policymakers and  industry participants).  Key conclusions on the effectiveness  of the internal control systems and  financial management  ENISA has consolidated internal control standards  (ICS), based on international good practice, that aim  to ensure that policy and operational objectives are  achieved within the applicable legal and financial  framework.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory and the agency  consistently meets its goals in full.  The agency has put in place an organisational  structure and a set of internal controls that are suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives,  are in accordance with the standards and are suitable  for mitigating risks associated with the environment  in which it operates.  The current set of 16 ICS lays down the minimum  requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2017 the agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise and on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies (the  Internal Audit Service of the European Commission  (IAS) and the European Court of Auditors (ECA)). The  agency continues to enjoy full compliance without  audit observation and/or audit qualifications.  14  Notable internal and external events  2017 will stay in cybersecurity history as the year of  ransomware: the year saw large-scale ransomware  attacks that affected critical functions of our society  such as hospitals and transportation. At the same  time, the materialisation of IoT attacks gave a  further demonstration of the potential resulting  from manipulation of this technology. Some further  highlights of the year related to cybersecurity were  as follows.  2017 was a pivotal year regarding the  implementation of NIS directive. Member States  used the platform offered by the Cooperation  Group to discuss good practices relevant to the  transposition of the directive into national law with  a view to achieving a higher level of convergence  as the transposition deadline of May 2018  draws closer.  The year witnessed several highly publicised IoT  security attacks on both commercial products  and critical infrastructure, thus raising relevant  concerns and leading to calls for action towards  stronger cybersecurity for connected objects, as  clearly indicated in the mid-term review of the  digital single market.  2017 was a year in which the operational  cooperation of the CSIRTs network was tested  during cyber crises such as WannaCry and  NotPetya. The CSIRTs network proved its readiness  and ability to cooperate during large-scale security  incidents in the EU.  As underlined by the latest ENISA threat landscape,  2017 was the year in which incidents in the  cyberthreat landscape led to the definitive recognition  of some omnipresent facts. The agency gained  specific evidence regarding monetisation methods,  attacks on democracies, cyberwar, the transformation  of malicious infrastructure and the dynamics  within threat-agent groups. At the same time a lot  of successful operations against cybercriminals  were launched. Law enforcement, governments  and vendors managed to shut down illegal dark  markets, deanonymise the darknet and arrest  prominent cybercriminals. Moreover, state-sponsored  campaigns were revealed and details of technologies  deployed by nation states were leaked.  Nonetheless, despite law enforcement activities and  capability building, the cybersecurity market is failing:  implemented measures and increased investment  have not yet brought a decline in successful incidents.  The cybersecurity community — with the support of  ENISA — has to continue its fight against cybercrime  in a coordinated manner. Cybersecurity skill shortage  is aggravating the race towards inverting current  cyber-incident trends.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 15  INTRODUCTION  I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 17  1. PART I PART I ACHIEVEMENTS  IN THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE 2017 WORK  PROGRAMME  This Consolidated annual activity report 2017 follows  the structure of the amended 7 2017 ENISA work  programme to assist the reader in understanding  the achievements of the year. The 2017 work  programme was aligned with the structure of the  ENISA strategy document 8, which was created with  the aim of supporting ENISA’s Executive Director  and Management Board in the production and  adoption of consistent multiannual and annual  work programmes 9. This strategy defines five  strategic objectives that form the basis of future  multiannual plans 10.  These strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA  regulation, along with inputs from the Member States  and relevant communities, including the private  sector. They state that ENISA, in cooperation with  and in support of the Member States and the Union  institutions, will carry out the following tasks.  7 The work programme was amended in September 2017 to  address the changes in ENISA’s activities linked to the agency’s  new role as defined in the Computer Emergency Response Team  for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU) regulation. 8 ENISA strategy 2016-2020, available at: https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  9 In accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning ENISA. 10 In order to achieve the multiannual strategic objectives laid  out in this document, the multiannual work programme provides  prioritised mid-term operational objectives to be achieved  by ENISA within a period of 3 years. Annual specific activities  (outputs) are identified in the annual work programme, using a  recursive approach in order to achieve the mid-term operational  objectives and, in the long term, the strategic objectives.  #Expertise: anticipate and support Europe in  facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the  evolutions of the digital environment.  #Policy: promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the EU  institutions and Member States in developing and  implementing EU policies and law related to NIS.  #Capacity: support Europe in maintaining state-of- the-art network and information security capacities,  by assisting the EU institutions and Member States in  reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community: foster the emerging European network  and information security community, by reinforcing  cooperation at EU level among EU institutions,  Member States and relevant NIS stakeholders,  including the private sector.  #Enabling: reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving  the management of its resources and engaging  more efficiently with its stakeholders, including the  EU institutions and Member States, as well as at  international level.  In the following sections the results of the  implementation of the 2017 work programme are  presented for each of the abovementioned activities.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  18  After the description of the specific results for  each activity and output, the achievements against  indicators and the detailed results for each output are  presented in tables.  Furthermore, the 2016 work programme impact  indicators for which a target value was set for 2017 or  2018 have been included in Section 2.6 to follow up  their result and impact. These can only be measured  in the medium and long term.  1.1 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 1 —  EXPERTISE: ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT  EUROPE IN FACING EMERGING  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  CHALLENGES  1.1.1 Objective 1.1. Improving the  expertise related to critical information  infrastructure  1.1.1.1 Output O.1.1.1 — Baseline security  recommendations for the operators of essential  services sectors  The key objective of this output was to assist the  Member States by providing guidance and supporting  material on the implementation of Articles 14(1)  and (2) of the NIS directive, which refer to measures  with a view to achieving a high common level of NIS  security within the EU. ENISA achieved this objective  by engaging with the NIS directive Cooperation  Group and private stakeholders and by leveraging  its existing knowledge and expertise in the area of  standards and good practices on security measures  and risk assessment.  Specifically, the agency supported the Cooperation  Group by collecting and analysing the current and often  common approaches to the security measures of OES.  The outcome of these activities significantly helped the  Cooperation Group to produce a reference document  with security measures for public and private actors to  improve their cybersecurity. All 28 Member States and  17 OES from various essential sectors were engaged  in the development of baseline security requirements  for OES. A workshop for the energy sector was  held in Athens in September and was attended by  representatives of 14 Member States and 21 OES.  Finally, ENISA provided detailed examples of  implementation, lists and mapping tables of  standards and good practices on risk-assessment and  risk-management methodologies relevant to these  security measures.  1.1.1.2 Output O.1.1.2 — Baseline security  recommendations for IoT in the context of critical  information infrastructure  ENISA defines the IoT as a cyber-physical ecosystem  of interconnected sensors and actuators, which  enables intelligent decision-making. With a great  impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy, the  IoT threat landscape is extremely complex. Therefore,  it is important to understand what exactly needs  to be secured and to implement specific security  measures to protect the IoT from cyberthreats. The  2017 ENISA report on IoT cybersecurity provides  experts, developers, manufacturers, decision- makers and security personnel with a guide to good  practices and recommendations on preventing and  mitigating cyberattacks against the IoT. This report  lists the sensitive assets present in the IoT, as well  as the corresponding threats, risks, attack scenarios,  mitigation factors and possible security measures  to implement. More than 30 IoT stakeholders and  experts from more than 10 Member States were  involved in the study, including the ENISA IoT Security  Experts Group and DG Communications Networks,  Content and Technology. Moreover, more than 250  participants attended the IoT Security conference  that ENISA organised together with Europol in  October. The deployment of baseline security  recommendations into the IoT ecosystem will be  critical to the proper functioning of these devices  by mitigating and preventing cyberattacks. The  March 2018 UK government report Secure by design:  improving the cybersecurity of consumer internet of  things took stock of the ENISA study on baseline  security recommendations, along with several other  ENISA studies, for example on smart cars, airports  and hospitals. ENISA received an invitation to and  presented the Baseline security recommendations  for IoT study at the Mobile World Congress 2018 in  Barcelona, an event that attracted more than 107 000  participants.  1.1.2 Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape  and analysis  1.1.2.1 Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA  threat landscape  The ENISA threat landscape (ETL) report enjoys major  attention within Member States and the Commission,  and also among experts and lay communities. This  objective follows up on past achievements to deliver  an overview of the cyberthreat landscape, along with  a series of related information. This material seeks to  be very comprehensive.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 19  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  In 2017 the ETL was further developed to include  more interactive elements both in the presentation  and in the dissemination of related information.  The impact of the ENISA TL is varied.  It is used as a consolidated summary of existing  material in the area of cyberthreats.  It provides strategic and tactical information that  can be used within security-management tasks.  It can be imported into risk-management  methods.  It can be used as basis for building up threat  intelligence.  It can be used for training purposes.  The ENISA collection and analysis process can be  used by other organisations to create their own  threat landscapes.  In 2017 the team developing the ETL organised  the first European event in the area of cyberthreat  intelligence to address challenges and open issues  in the related community. The success of the event  has exceeded expectations by having some 150  participants who delivered vivid discussions and a  comprehensive exchange of knowledge and ideas.  The ETL provides information regarding reduction  of threat exposure. This information consists of  available controls that can reduce the exposure  and consequently mitigate the resulting risks. In  addition to the report the agency made available to  the public all relevant material as it was collected  during the year.  In carrying out this work, synergies with related  experts (i.e. the ENISA TL Stakeholder Group) and  vendors have been exploited. The agency will  invest in visualisation and quick availability of the  resulting material.  In 2017 the ENISA threat landscape was accompanied  by an end-user application (a web application  available at https://etl.enisa.europa.eu) that will  provide available information online. In this manner  ETL users will be in the position to access ENISA threat  information on a permanent basis. This platform may  be used to integrate additional relevant information.  The ETL continues to be a key deliverable. It has been  referenced by stakeholders from all Member States.  Several thousand downloads and several hundred  references have been made. Moreover, various  articles have reported on ENISA TL findings.  As an indicator, the ETL has achieved following  impact.  ENISA threat landscape is cited in the UK  cybersecurity strategy.  ENISA threat landscape is mentioned in a  Commission fact sheet about cybersecurity.  ENISA threat landscape delivers input for topics  under the Horizon 2020 programme.  ENISA threat landscape information is being used  by the Council to raise awareness.  ENISA threat landscape is used as material for  cybersecurity courses in universities.  ENISA threat landscape is cited on Wikipedia.  1.1.2.2 Output O.1.2.2 — Annual incident analysis  report for the telecom sector (Article 13a)  For the sixth year, ENISA published its annual report  on significant outage incidents in the European  electronic communications sector, which are reported  to ENISA and the European Commission under  Article 13a of the framework directive (Directive  2009/140/EC) by the NRAs of the different EU  Member States. The 2017 report covers the incidents  that occurred in the previous year and gives an  aggregated analysis of the incident reports about  severe outages across the EU.  Some key findings from the 158 major incidents  reported include the identification of mobile internet as  the service most affected by such outages and system  failures as the dominant root cause of incidents.  The annual incident analysis report is compiled based  on the data provided by Member States. In order to  facilitate collection and strengthen the relationship  The ETL continues to  be a key deliverable.  It has been referenced  by stakeholders from  all Member States.  Several thousand  downloads and several  hundred references  have been made.  https://etl.enisa.europa.eu  20  with NRAs, ENISA organised three meetings during  the year, attended by almost all EU NRAs. The agency  also developed an online tool so Member States can  submit their incidents online.  1.1.2.3 Output O.1.2.3 — Annual incident analysis  report for trust service providers (Article 19)  This report provides an analysis and evaluation of  the incident-reporting procedure in the EU under  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation. Considering the fact  that incident reporting was only implemented as from  the second half of 2016, and moreover that this was  the first time that supervisory bodies had performed  this exercise, only one incident was notified to ENISA.  Future incidents reported under the provisions of  Article 19, especially those with cross-border impact,  could potentially have a highly damaging impact.  Therefore, ENISA is paying a lot of attention to the  particularities of Article 19-related incidents, as even  apparently non-critical incidents can create significant  impact across multiple Member States.  In order to facilitate this process ENISA manages a  subject-matter expert group from the authorities from  most of the Member States. The group meets twice a  year to debate the incidents, along with other topics.  1.1.3 Objective 1.3. Research and  development, innovation  1.1.3.1 Output O.1.3.1 — Guidelines for European  standardisation in the field of ICT security  This activity provided an assessment of the situation  of European standardisation in the area of ICT  security, taking into account the new requirements  and priorities associated with the NIS directive  (and with the Commission’s communication on the  Cybersecurity Public–Private Partnership (cPPP). In  addition, the output of European standardisation  in the area of trust services was analysed with a  view to establishing suitability and coherence with  policy goals.  While carrying out this work, ENISA consulted with  industry and standards organisations (e.g. the  European Telecommunications Standards Institute  (ETSI), the European Committee for Standardisation  (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardisation (Cenelec)) as appropriate, mainly  through expertise that was mobilised to produce  reports, and standardisation conferences (e.g. ETSI  Security Week).  1.1.3.2 Output O.1.3.2 — Priorities for EU  research and development  In 2017 ENISA worked closely with the European  Cyber Security Organisation and the cPPP on  cybersecurity in order to align the work being carried  out with the ENISA work programme. In addition,  the agency offered support to the National Public  Authority Representatives Committee by offering a  secretariat function.  Also during the year ENISA looked into current best  practices and guidelines for protecting EU systems  and networks, and put in place an analysis of areas  covered by the NIS directive, such the general  data protection regulation and the Commission’s  decision on the cPPP, and provided guidance on  where research and development activities funded  in the context of the Horizon 2020 programme,  the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), Training of  Network Security Incident Teams Staff and the Gigabit  European Academic Network would achieve the  greatest impact.  1.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response  to Article 14 requests under  expertise activity  1.1.4.1 Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests  under expertise activity  The outcomes of the Article 14 requests under policy  activity for 2017 are as follows.  Following a request from the green parties of  the European Parliament, a briefing note about  artificial intelligence was provided covering  different aspects of the impact of this technology,  including economic, social and privacy issues. The  discussion was continued at the Annual Privacy  Forum in Vienna and in subsequent meetings.  ENISA received a request from the European  Commission to study and measure the impact of  key reinstallation attack vulnerability in order to  provide further advice to citizens. An info note  was created giving detailed information about the  issue and providing different lines of actuation  in order to prevent and mitigate the impact of  the vulnerability.

Supporting EU policy  development  ENISA continued to provide the Commission and  the Member States with high-quality information,  data and advice to support policymaking with an  EU dimension.  In the policy development area the agency  cooperated with public- and private-sector  stakeholders to develop insights, consolidate views  and provide recommendations in areas in which the  EU takes action to further develop its policy. Examples  of such cooperation included the domains of IT  security certification and the digital single market.  1.2.1.1 Output O.2.1.1 — Support the policy  discussions in the area of IT security certification  The work of ENISA gained new impetus through  the proposed cybersecurity act, which also includes  an important component on the EU cybersecurity  certification framework. This proposal complements  other recent legislative and policy initiatives, such as  the NIS directive and the Commission position on  the cPPP. The agency is gradually becoming more  empowered to continue supporting the Commission  and the Member States in identifying a certification  framework for ICT security products and services  that on the one hand boost competition, and on the  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/mapping-of-oes-security-requirements-to-specific-sectors/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2017/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-reports-2016 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-analysis-report-for-the-trust-service-providers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/improving-recognition-of-ict-security-standards/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/priorities-for-eu-research/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-article-14-requests/  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 23  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  other promote mutual recognition or harmonisation  of certification practices up to a certain level. The way  conformity assessment is carried out in European  certification laboratories was an area of specific  policy activity; it complemented involvement with  stakeholders in two different certification workshops  throughout 2017.  ENISA also reached out, with the discussion on  certification, to standardisation organisations  (ETSI etc.), ICT certification stakeholders (test labs,  certification and accreditation bodies, the Senior  Officials Group Information Systems Security,  Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, etc.)  and ICT security product users (the European Smart  Metering Industry Group, Eurosmart, etc.) as forums  to enhance the dialogue around security certification  and build upon the existing results these initiatives  have developed in the past.  1.2.1.2 Output O.2.1.2 — Restricted: towards a  digital single market for high-quality NIS products  and services  ENISA conducted a study to perform a thorough  mapping of the EU NIS start-up ecosystem in the  EU using a multifaceted approach that addressed  technology and innovation aspects, the policy and  regulatory context and the funding side from a  Member State, EU and private-sector perspective in  light of the digital single market strategy. The study  focused on identifying the opportunities available  to EU NIS start-ups and the obstacles potentially  hindering their growth prospects. Twenty-four  individual start-ups and 10 funding-side organisations  (including key venture capitalists and business  accelerators) covering 10 sectors participated in  the study, either via interviews or by attending the  validation workshop.  This report helped ENISA to advise the Commission  and Member States in better identifying where  efforts should be focused in order to further  support NIS innovation within the EU and allow  start-ups to reach their full potential by leveraging  the opportunities that arise from the digital single  market. Start-up Europe, the Commission’s initiative  designed to connect start-ups, investors, accelerators,  entrepreneurs etc., expressed significant interest in  the findings and recommendations and has adopted  a number of them as guidelines for future activities.  The report proposed guidelines and  recommendations to strengthen NIS innovation  within the EU, while a workshop was organised and  co-hosted by DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology’s Start-ups and Innovation Unit to  bring together different stakeholders from the NIS  start-up ecosystem and present the main findings.  1.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy  implementation  1.2.2.1 Output O.2.2.1 — Contribute to EU policy in  the area of the electronic communications sector  Since 2011 ENISA has supported work in the area  of the electronic communication sector. In this  respect, three meetings were organised with the  Article 13a Expert Group and one technical project  was developed (interconnect security dealing  with SS7/Diameter) in 2017. Overall, 38 electronic  communications providers and 28 national bodies  (NRAs) participated in the study. Since the results of  the study are still being debated and validated with  the industry and national authorities, the study will be  published later in 2018.  A strong relationship has been developed with the  Commission and multiple inputs have been provided  as regards the development of the new EU Electronic  Communications Code. Every year ENISA tackles  at least one technical topic, as recommended by  Article 13a (e.g. a topic that represents a concern to  many authorities across the EU).  In 2017 ENISA also continued its work in the area  of privacy in electronic communications (e-privacy)  and provided relevant technical opinions on online  tracking and relevant user protection mechanisms.  1.2.2.2 Output O.2.2.2 — Develop guidelines  for the implementation of mandatory incident  reporting  ENISA is an active member of the Cooperation Group,  the official body providing guidance on EU-wide  efforts related to implementing the NIS directive.  Within the incident notification working stream  established within the Cooperation Group, ENISA  produced the deliverable Reference document on  incident notification for operators of essential services,  which serves as a main guideline for Member States  when addressing the topic of incident notification.  The document provides insights on how incident- notification provisions can be implemented at  national level, highlights potential discrepancies in  terms of incident reporting across different industries  and further contributes to EU-wide harmonisation.  The work represents a landmark in the work on  incident reporting within the NIS directive, as more  documents remain to be produced in the next years.  24  It sets the baseline on further developing incident  reporting policies across the Member States.  The document was produced based on input from the  Member States and taking into account the previous  work done by the agency in the area of telecom and  trust service providers. The work in this working  stream was coordinated by the Dutch representation  in the Cooperation Group. Overall, 49 private  stakeholders and 20 public stakeholders contributed  to the study.  1.2.2.3 Output O.2.2.3 — Recommendations  supporting implementation of the eIDAS  regulation  ENISA supported public and private bodies in  implementing the eIDAS regulation by addressing  technological aspects and building blocks for  trust services.  Furthermore, ENISA developed a set of  recommendations and guidelines addressed to the  all the involved stakeholders: trust service providers,  supervisory bodies and conformity assessment  bodies. More than 20 experts in the area of trust  services stakeholders were involved in preparing and  validating the reports. The reports were disseminated  through different communication channels, with the  European Commission’s distribution channels being  the DG Informatics–Communication and Information  Resource Centre for Administrations, Businesses  and Citizens mailing list, the Article 19 ENISA Expert  Group mailing list and ENISA contacts through the  Trust Services  Forum. The findings of the reports  were presented in several different workshops and  conferences, including the Trust Services Forum, the  Article 19 ENISA Expert Group, ETSI Security Week,  World e-ID and Trust Services compliance info day on  eIDAS. Moreover, a survey was carried out to examine  the implementation and uptake of trust services  under the eIDAS regulation.  1.2.2.4 Output O.2.2.4 — Recommendations for  technical implementation of the general data  protection regulation  Technical measures in the area of data protection  have been a key part of the involvement of ENISA  in this policy area in an effort to support the  implementation of the general data protection  regulation. ENISA made available a set of  recommendations that allow data controllers and  data processors to properly support such aspects  as consent, right to erasure, data portability, data  breaches, accountability, anonymisation versus  pseudonymisation, etc. ENISA also continued its  work on privacy-enhancing technologies, apps and  methods, along with certification for data protection  to provide stakeholders with the necessary support.  1.2.2.5 Output O.2.2.5 — Privacy-enhancing  technologies  ENISA has delivered practical guidelines on how to  implement privacy and data protection by design and  default. In 2017 the agency developed a community  building tool prototype that aims to create and  maintain a repository of best available techniques  for privacy-enhancing technologies, further building  on evaluating new techniques and keeping lists of  techniques available. The practical functionalities of  this tool were tested.  In this fifth edition, the Annual Privacy Forum was  used to bring together key communities across  research, policy and the industry to disseminate work  in this area.  1.2.2.6 Output O.2.2.6 — Supporting the  implementation of the NIS directive  In 2017 ENISA built on the work performed during  the previous years with the aim of supporting the NIS  Directive Cooperation Group by providing guidance  and supplemental material on the implementation of  Articles 5 and 6 of the NIS directive, which refer to the  identification of OES.  In this respect ENISA collected the well-established  approaches different Member States use to identify  their OES. In total, 19 Member States participated  in this study. The agency analysed the collected  information and identified common features that  could constitute a basis for a harmonised approach.  The outcome of this work was the key feedback into  the activities of the NIS Directive Cooperation Group  work stream on the identification of OES.  This work was not concluded in 2017 but will continue  in 2018. During this period ENISA will continue  helping Member States to develop more knowledge  and expertise on this topic and will contribute by  providing input to the activities of the Cooperation  Group work stream.  Furthermore, ENISA, in its activities to support  the implementation of the NIS directive, engaged  stakeholders from the air transport, finance and  healthcare sectors to understand the respective  sectorial specificities. A set of recommendations  and good practices, related to incident reporting  for instance, has already been provided to the  Cooperation Group to enhance its knowledge of  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 25  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  the cybersecurity situation in each of the sectors of  the NIS directive. Additional recommendations and  good practices will be provided to the Cooperation  Group if requested as the focus shifts from the  horizontal aspects of the NIS directive to sectorial  implementation in 2018.  Under these activities ENISA organised two very  successful workshops, contributing to the discussions  on the implementation of the NIS directive. The first  one was the annual meeting of the ENISA expert  group on finance, where the need to streamline  the requirements of the NIS directive and the  payment services directive II was raised. The second  workshop was the third edition of the eHealth  security workshop, which was this year co-hosted  with the Portuguese Ministry of Health. The workshop  reached a large number of relevant stakeholders.  Furthermore, ENISA has raised awareness of the  NIS directive by participating in workshops with  hospital representatives in Belgium, Greece, Latvia  and Portugal. In the air transport sector the request  for cybersecurity training in collaboration with the  European Aviation Safety Agency was the highlight of  a very successful year. ENISA will continue to support  these sectors in implementing the NIS directive in the  coming years.  1.2.3 Objective 2.3. Response to Article  14 requests under policy activity  1.2.3.1 Output O.2.3.1 — Response to requests  under policy activity  The 2017 outcomes of the Article 14 requests under  policy activity are as follows.  ENISA supported the establishment of the NIS  directive Cooperation Group work stream on the  dependency of OES and digital service providers  on operators that function across borders in EU.  In particular, after a formal request (cf. Article 14  of the agency’s regulation) from Estonia, ENISA  drafted the proof-of-concept paper for this area  of activity. The paper demonstrates the need  for such a work stream, in the context of the NIS  Cooperation Group, by illustrating the complexity  and the challenges around this subject matter.  Following a request from the European Central  Bank, ENISA has started providing expertise in the  development of a Eurosystem red team testing  framework for financial market infrastructures.  ENISA is involved in validating and enriching the red  teaming framework, which involves the Bank and  all 28 Member States’ central financial authorities.  ENISA’s contribution consists of meetings at the  Bank’s premises and providing comments and  input on follow-up documents. The work is ongoing  as the request will require activities through the  first and second quarters of 2018.  Following a request from the Greek Ministry  of Health, ENISA prepared a full-day workshop  focusing on the NIS directive and the healthcare  sector. The workshop served the purpose of raising  awareness regarding the NIS directive among  key stakeholders from the sector in Greece. To  that end ENISA gave a detailed presentation of  the directive and the relevant provisions to an  audience of over 80 representatives of Greek  hospitals and other healthcare organisations,  and coordinated a discussion on cybersecurity in  healthcare focusing on the main challenges and  the exchange of good practices.  ENISA received a request from the Commission’s  Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety  to support the eHealth Network’s activities  on cybersecurity for healthcare, which will be  carried out within the joint action on eHealth  (health programme 2017). Specifically, ENISA has  been asked to actively participate in Task 7.3,  ‘Data and system security’, of work package 7,  which addresses the issues on ‘Implementation  challenges and impact’. Activities related to this  request will begin in 2018.  Following a request from the European Aviation  Safety Agency, ENISA has been assisting that  agency on the subjects of sectorial implementation  of the NIS directive and cybersecurity in aviation.  In this context ENISA is currently supporting the  creation of the European Aviation’s information  sharing and analysis centres (ISACs), which will  provide a platform for cybersecurity information  exchange across Europe. Moreover, ENISA is  organising dedicated cybersecurity training  courses for the aviation sector. A first training  course for air carriers took place in 2017 in  collaboration with the European Aviation Safety  Agency. Due to the high demand a second one will  be organised in the second quarter of 2018. Topics  also include cybersecurity for avionics (training  led by the European Aviation Safety Agency) and  artefact analysis (forensics led by ENISA).  26  1.2.4 General results: achievement of performance indicators for Activity 2  Summary of outputs in Activity 2 — Policy: promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority Outputs Performance indicator Achieved results  Objective 2.1.

Assist Member  States’ capacity building  One of the main goals of this objective was to develop  and improve activities related to the operational  security capacity-support programme. In 2017 ENISA  continued to build upon its work in the operational  security area by providing technical training materials  for CSIRTs to support the improvement of technical  skills across Europe. The goal is to support Member  States through a dialogue with relevant stakeholders  in order to be ready for the technical challenges of  the coming years. Another main goal of this objective  was to help the EU Member States and other ENISA  stakeholders, such as the EU institutions, bodies  and agencies, to develop and extend the necessary  capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing  challenges of securing their networks.  1.3.1.1 Output O.3.1.1 — Support national and  governmental CSIRTs capabilities  In 2017 ENISA concentrated its efforts on assisting  CSIRTs by, for example, leveraging its role as  secretariat of the CSIRTs network as defined in the  NIS directive. In close cooperation with CSIRTs, the  agency supported the development of Member  States’ national incident response capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions  of NIS capacity building with a focus on the  development and efficient functioning of national and  governmental CSIRTs.  The main objective of this output in 2017 was to help  Member States and other ENISA stakeholders, such  as EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop  and extend their incident response capabilities and  services in order to meet the ever-growing challenges  to secure their networks. Currently all Member States  connected to the internet have CSIRT capabilities,  but the level of maturity among them still varies  dramatically. It is ENISA’s mission to continue to help  minimise those differences.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/recommendations-on-european-data-protection-certification https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/certification_survey https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/overview-of-the-practices-of-ict-certification-laboratories-in-europe/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/online-tracking-and-user-protection-mechanisms/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/technical-guidance-on-qualified-trust-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/qwacs-plugin/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eidas-overview-on-the-implementation-and-uptake-of-trust-services/  28  In 2017 ENISA published a study on the maturity  aspects of CSIRTs, tailored to the national teams  expected to join the CSIRTs network. The study takes  all relevant information sources into account, with  a special emphasis on the NIS directive, the various  ENISA reports on CSIRT capabilities, maturity and  metrics, and on the security incident management  maturity model for CSIRTs, which is a good practice  that has been widely used in Europe for several  years. Additionally, ENISA has organised research to  establish a readily implementable and useable self- assessment survey and peer review methodology.  More than five Member States that had already  experienced the CSIRT certification process supported  this research. The primary target audience for the  report is the EU CSIRTs network teams and their  management. However, the report, and especially the  maturity self-assessment that it contains, will be of  use to all CSIRTs all over the world.  As part of a continuous effort, ENISA maintains  and regularly updates its online European CSIRT  Inventory. In 2017, in light of the implementation of  the NIS directive, ENISA concluded a major usability  makeover of the tool, which now has new features  and is more user friendly. The new features of the  tool include very detailed graphics and statistics on  the participation of CSIRTs in different communities,  membership status and contact details. The listing  features 342 teams from 45 countries, a major  increase that shows the continuous expansion of  CSIRTs globally. This tool now allows the reader to  filter the displayed teams by NIS directive CSIRTs  network membership.  1.3.1.2 Output O.3.1.2 — Update and provide  technical training for Member States and  EU bodies  In 2017most of the activities in this area aimed at  maintaining and extending the collection of good- practice guidelines and training courses for CSIRT and  other operational personnel. The agency supported  the development of Member States’ national incident  response preparedness by providing good-practice  guidance on key elements of NIS capacity building,  with a focus on CSIRT training and services in order to  improve the skills of CSIRT teams and their personnel.  Over the past several years ENISA has developed a  wide range of cybersecurity training courses, and  delivered the training content to several national  and governmental CSIRTs and their constituents. In  detail, with the emphasis that the NIS directive places  on the importance of the seven critical sectors, the  agency aimed to identify the current situation in these  sectors with regard to the available cybersecurity  training courses, and whether there are any training  needs specific to each of the sectors, beyond the  generic needs for such training. In this regard, ENISA  produced a set of deliverables providing:  stocktaking results on the current situation for  each of the NIS directive critical sectors with  regard to the available cybersecurity training  courses; and  recommendations on what could be done with  ENISA’s training portfolio in order to improve  the suitability of that portfolio for the existing  training needs.  In 2017 ENISA also delivered, for the first time,  sector-specific training for technical specialists in  the aviation sector. The training media campaign  led to 110 requests for participation from different  organisations in both the private and the public  sector in all Member States. Due to the enormous  amount of applications, priority was given to the  target audience (airports, air carriers and air traffic  control personnel), coverage of Member States and  relevance to the training.  Moreover, regarding good practices for CSIRT services,  ENISA and the CSIRT community jointly set up a task  force with the goal of reaching a consensus on a  reference security incident classification taxonomy.  The task force is composed of representatives of 41  CSIRTs from 16 Member States. Thanks to the task  force’s efforts, ENISA consolidated the results into a  document that was published in January 2018 and  paved the road towards efforts to build a common  language to face future incidents, also in light of the  implementation of the NIS directive.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 29  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  1.3.1.3 Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU Member  States in the development and assessment of  national cybersecurity strategies  In 2017 ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of NCSS by updating  the EU NCSS map. The new version of the map  was created on the basis of the work performed in  previous years and presents the Member States’  strategic objectives and good practices in an easy and  user-friendly manner.  In addition, ENISA, in cooperation with the Dutch  National Cyber Security Centre, organised a workshop  in the Hague. The focus of the workshop was on  collaboration, a topic not only fundamental to the  objectives of a strategy but also highlighted in several  pieces of legislation, such as the NIS directive and  the new cybersecurity act. In this workshop ENISA  validated the results of two reports created to  provide guidelines and support the output of this  activity: one for cooperative models on public–private  partnerships (PPPs) and one for cooperative models  on ISACs. The documents depict the status of ISACs  and PPPs with regard to cybersecurity in Europe  through well-informed maps.  In total, 18 Member States participated in the activities  of ENISA regarding this output. Representatives from  14 Member States attended the workshop.  1.3.2 Objective 3.2. Support EU  institutions’ capacity building  1.3.2.1 Output O.3.2.1 — Restricted and public info  notes on NIS  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events  and developments through info notes. Info notes  are explanatory notes, regarding, for example,  events that reach a certain level of public and media  attention. Relevant NIS events might cover incidents,  significant developments and announcements in the  field of cybersecurity.  ENISA has provided balanced and neutral information  regarding such events, covering issues, points of action,  mitigation measures, summaries, related practices, etc.  In 2017 ENISA fulfilled its intention to continue  providing info notes in a timely manner as a reliable  and continuous service to its stakeholders.  Output O.3.2.2 — Restricted: upon request, support  the assessment of existing policies/procedures/ practices on NIS within EU institutions  In 2017 a report was drafted as a joint effort  between DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology and ENISA, who were tasked  with presenting an overview of relevant sectorial  initiatives at the EU and international levels in the  field of cybersecurity. The information included in the  document was presented to the Cooperation Group  to ensure that both the members of the Cooperation  Group and the relevant actors at Member State level  involved in the transposition process for the NIS  directive have a clear picture of the work that has  already been conducted in the field.  This document builds on the work conducted by  ENISA in 2016, validated by multiple directorates- general, and maps the main stakeholders at EU level,  along with the relevant policy framework in the field  of cybersecurity across key sectors covered by the  NIS directive: energy, transport, banking and finance,  health and drinking water.  The resulting document is conceived as a ‘living’  document, and will be regularly updated by the  Commission services and ENISA to inform the  Cooperation Group about any developments that  might be relevant for the transposition process.  Considering the sensitive nature of the information  that ENISA received from the EU institutions, this  deliverable was restricted in distribution.  1.3.2.2 Output O.3.2.3 — Representation of  ENISA on the Steering Board of CERT-EU and  representation of the EU agencies using CERT-EU  services  In 2017 a new service agreement with CERT-EU  was put in place for ENISA. For the aforementioned  agreement, ENISA has the formal task of representing  the EU’s decentralised agencies.  In this context ENISA participated in the Steering  Board of CERT-EU, representing itself and the EU’s  decentralised agencies to ensure that the needs of  these bodies are adequately represented.  1.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist private-sector  capacity building  1.3.3.1 Output O.3.3.1 — Cybersecurity culture:  from identifying the issues to providing working  scenarios for management level  ENISA has conducted a study that contains guidance  and practical tools for organisations on developing  and maintaining an internal cybersecurity culture.  30  The Cyber security culture in organisations report is  the product of multidisciplinary research undertaken  in order to better understand the dynamics of how  cybersecurity culture can be developed and shaped  within organisations. This research draws from  disciplines that include organisational sciences,  psychology, law and cybersecurity, along with the  knowledge and experiences gathered from some  of Europe’s largest organisations. The report itself  contains good practices, methodological tools and  step-by-step guidance for those seeking to commence  or enhance their organisation’s own cybersecurity  culture programme.  1.3.3.2 Output O.3.3.2 — Recommendations  on cyber insurance  ENISA conducted a study to assess the level of  harmonisation of the risk assessment language  in cyber insurance. The lack of harmonisation/ standardisation was found to have a significant  negative impact on the broad adoption of cyber- insurance products and several recommendations  were developed to support the cyber-insurance  market in achieving a higher level of language  commonality. The report was based on input  provided by stakeholders covering the full supply  spectrum of the cyber-insurance market, focusing on  carriers, underwriters and brokers. In all, 51 insurance  carriers, underwriters, brokers and reinsurers  and 58 companies in total from 12 Member States  participated in drafting the recommendations via  interviews and an online survey.  A very successful workshop was held in Brussels,  with over 90 registrations for participation from  multiple stakeholders from the fields of industry,  academia and policy. In all, 24 insurance companies  and 41 companies in total from 14 Member States  participated in the workshop on validating the  recommendations. The workshop contributed to  the discussions on the maturity and standardisation  of the cyber-insurance market. The report has  been widely referenced in the community. Its  recommendations were very well received and are  being carefully considered by key stakeholders,  including the OECD, which cites the report in a  relevant publication on the current state of the  cyber-insurance market 11. Some have in fact already  been adopted by associations proposing non-binding  wording models to promote harmonisation in the  market, such as the German Insurance Association.  11 http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/insurance/2018-oecd- conference-cyber-insurance-market.htm  1.3.4 Objective 3.4. Assist in improving  general awareness  1.3.4.1 Output O.3.4.1 — Cyber security challenges  In 2017 ENISA maintained its involvement in the area  of cybersecurity challenges and advised the Member  States on running national Cyber Security Challenge  competitions. The agency has also continued its own  annual European Cyber Security Challenge.  ENISA’s support for national and European activities  targeted university students from technical schools  and young talent, including security practitioners  from the industry. The goals in 2017 were to increase  interest and future opportunities in NIS for these  communities by promoting excellence in the form of  competitions and to gather feedback on the areas of  interest from these stakeholders.  The success of ENISA’s Cyber Security Challenge is  evidenced by the participation in the event, held in  Malaga, Spain, of more than 150 contestants from  15 different EU and European Free Trade Association  (EFTA) countries.  1.3.4.2 Output O.3.4.2 — European Cyber Security  Month deployment  European Cyber Security Month has continued to  outperform original expectations, as evidenced by  the increased number of participants and activities,  and the increased engagement year on year. In 2017  ENISA focused on providing guidance to Member  States’ campaigns and techniques to better evaluate  the impact of awareness raising.  1.3.5 Objective 3.5. Response to Article  14 requests under capacity activity  1.3.5.1 Output O.3.5.1 — Response to requests  under capacity activity  During 2017 ENISA delivered training to the European  Parliament, the European Aviation Safety Agency,  Latvia, Romania and Sweden on topics such mobile  malware, artefact analysis, and incident handling and  response.

Cyber crisis  cooperation  1.4.1.1 Output O.4.1.1 — Evaluation of Cyber  Europe 2016 and report on exercise after-action  activities from 2014 to 2016  In 2016 ENISA organised the fourth pan-European  cyber-crisis exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016).  The pan-European exercises organised by ENISA are  producing a number of significant recommendations  and actions for all of the involved stakeholders. It  is extremely important to ensure follow-up and to  monitor the progress of all these actions. Otherwise,  the added value from the lessons learned from the  exercise is diminished.  In early 2017 ENISA performed an in-depth analysis  of the evaluation data gathered from the exercise.  This resulted in a detailed after-action report that was  published together with a related video on ENISA’s  website 14 in summer 2017.  First, the exercise fostered cooperation between  targets of simulated cybersecurity incidents, security  providers and national authorities, shedding light  on national-level public–private and private–private  cooperation. Second, CE2016 helped participants  understand how cybersecurity authorities would  cooperate with each other and EU bodies in the  event of a large-scale crisis. Undoubtedly, crisis  cooperation at the EU level is maturing and  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber- europe-programme/ce-2016  improving greatly. Last, the exercise offered countless  opportunities for participants to enhance their  cybersecurity capabilities, from their technical and  operational expertise to their capacity to handle  crisis communication. Organisational and individual  cybersecurity preparedness and capabilities in the EU  were excellent overall.  1.4.1.2 Output O.4.1.2 —  Planning of Cyber Europe 2018  In 2018 ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European  cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2018 (CE2018). This  exercise will closely follow up and build upon the  lessons learned and actions from previous exercises,  such as CE2014 and CE2016.  CE2018 will focus on testing and training on large- scale incident management cooperation procedures  at the EU and national levels. It will offer preparatory  The exercise offered  countless opportunities  for participants  to enhance their  cybersecurity  capabilities, from their  technical and operational  expertise to their  capacity to handle crisis  communication.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme/ce-2016 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme/ce-2016  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 35  training and cooperation opportunities, such as small  exercises, to Member States and the EU institutions  (e.g. Cyber SOPEx). The exercise’s escalation and  build-up will be realistic and focused in order to  better capture how incidents are managed and how  cooperation happens in real life. The exercise will  include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs network set  up under the NIS directive.  In 2017 the agency, together with the cybersecurity  authorities (planners) from the Member States,  developed a comprehensive exercise plan for CE2018.  A dedicated task force has developed an extensive  scenario with over 10 different types of cybersecurity  incidents relevant to the essential sector of aviation,  affecting airports, air carriers, civil aviation authorities  and internet service providers who provide services  to the aviation industry.  The exercise will be held in summer 2018. A trailer for  this exercise was produced in 2017 and published 15  early in 2018.  1.4.1.3 Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for cyber  exercise planning and cyber crisis management  Cyber Exercise Platform development and content  management  In 2014 ENISA started to develop the Cyber Exercise  Platform (CEP). CEP hosts a number of services  that ENISA offers to the Member States and EU  institutions, such as exercise organisation and  management, an exercise playground with technical  incidents, a map of exercises and hosting the  15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCDOp7_hsjY  exercise-development community. In 2017 ENISA  maintained and enhanced the experience offered by  CEP, including user support. It added support for the  Virtual Exercise Universe, a set of online applications  emulating real-life platforms such as social media,  mainstream media, expert blogs, dedicated/ specialised sites, the online presence of hackers, etc.  Also in 2017 ENISA developed a Cyber Incident  Visualisation tool, which includes a map that  visualises the occurrence of incidents. During the  year ENISA also developed an online training and  education platform to support exercise preparation  and other related activities of the agency.  In addition, new content and exercise incident  challenges and material were developed in order  to maintain the interest of stakeholders and make  CEP a central tool in cybersecurity exercising for  all stakeholders, in the form of ad hoc on-demand  exercises (Cybersecurity Technical Exercises — CTEx).  The CTEx database of incidents includes over 40  incidents ranging from malware analysis, network  forensics, mobile malware, steganography, offensive  and defensive capture-the-flag games, etc.  If you are interested in organising such an exercise  contact: c3@enisa.europa.eu  EU-level cyber-crisis and incident management  procedures and Connecting Europe facility  cybersecurity digital service infrastructure  During 2017 ENISA started activities for the future  takeover of the management and operations for the  centralised components of the MeliCERTes platform,  formerly known as CEF CSP Cybersecurity DSI Core  Service Platform.

As the body with final responsibility for MeliCERTes,  and the body in charge of maintaining it, ENISA is  currently following the development of the platform  closely, and is actively supporting the Commission  and the consortium of national CSIRTs in the various  activities that are being carried out. At the same time the  agency is building its capability to gradually take over the  parts of the infrastructure as implemented.  ENISA is expected to implement some of the systems  and functionalities for the management, maintenance  and further development of the MeliCERTes platform,  together with the development of some of the related  internal and external operational process.  Blueprint  In 2017 ENISA supported DG Communications  Networks, Content and Technology in its activities  related to cyber-crisis management and in  preparation for the release of the blueprint  proposal 16 in parallel to the cybersecurity act.  16  Commission Recommendation on 'Coordinated Response  to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises' consists of  a Blueprint for Coordinated response to large-scale  cross- border  cybersecurity incidents and crises http://ec.europa.eu/ transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2017/EN/C-2017-6100-F1-EN-ANNEX- 1-PART-1.PDF so that the EU has in place a well-rehearsed plan in  case of a large scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis.  ENISA experts drafted papers, supported CSIRTs  network working groups and represented the  agency in crisis-management workshops in  Brussels. Additionally, the specifications of a  prototype aimed at supporting the production of  EU cybersecurity technical situation reports, as  defined in the blueprint proposal, were drafted with  the assistance of an external expert in machine  learning and natural-language processing. The  specifications of this prototype were used as the  foundations for a public tender worth EUR 80 000  released in January 2018.  1.4.2 Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building  1.4.2.1 Output O.4.2.1 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and  law enforcement agencies  In 2017 the key goal for ENISA, of supporting the  collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement  communities, was served by analysing the technical,  legal and organisational aspects of this collaboration.  In addition to the publication of two reports in  this area, the annual workshop for national and  governmental CSIRT and their law enforcement  counterparts was organised together with Europol’s  European Cybercrime Centre and inter alia it  demonstrated that full-circle policy should mean  involving judiciary authorities.  CSIRT's Network meeting - October 2017  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 37  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  1.4.2.2 Output O.4.2.2 — EU CSIRT network  secretariat and support for EU CSIRT network  community building  In 2017 ENISA supported the Commission and  Member States in the implementation of the  NIS directive, in particular in the area of incident  response. As part of this activity ENISA has  an active role as CSIRTs network secretariat  and actively supports cooperation among the  CSIRTs. Moreover, ENISA provides expertise and  assistance, as envisioned by the NIS directive,  by developing guidance and good practices in  the area of operational community efforts, such  as on information exchange or CSIRTs maturity  assessments.  As defined by the NIS directive in its role as CSIRTs  network secretariat, ENISA has engaged all 28 EU  Member States and their designated CSIRTs in  developing rules and procedures. The CSIRTs network  secretariat has engaged them in the implementation  of the NIS directive through dedicated physical  meetings (in Malta, Estonia and Greece) and working  group activities, and, last but not least, by supporting  operational cooperation during cyber crises such as  WannaCry and NotPetya.  Furthermore, the agency contributed to the dialogue  between NIS-related communities, including between  CSIRTs and law enforcement and data-privacy  communities, in order to support a consistent EU- wide approach to NIS.  Through the CSIRTs network working groups, more  than 10 Member States CSIRT representatives actively  participated in activities that improved operational  cooperation and information sharing among CSIRTs  in Europe.  In addition, ENISA took an active role in supporting  the CSIRTs network in activities relevant to the  CEF work programme. ENISA also successfully  developed and managed the main communications  infrastructure of the CSIRTs network that was  assigned to the agency.  1.4.3 Objective 4.3. Response to Article  14 requests under community activity  1.4.3.1 Output O.4.3.1 — Response to requests  under community-building activity  The outcomes of the Article 14 requests under policy  activity for 2017 are as follows.  Following the Article 14 request by another EU  agency, the European Agency for the Operational  Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the  Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, ENISA  supported the organisation, planning, conduct and  evaluation of the exercise on the visa information  system (VIS). In particular, ENISA trained that  agency’s personnel and exercise planners from  the Member States on the exercise management  methodology. In addition ENISA helped them  to apply the methodology in the organisation  of the VIS exercise by providing templates for  all required documentation, supporting the  development of the different products of the  exercise and supporting the conduct and the  evaluation process. ENISA also offered a dedicated  space within the CEP for the VIS exercise and  offered customer helpdesk support.  Following a request from the Science and  Technology Options Assessment of the European  Parliament, ENISA conducted a study with the title  Cyber-security in the EU CSDP — Challenges and risks  for the EU. For this study, ENISA consulted external  stakeholders within and beyond the EU (i.e. NATO,  academia). The study concluded with a set of  proposals from the political down to the tactical  level. The study was subsequently presented in  the European Parliament.  Following a request from the Estonian Presidency,  ENISA assisted the organisers of EU Cybrid 17 17,  the event organised by Estonian Presidency, in  developing the exercise scenario. This exercise  was the first of its kind at the level of ministers of  defence. ENISA also supported and participated in  the exercise during the execution.  Following a request from the European External  Action Service, ENISA provided assistance in  developing the 2017 EU parallel and coordinated  exercise by extending the EU Cybrid17 scenario to  accommodate the needs of the exercise in 2017.  17 https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/EUCYBRID2017  https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/EUCYBRID2017  38  1.4.4 General results: achievement of performance indicators for Activity 4  Summary of outputs in Activity 4 — Community: foster the emerging European  network and information security community Outputs Performance indicator  Objective 4.1.

Management.  Engagement with stakeholders.  International activities.  Compliance and support.  1.5.1 Objective 5.1. Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall  management of the agency. The Executive Director  has one personal assistant.  To support the Executive Director an Executive  Director’s Office (EDO) has been set up. The tasks  covered by EDO include policy advice, legal advice,  Management Board secretariat, coordination of the  work programme and press communications.  During 2017, policy and legal advice extended to all  aspects of the agency’s work and included advice in  relation to both the operational and administrative  departments of the agency.  In 2017 EDO continued to support the Management  Board and the Executive Board in their functions by  providing secretariat assistance.  In relation to the Management Board, one ordinary  meeting was organised during 2017 and informal  meetings were held as necessary. The Management  Board portal was supported as well. Three meetings  of the Executive Board were held.  1.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement  with stakeholders  Under this objective are grouped some of the  tasks and activities of the agencies carried out in  collaboration with stakeholders.  National Liaison Officers Network.  Permanent Stakeholders Group.  Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities.  Outreach and image building activities.  National Liaison Officers Network  ENISA has kicked off various activities aiming at  strengthening the cooperation with its National  Liaison Officers (NLO) Network. NLOs are key  actors in the agency’s daily work. They are the  liaison between ENISA and the community of  network and information security (NIS) experts and  relevant organisations in their respective Member  State acting as 'ambassadors' and ‘facilitators’ of  ENISA’s work.  In 2017 ENISA built upon these efforts and improved  its cooperation with the NLO Network as the first  point of contact for ENISA in the Member States.  A meeting of NLOs took place in April 2017 to  strengthen ENISA’s cooperation with the NLO  Network. Particular emphasis was placed on how to  improve collaboration, in view of the enhanced role  for NLOs discussed at Management Board level.  The agency maintained, and shared with the NLO  Network, information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities (e.g. unit responsible for the project,  relevant tender results, etc.), while maintaining  available online resources and expanding them  as appropriate.  Information was sent to the members of the NLO  Network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, events  organised or contributed to by ENISA, etc.  In 2017 the Management Board adopted guidelines  on the missions, principles and functioning of the  NLO Network, thus strengthening its role.  Permanent Stakeholders Group  In 2017 ENISA reinforced the contribution of the  Permanent Stakeholders Group to the ENISA work  programme. The current Permanent Stakeholders  ENISA has kicked off  various activities aiming  at strengthening the  cooperation with its  National Liaison Officers  (NLO) Network. NLOs are  key actors in the agency’s  daily work.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 41  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  Group consists of 33 top IT-security experts, who  were appointed following an open call for expression  of interest for membership in 2017.  The current group is composed of nominated  members from two organisations (Europol and Office  of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic  Communications) and one advisory body (the  Article 29 Working Party), and members appointed ad  personam, amounting to 33 members from all over  the European Union, compared with 23 members in  the previous group.  These members constitute a multidisciplinary group  derived from industry, academia and consumer  organisations, and are selected upon the basis of their  own specific expertise and personal merits. Three  nominated members represent NRAs, data protection  authorities and law enforcement authorities.  The Permanent Stakeholders Group was  established by the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013). The Management Board, acting  on a proposal by the Executive Director, sets up a  Permanent Stakeholders Group for a term of office of  2.5 years.  The role of the Permanent Stakeholders Group is to  advise the Executive Director on the development  of the agency’s work programme and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders on all  related issues.  Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities  In 2017 ENISA sought improve its focus on key  activities and engage the highest possible number  of stakeholders. This includes the institutional  stakeholders (e.g. EU Institutions) and other various  groups of such as academia, industry, citizens, etc.  The agency will continue to develop various  communication tools and channels, including the  website, with a strong emphasis on social media.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the  Stakeholder Communication team, which will seek the  appropriate level of outreach activities to take ENISA’s  work to all interested parties and to provide added  value to the European Union.  Outreach and image-building activities  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for  all stakeholders. It is essential that EU citizens can  trust ENISA’s work.  Cybersecurity threats are increasing all over the  world, and Europe is no exception. With this in  mind, ENISA’s image needs to be continuously  strengthened.  The dissemination of the agency work is essential in  creating an NIS culture across the various actors in  Europe. ENISA is aware of this fact, and will aim to  reach all stakeholders who require information about  the work developed by the agency.  Several activities are planned in different Member  States that will strengthen cybersecurity awareness  across Europe, fulfilling ENISA’s mandate, mission and  strategy.  1.5.3 Objective 5.3. International  relations  In 2017 the Management Board adopted guidelines  on international relations.  1.5.4 Objective 5.4. Compliance  and support  The Stakeholder Relations and Administration  Department (SRAD) strives to operate a cost-efficient,  customer-oriented service.  SRAD has contributed to ENISA’s strategy both  internally and externally, seeking optimal solutions  for delivering on ENISA’s mandate.  SRAD seeks to enhance the functionality of the  agency’s administrative procedures, to provide  administration-related services and strategic support  and orientation for the agency’s strategy.  SRAD oversees a variety of programmes, projects and  services relating to personnel, finance, purchasing,  technology, facilities management, health, safety,  security and much more.  SRAD’s aim is to provide high quality services to the  whole organisation and external stakeholders to  ensure the optimal use of the agency's resources  to increase its overall efficiency. Coordination with  the IAS, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the ECA,  the European Ombudsman, etc. is one of the main  tasks in this area. All internal policies related to  transparency, the anti-fraud policy, protection of  whistle-blowers, declarations of interests, etc. are  addressed under this activity.  42  1.5.4.1  Information technology  IT at ENISA must support the organisation’s business  processes and provide the platforms and the tools  needed by the Core Operations Department for the  secure hosting and operation of its IT systems. The  focus is on building formal procedures and processes,  and outsourcing first-level IT support. Moreover,  additional information security tools will be put  in place, such as DMARC (Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) for the  agency’s email and an intrusion-detection system in  cooperation with CERT-EU.  1.5.4.2 Finance, accounting and procurement  The key objective here is to ensure the compliance of  financial resource management with the applicable  rules, and in particular with sound financial  management (i.e. the effectiveness, efficiency and  economy principles), as set down in the financial  regulation. As the agency’s resources are derived from  the EU budget, management is required to comply  with a set of regulations, rules and standards set  down by the EU’s competent institutions. The Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Unit is responsible  for high-quality reporting (annual accounts) and  contribution to the audit and discharge procedures.  In 2017 preparations were made so that in 2018 the  agency will benefit from the deployment of tools  used to simplify and automate its work, automated  applications (budget reporting, procurement  planning), e-Prior (EU Commission platform for the  management of the procurement lifecycle, from pre- award to post-award of a contract).  The deployment of tools, coupled with the  outsourcing of certain low-value activities, improved  the overall resource-management and reporting  capacity of the agency.  The aim is to contribute to the agency’s annual  and multiannual programming, from inception to  execution. Financial resources are allocated according  to the needs expressed by the organisational units  and according to the priorities set by the agency’s  management.  Key objectives for the year 2017 included high  budget-commitment and payment rates, a low  number of budget transfers during the year, planned  and justified carry-overs and reduced average  payment delay.

The  agency also managed 11 recruitment procedures.  ENISA furthermore adopted a new approach  in terms of learning and development, moving  towards a learning organisation with a number  of activities including new learning opportunities,  managerial workshops and an enhanced process  to identify strategic learning needs. Various other  measures were developed that contributed to a  continuous organisational effort to build a high- performance culture (e.g. a new internal mobility  policy). In addition, the agency offered several  traineeship opportunities enabling young graduates  to acquire practical experience and knowledge of EU  administration and of the agency’s day-to-day work.  1.5.4.4 Internal communication, legal affairs, data  protection and information security coordination  1.5.4.4.1 Internal communication  Internal communication activities aim to keep all those  working within the agency informed and to enable both  management and staff to fulfil their responsibilities  effectively and efficiently. Staff members must be  regularly informed of policy decisions taken by the  Management Board and ENISA’s senior management,  enabling them to better understand their role and to  acquire a broader knowledge of the agency’s mission  and activities. This should contribute to a common  corporate culture, improve staff engagement and  ultimately also improve the implementation of the  work programme. Moreover, it is expected that a new  internal communications strategy will be completed  and implemented in 2018. Thereafter, it is envisaged  that an annual review of this strategy will be carried out  to ensure that it is kept up to date and appropriate for  the agency.  44  1.5.4.4.2 Legal affairs  In 2017 EDO supported the legal aspects associated  with the operations of the agency. These include  dealing with matters such as contracts, procurement,  employment related matters, data protection and  corporate governance matters. The Legal Affairs service  also managed complaints submitted pursuant to  Article 90 of the Staff Regulations and complaints to the  European Ombudsman, and represented the agency  before the Court of Justice of the European Union.  1.5.4.4.3 Data protection compliance tasks and  data protection officer  The main tasks of the data protection officer are  as follows.  Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations  pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and  document this activity and the responses received.  Monitor the implementation and application of  ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data.  Monitor the implementation and application of  Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 at ENISA, including  the requirements for data security, the provision  of information to data subjects and their requests  in relation to exercising their rights under the  regulation, along with the requirements for prior  checking or prior consultation with the European  Data Protection Supervisor.  Monitor the documentation, notification and  communication of personal data in the context of  ENISA’s operations.  Act as ENISA’s contact point for the European Data  Protection Supervisor on issues related to the  processing of personal data.  Inform and advise ENISA on the current status of  the revision of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and  relevant discussions at EU level.  Support ENISA in preparing for the transition to  the new data protection regulation (action plan).  1.5.4.4.4 Information security coordination  The information security officer (ISO) coordinates  the information security management system on  behalf of the authorising officer. In particular, the ISO  advises the ICT Unit in developing and implementing  information security policies, standards, guidelines  and baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality,  integrity and authentication of the agency’s  information systems. The ISO is instrumental in  incident handling and incident response, and in  security-event monitoring. The ISO also leads the  security training for the agency’s staff and provides  security guidance on all IT projects, including the  evaluation and recommendation of technical controls.  In 2017 the ISO contributed to such goals as:  improving ENISA’s security posture by planning  penetration tests and vulnerability assessments;  advising on security policies and updating existing  ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks;  improving internal security training for ENISA staff;  implementing new systems and tools that can  support improvements in IT security.  Throughout 2017 several penetration tests of ENISA  main portals and platforms took place, together  with a comprehensive security-posture assessment.  Key priorities in terms of information security  were identified for the medium/long term. During  the corporate staff meeting the ISO delivered  regular security-awareness-raising presentations.  An important tool (Microsoft Advanced Threat  Analytics) for detecting malicious activities was  deployed internally.  1.6 FOLLOW-UP ON THE RESULT AND  IMPACT OF ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT  BEFORE 2017  This section aims to summarise the result and impact  of activities (work packages) carried out during the  previous year, with indicators set to be evaluated in  current and later years.

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 49  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  5050  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 51  2.1 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  2.1.1 Budget execution of EU subsidy (C1  funds)  The excellent budget execution can be translated into  the following figures: the expenditure appropriations for  ENISA’s 2017 budget of EUR 10 608 964 were committed  at a rate of 99.99 % as at 31 December 2017.  ENISA did not cancel any C1 appropriations of the  year (cancellation rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven capacity of the agency to use the entrusted  funds efficiently in order to implement its annual  work programme and to manage its operational and  administrative expenditure.  The respective payment rate on expenditure  appropriations was 88.19 % in 2017. This payment  rate is high and demonstrates that the agency’s  capacity to finalise its annual activities and to execute  the relevant payments within the year of reference  was maintained. The procurement planning, which  was moved forward to the end of the preceding year  (2016) and enabled the agency to launch projects  related to the work programme in early 2017,  contributed significantly to the improvement of the  payment rate of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.2 Amending budgets/budgetary  transfers  The following table summarises the impact of  budgetary transfers Nos 1 to 6 (approved by the  Executive Director of ENISA) on the initial 2017 budget.  2.  PART II MANAGEMENT  Initial budget 2017 budget transfers 1 -6 approved  by the Executive Director Appropriations after transfer 1-6  Title 1 6 387 979.00 0.00 6 387 979.00  Title 2 1 770 700.00 – 45 070.00 1 725 630.00  Title 3 3 086 000.00 45 070.00 3 131 070.00  Total 11 244 679.00 0.00 11 244 679.00  Table — Summary of budgetary transfers 1 to 6 impact on budget  5252  Appropriations after  transfer 1-6 Amending budget 1/2017 New appropriations 2017  (amending budget 1/2017)  Title 1 6 387 979.00 14 638.30 6 402 617.30  Title 2 1 725 630.00 – 132 500.01 1 593 129.99  Title 3 3 131 070.00 48 408.20 3 179 478.20  Total 11 244 679.00 – 69 453.51 11 175 225.49  New appropriations  2017 (amending  budget 1/2017)  2017 budget transfers 7-10 approved  by the Executive Director Final budget execution 2017  Title 1 6 402 617.30 – 4 188.09 6 398 429.21  Title 2 1 593 129.99 7 182.47 1 600 312.46  Title 3 3 179 478.20 – 2 994.38 3 176 483.82  Total 11 175 225.49 0.00 11 175 225.49  Title Total C1  appropriations carried  forward to 2018  Subsidy from Greek  authorities carried forward  (R0 2017 to R0 2018)  Total amount  carried forward from  2017 to 2018  Title 1 — Staff 482 509,75 0,00 482 509,75  Title 2 — Administration 430 128,27 26 370,24 456 498,51  Title 3 — Operations 498 802,49 0,00 287 569,77  Total 1 411 440,51 26 370,24 1 437 810,75  Table — Summary of amending budget 1/2017 impact on budget  Table — Summary of the budgetary transfers 7 to 10 impact on budget  Table — Summary of carry forwards 2017 to 2018  The following table summarises the subsequent impact of the amending budget 1/2017  (approved by the Management Board).  The table below summarises the impact of budget transfers Nos 7 to 10 (approved by the Executive  Director after the adoption of amending budget 1/2017) on the final budget execution.  5.2.1 Carry forward of commitment  appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not  consumed by payments at the end of 2017 were  carried forward (automatic carry forward) to 2018 (C8  appropriations).  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the subsidy from the Greek authorities for the lease  of the ENISA premises in Greece (external assigned  revenue — R0 appropriations) that were not paid by  31 December 2017 were carried forward (automatic  carry forward to R0 appropriations 2018).  The funds carried forward to 2018 (C8 appropriations)  are detailed below:  The total of cancelled appropriations carried forward from 2016 to 2017 (C8 appropriations of 2017)  but finally not paid in 2017 was EUR 90 916.34.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 53  PART II. Management  2.1.3 Types of procurement procedures  In 2017 a total of 40 procurement procedures were  launched, resulting in 38 contracts being signed  (nine framework contracts, 13 service contracts, one  works contract and 15 specific contracts awarded  under re-opening of competition). Also, 340 purchase  orders (175 of which were issued under pre-existing  framework contracts) were signed.  2.1.4 Interest charged by suppliers  During 2017 the agency had to pay EUR 2 393.93 of  interest to its suppliers as result of exceeding the  payment terms agreed with the suppliers.  2.2 MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN  RESOURCES  2.2.1 Human resources  At the end of 2017, 74 statutory staff were employed  by the agency (42 temporary agents, 29 contract  agents and three seconded national experts). Despite  the great efforts made in the selection procedures  the agency’s attraction and retention capability is still  suffering from a low country-coefficient factor and  the fact that contract-agent posts are not financially  competitive in the cybersecurity job market.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members  in Athens, where no European Schools are based,  several service-level agreements have been  concluded with each of the private schools being  used by the children of staff members. Several  children of staff members at ENISA Heraklion  attended the European School in Heraklion in 2017,  which offers education at the following levels:  nursery, primary and secondary education. ENISA  has a service-level agreement with the Commission’s  DG Human Resources and Security for the provision  of these services.  The organisational chart, establishment plan and  statistics for ENISA staff are included in Annex A.1.  2.2.2 Results of screening  Following the European Commission’s methodology,  the agency performed the ‘job screening’  benchmarking exercise for 2017. The result of  the exercise, which is a snapshot of the staffing  situation as at the end of December 2017, appears  in Annex A.4. It is relevant to mention that the  ‘Overhead’, support functions, represents only  19.28 % of the total statutory staff count, which is  below the 25 % maximum value accepted for the  agencies. This is only possible due to very efficient  resource management.  2.3 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2.3.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multiannual  character of programmes, as well as the nature of  the payments concerned. In order to achieve the best  control possible the agency has focused intensively  on the verification of results before transactions are  initiated (ex ante verification).  In line with ICS 8 (Processes and procedures), the  agency has produced the ex post control report for  the financial year 2016. The recommendations issued  in the report were addressed during the year.  The ex post controls of the financial year 2016 were  quite extensive. A total of 234 financial transactions  were sampled and checked, representing 11.62 %  of all of the agency’s financial transactions and  representing 65.15 % of the agency’s 2016 budget. As  a result, one recommendation was issued regarding  a delay of payment that did not generate any interest  to be paid.  Moreover, the ECA is in charge of the annual audit of  the agency, which concludes with the publication of  an annual report in accordance with the provisions  of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union. For several consecutive years  the ECA’s reports have confirmed the improvement in  the agency’s overall internal control environment and  performance.  2.4 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION TASKS  ENTRUSTED TO OTHER SERVICES AND  ENTITIES  The agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  5454  2.5 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT RESULTS  AND FOLLOW-UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS  2.5.1 Internal Audit Service  The agency had no open recommendations from the  IAS in 2017. In September 2016 the IAS performed the  agency’s risk assessment. The report showed the next  three topics for auditing: stakeholders’ involvement in  the deliverables, human resources and IT. The agency will  take immediate action to construct a quality management  system and implement its risk-management policy. The  audit on stakeholders’ involvement in the deliverables  was performed during the last week of September 2017.  The draft report will be communicated to the agency in  the second quarter of 2018.  2.5.2 European Court of Auditors  Issued in 2017, the 2016 ECA report on the annual  accounts does not contain any recommendations.  2.5.3 Follow-up of audit plans, audits  and recommendations  The agency will continue to improve its internal systems  and remain vigilant with regard to the possible risks  of the activity within the internal legal and financial  framework to strive for the current situation of non- compliance issues attested by the IAS and the ECA.  2.6 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS  FROM THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  2.6.1 2015 discharge  Regarding the European Parliament decision  of 27 April 2017, the Executive Director of the  agency was granted discharge in respect of the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the  financial year 2015. The closure of the accounts of the  agency for the financial year 2015 was also approved 23.  2.6.2 Measures implemented in  response to the observations of the  discharge authority  The following table presents a summary of the  main observations and comments by the discharge  authority on the implementation of the 2015 budget  and the measures taken by ENISA.  23 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-// EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2017-0175+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN  Main observations by the  discharge authority  ENISA’s replies and measures  Inclusion of a standard chapter on  transparency, accountability and  integrity in 2016 annual report.  As from the 2017 annual activity report a standard chapter on transparency,  accountability and integrity is included (see next section).  Considerable delay in the payment  of rent for the offices in Athens by  the Greek authorities.  The agency made continued significant efforts in liaising with the Greek  authorities in order to remedy the situation. However, ENISA is dependent on  the good will of the Greek authorities.  Difficulty to recruit, attract and  retain suitably qualified staff.  The agency has implemented social measures (e.g. food vouchers, increased  education allowances) to attract and retain qualified staff.  Adoption of internal rules on  whistleblowing during the first  quarter of 2017.  Internal rules on whistleblowing have been drafted and are under discussion  for formal validation by upper management.  Absence of publication on the  website of the CVs and declarations  of interests of the agency’s  Management Board members and  of its Executive Board.  Declarations of interest and of commitment of ENISA Management Board  representatives can be found here: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/ management-board/mb2017 Only the CV of the Chair of the Management Board is currently available on  ENISA’s website: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/ management-board/jean-baptiste-demaison-cv  Transparency to improve in  contacts with lobbyists and  stakeholders.  In accordance with its legal basis ENISA has to maintain regular dialogue with  the private sector, consumer organisations and academic experts. Internal  rules have been adopted to define and clarify the relationship between ENISA  and its stakeholders to guarantee transparency.  Furthermore, the members of the Management Board are only required  to provide annual declarations of interest and annual declarations of  commitments. These declarations have been published on ENISA’s website.  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2017-0175+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2017-0175+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2017 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2017 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/jean-baptiste-demaison-cv https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/jean-baptiste-demaison-cv  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 55  PART II. Management  2.7 COMPLIANCE REGARDING  TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY  AND INTEGRITY  The agency is committed to operating as an open and  transparent organisation. To help citizens and other  stakeholders understand how the agency is managed  and held accountable, ENISA publishes a wide range  of documents and other relevant information on its  website (https://www.enisa.europa.eu).  In accordance with the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013), the Management Board is the  highest governing body of the agency. It is composed  of representatives of the Member States and the  Commission. Its main role is to ensure that the  agency carries out its tasks in accordance with its  operational and strategic objectives, as adopted  by the agency’s annual and multiannual work  programme. It also supervises all budgetary and  administrative matters.  To ensure transparency on the decisions adopted,  the internal rules of procedures for the Management  Board, the list of its representatives and alternates  and the minutes of the meetings and adopted  decisions (including annual and multiannual work  programmes) are published on ENISA’s website.  The Management Board has also the responsibility  to appoint the Executive Director, who is responsible  for implementing the decisions adopted by  the Management Board and for the day-to-day  administration of the agency.  To ensure the transparency and accountability of  the executive function, the Executive Director has  the duty, among others, to provide an annual activity  report addressed to the Management Board in order  to assess ENISA’s activities. The Management Board  then, in turn, has to analyse and to assess this report.  Once approved, and no later than 30 June of the year  following the year under review, the annual activity  report, which outlines the achievements for the year  and the resources used, is formally adopted and  communicated to the relevant stakeholders (namely  the European Council, the European Parliament, the  European Commission and the ECA). Once approved  it is made publicly available through ENISA’s website.  For further financial transparency, the annual  accounts (including the budgetary execution report)  and the annual adopted budget are also disclosed on  the website.  The Executive Director, representing the agency,  is accountable to the European Parliament for the  execution of the annual budget. The Executive  Director must provide to the European Parliament  all the information necessary for the discharge  procedure. The discharge procedure is the tool for  the Members of the European Parliament to check  how and to what end public funds have been spent.  The European Parliament can then decide to grant,  postpone or refuse a discharge for a specific year.  To help the European Parliament in the discharge  procedure, independent reviews of the agency take  place. On an annual basis, the ECA gives assurance  on the reliability of the annual financial statements  and on the legality and regularity of the transactions  conducted by the agency for the year under review.  The IAS conducts periodic audits on specific topics,  which are selected based on a risk assessment.  The results and follow-ups of these audits must be  included in the annual activity report (see previous  sections). Complementing the external and internal  audits, independent evaluations are carried out to  assess the performance and the long-term impact of  the agency’s operations.  To avoid situations that might impair its  independence or impartiality, the agency has  implemented a comprehensive set of rules on  preventing and managing conflicts of interest.  Accordingly, ENISA’s Management Board, Permanent  Stakeholder’s Group, Executive Director and officials  seconded by Member States on a temporary basis  need to make a declaration of commitments and a  declaration of any interests that might be considered  to be prejudicial to their independence. These  declarations are made in writing.  ENISA has adopted an anti-fraud strategy and  action plan. It achieved a significant result in terms  of awareness raising by preparing and delivering  internal training on fraud prevention to its entire  staff. Periodic training is planned to ensure that staff  are continuously aware about fraud prevention.  As of 2018 fraud-awareness training is included  in the yearly ethics and integrity training, which is  compulsory for all staff.  In addition to the Staff Regulations the agency has  introduced a code of conduct for all staff that offers  comprehensive information and advice on a variety of  issues, ranging from ethics to compliance with legal  obligations. The aim is to ensure that all employees  share the values of ENISA as an open, accessible and  transparent organisation. Furthermore, in accordance  with the code of good administrative behaviour  issued by the European Ombudsman, ENISA is  implementing a 2-week deadline to answer requests  from citizens.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  56  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 57  3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT  The agency was previously using the risk assessment  done by the IAS in 2012. In September 2016 the IAS  produced a new risk assessment with an audit plan  that started in 2017.  3.2 COMPLIANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF  INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS  ENISA has adopted a set of ICS, based on  international good practice, that aim to ensure the  achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The agency has also put in place an organisational  structure and internal control systems suited to  the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which  it operates.  In 2010 the Management Board of the agency  adopted a set of 16 ICS laying down the minimum  requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2014 the agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise and on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies  (ECA and IAS). During 2017 the agency achieved  compliance with the ICS listed below.  Mission (ICS 1)  The agency’s mission and scope is described in  the ENISA regulation. Mission statements for  departments and units were established based on the  evolution of the organisation in 2017. The roles and  tasks of each department and unit are clearly defined.  Ethical and organisational values (ICS 2)  The agency has procedures in place — including  updates and yearly reminders — to ensure that all  staff are aware of relevant ethical and organisational  values (e.g. ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of  interest, fraud prevention, reporting of irregularities).  Specific training is organised by the agency for its  staff every year in order to reinforce professional  behaviour, compliance with the expected behaviour,  ethics and integrity, and in order to prevent  workplace harassment.  Staff allocation and mobility (ICS 3)  In 2017 ENISA implemented some structural  organisational adjustments with the objective of  3.  PART III ASSESSMENT OF THE  EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  58  increasing the agility of the organisation in adapting  swiftly to new and diverse challenges. Additionally,  two staff moved voluntary from Crete to Athens.  Staff evaluation and development (ICS 4)  In 2017 the performance-management exercise  (annual appraisal and reclassification) took place  successfully, with only one appeal on the annual  appraisal, well below the rate of appeals in other EU  organisations. Both exercises were conducted in line  with the Staff Regulations and related implementing  rules. Comprehensive and practical guidelines for  staff and managers have been issued in order to the  exercise to be a continuous process that improves  employee engagement and drive business results.  The adopted 2017 learning and development plan  offered further diversification of learning pathways  with the use of the various Commission framework  contracts, addressing learning at and through work,  knowledge sharing, training modules, language  courses, etc.  Objectives and performance indicators (ICS 5)  The 2017 work programme, part of the 2017-2019  programming document, was developed by the  agency’s services, with continuous input and guidance  from its two governing bodies, the Management  Board and the Permanent Stakeholders Group.  The programming document clearly sets out how  the planned activities at each management level  contribute to the achievement of objectives, taking  into account the resources allocated and the risks  identified. The programming document’s objectives  are established on SMART (specific, measureable,  achievable, relevant, time-bound) criteria and are  updated or changed during the year in order to  address significant changes in priorities and activities.  The role of the Executive Board is to assist  in preparing decisions to be adopted by the  Management Board on administrative and budgetary  matters only.  The agency has based the measurement of its  performance on key performance indicators that  are applied to all areas of activity. Key performance  indicators are more qualitative for the agency’s  operational goals, whereas they are more  quantitative for the agency’s administrative goals.  The effectiveness of key controls is assessed using  relevant key performance indicators, including self- assessments that have been carried out in the form  of progress reports and follow-up actions that seek to  realign divergences from the work programme.  ENISA installed the project management tool Matrix,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the agency again managed to optimise  the budget execution for 5 consecutive years. The  commitment rate of budget appropriations available  for the year 2017 (C1) reached 99.99 %.  Risk-management process (ICS 6)  The agency did not have any open audit  recommendations for 2017. The IAS performed a  risk assessment of the agency in September 2016.  The report showed the next three topics for auditing:  stakeholders’ involvement in the deliverables, human  resources and IT. The agency will take immediate  action to construct a quality management system and  to implement its risk-management policy.  The first audit topic on involvement of stakeholders  on ENISA deliverables was performed during the last  week of September 2017. The draft report will be  communicated to the agency in the first half of 2018.  Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned  and communicated by means of the Executive  Director’s decisions. It conforms to regulatory  requirements and is appropriate to the level of  importance of the decisions to be taken as well as  the risks involved. All delegated authorising officers  have received and acknowledged the charter of the  role and responsibility of the authorising officer (by  delegation), along with the individual delegation  Executive Director’s decision.  The agency again  managed to optimise  the budget execution  for 5 consecutive years.  The commitment rate of  budget appropriations  available for the year  2017 (C1) reached 99.99 %.  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  The agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been  taken to avoid potential conflict-of-interest situations.  However, due to the small size of the agency, the  mobility of staff in sensitive functions is very limited  and takes into account service needs and available  resources. Proper back-ups are designated in order to  ensure business continuity and adequate segregation  of duties.  Processes and procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen  the processes and procedures ICS. The agency  created a policy on financial circuits. The roles and  responsibilities of financial actors are described  in this policy, along with existing workflows (see  comment on the ‘Paperless’ application in ICS 11).  A code of professional conduct for ex ante financial  verification was developed. The document  emphasises the role and responsibilities of the  financial verifying agent.  The agency proceeded in 2017 with the full 2016 ex  post control exercise, and it will deliver the 2017 ex  post control report in the first semester of 2018.  Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities  for which they are responsible and tracks the main  issues identified. The management team, which  comprises the Executive Director and the heads of  departments and units, meets on a monthly basis and  sets priorities for the actions to be taken in order to  achieve the short- and medium-term objectives of the  agency. A list of action items is compiled. It contains  all agreed actions as allocated to specific departments  or units. The list is published on a dedicated intranet  page and regularly reviewed by the management  team. Besides the monthly management team  meeting, a heads-of-unit meeting is organised every  week. Management supervision covers both legality  and regularity aspects (i.e. set-up and compliance  with applicable rules) and operational performance  (i.e. achievement of programming-document  objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in  order to address accepted ECA and IAS audit  recommendations and monitors the implementation  of these action plans throughout the year.  59ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017  60  Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational  activities and financial transactions — are in place to  ensure the continuity of all services during ‘business- as-usual’ interruptions (such as sick leave, staff  mobility, migration to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT business continuity plan (BCP) has been  developed and implemented. An agency-wide BCP,  designed to cover crisis response and recovery  arrangements with respect to major disruptions,  has been developed and fully implemented. The  agency BCP’s identifies the functions, services and  infrastructure that need to be restored within  certain time limits and the resources necessary for  this purpose. Electronic and hard-copy versions of  both BCPs are stored in secure and easily accessible  locations that are known to relevant staff.  Document management (ICS 11)  Document-management systems and their related  procedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory  security measures; (2) provisions on document  management; and (3) rules on the protection of  personal data. Information security policy specific  to data categorisation and labelling is in place. As  regards the exchange of information classified at the  ‘Restreint UE/EU restricted’ level, an administrative  arrangement between the Security Directorate of the  European Commission and the agency was signed on  27 May 2011.  An internal document-management guide sets out  the conditions according to which documents need  to be registered, filed and saved using the agency’s  registration and filing systems. A special, intranet- based tool was developed to capture the information  needed to register and retrieve documents. In  addition, an incoming- and outgoing-mail procedure  was developed.  As regards the financial and administrative workflows,  in January 2015 ENISA adopted a SharePoint-based  application, ‘Paperless’, which routes documents  to staff involved in the preparation, review and  approval of all kinds of work-related documents  and transactions. All financial and administrative  workflows are well documented and all supporting  documents are uploaded and stored in ‘Paperless’,  including changes and comments by workflow actors.  Approved workflows are permanently stored and an  appropriate audit trail is produced.  Information and communication (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices  are in place for sharing information and monitoring  activities. These include regular Management  Team meetings during which issues relevant to  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 61  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  performance, audit results and financial information  are discussed and actions are decided upon and  assigned. Regular financial reporting is available to  all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All engagements in new  projects are discussed during the implementation  of the annual work programme and decisions are  documented and communicated.  An external communication strategy is in place. ICT  security policies are in place for main systems and  subsystems and are described in procedures and  policies. Internal communication is also supported  through use of the intranet and through weekly staff  meetings within units. External communication and  dissemination procedures must be further developed  and communicated to staff accordingly.  The weekly staff meeting is used as a platform for  communication between all departments. Every week  staff members can share their work with the rest of  the agency.  Accounting and financial reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are  documented in the agency’s internal control manual.  The preparation, implementation, monitoring and  reporting on budget implementation is centralised  in the Finance, Accounting and Procurement Section,  within the Stakeholders Relations and Administration  Department. The European Commission’s budget  and accounting management system, ABAC, is  the main tool used for financial management. It  is compliant with applicable financial regulatory  frameworks. The ABAC Assets module is used for  the management of ENISA’s inventory. Financial  management information produced by the agency,  including financial information provided in the annual  activity report, complies with applicable financial and  accounting  rules.  Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to  measure the performance and assess the impact of  the agency’s projects as provided for in its annual  work programmes. The general report and the annual  activity report are the tools used by the agency to  report on performance and impact. The feedback of  relevant stakeholders is taken into account.  Assessment of internal control systems (ICS 15)  Each year ENISA’s management assesses the  compliance of annual activities and performance  with the internal control systems in place, as part of  preparation of the annual activity report.  Internal audit capability (ICS 16)  The head of the Stakeholder Relations and  Administration Department assumes the internal  control coordination function. He is responsible for  implementing internal control systems in the agency  and liaising with the IAS of the European Commission.  Given the limited size of the agency, the role of  internal audit capability cannot be performed. Since  2005 the agency has relied on the IAS to carry out  internal audits. The IAS plays a key role in auditing  bodies of the European Union.  Internal control tasks performed in ENISA include  100 % of ex ante verifications, annual ex post controls,  hierarchical controls and outsourced engagements,  coordinated by the internal control coordination. The  role of internal control coordination was reinforced in  order to comply with all the recommendations issued  by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that  have the required knowledge and skills; (2) systems  and procedures designed and implemented to  manage the key risks effectively; and (3) no instances  of ineffective controls that have exposed the agency  to substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of  the continuous improvement of management  procedures. It includes taking into account any control  weaknesses reported and exceptions recorded.  62  IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 63  4.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The risk framework is used as a common means  of classifying and communicating risk across the  agency. It provides a common understanding and  language regarding risk, along with a structure for the  assessment, reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk  framework defines the categories, subcategories and  business risks applicable at the organisational level  for ENISA as a whole. It includes:  risk categories and subcategories;  risks specific to each category (business risks);  risk definition.  The agency’s operations are channelled through the  following activity areas that belong to administrative  functions.

Management assurance  4.2 EXCEPTIONS  In 2017 the agency recorded 31 exceptions.  Some of these 31 exceptions are ones that generated  interest payments to suppliers. The others are  administrative mistakes for which corrective  measures have been implemented to prevent the  repetition of these errors.  Twenty-five of them are under the materiality levels  and are minor administrative mistakes.  Of the six remaining, three a posteriori commitments  were reported, two were late payments to the  European Commission and the last was a purchase  order on which the amount exceeded the limit.  The information reported in Parts II and III stems  from the results of auditing by management and  auditors. These reports result from a systematic  analysis of the evidence available. This approach  provides sufficient guarantees as to the completeness  and reliability of the information reported, and results  in complete coverage of the budget delegated to the  Executive Director of ENISA.  66  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 67  5. PART I PART V DECLARATION OF  ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  In my capacity as authorising officer,  Declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view.

ANNUAL  ACTIVITY  REPORT 2017  2  THE ANALYSES AND ASSESSMENT BY THE MANAGEMENT BOARD OF ENISA  OF THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 2017 OF  THE AUTHORISING OFFICER OF ENISA  The Management Board takes note of the Annual Activity Report (AAR) for the financial year  2017, submitted by the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) in accordance with Article 47 of the Financial Regulation applicable  to ENISA.  The Management Board received a copy of the 207 Annual Activity Report produced by the  Executive Director of ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the implementation of the  annual budget on 13 June 2018.  In analysing and assessing the AAR 2017, the Management Board makes the following  observations:  The AAR presents key results of the implementation of the ENISA Work programme 2017 and  leads to conclusion that the Agency completed all deliverables agreed with the Management  Board both within time and within budget.  ENISA produced 43 reports on different aspects of network and information security.  A relevant set of published reports, papers, workshops, meetings and events are listed as  part of the result achieved by the Agency. Impact indicators show that the Agency's results  exceeded the targets established in the Work Programme 2017, against the framework of the  ENISA Strategy 2016–2020.  At the same time, the benefits of ENISA’s work in the context of the security of network and  information systems directive (NIS directive) 1 was observed even before the deadline for its  transposition into national law of May 2018. In 2017, ENISA delivered important results in the  context of activities regarding the implementation of the NIS directive. An important element  of the NIS directive and of capacity building across the EU is the ‘Reference security incident  classification taxonomy’, which was agreed upon by ENISA and the European CSIRT community.  2017 was a year in which the previous work and impact of ENISA was reviewed by external  consultants. The successful outcome of this review was presented in the Cybersecurity  package 2, which includes a communication renewing the EU cybersecurity strategy and  the draft cybersecurity act. The draft cybersecurity act covers (i) a proposal for a renewed  mandate for a stronger ENISA to serve the cybersecurity needs of Europe and (ii)  a cybersecurity certification framework proposal.  In 2017 there was an increased focus on communicating ENISA’s work and concepts to the  European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, along with other EU agencies  and regional organisations. Following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA organised several  high-profile events such as the workshop during the 2017 EU Cybersecurity Conference in  Tallinn, in collaboration with the Estonian Presidency, two editions of the ENISA Industry Event  and the Annual Privacy Forum. ENISA also hosted 14 important thematic workshops and  sessions, gathering together experts in the field to discuss cybersecurity topics.  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures for a high common  level of security of network and information systems across the Union. 2  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity#usefullinks  ENISA MANAGEMENT  BOARD ASSESSMENT  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 3  Two major European projects were also supported by ENISA: the EU Cyber Security Month  — a specific month dedicated to activities on cybersecurity and security/privacy awareness—  and the EU Cybersecurity Challenge event — a competition based on a series of technical  challenges between teams of students and school pupils from different Member States.  In 2017 ENISA received the EU Ombudsman Award for Good Administration for Excellence in  Innovation – Transformation.  Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work Programme 2017 and ENISA’s work is well  aligned with the overall European Union agenda for digital single market. A coherent  link is provided between activities planned in the Work Programme 2017 and the actual  achievements reached in the reporting period.  The AAR also describes ENISA’s management of resources and the budget execution of the EU  subsidy. The expenditure appropriations were committed at a rate of 99.99 %. The respective  payment rate on expenditure appropriations was 88.19 % in 2017. This section also describes  that the agency performed the ‘job screening’ benchmarking exercise for 2017. Support  functions represents 19.28 % of the total statutory staff count, which is below the 25 %  maximum value accepted for the European Union agencies.  The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2015 Discharge, and control results. The agency had  no open recommendations from the Internal Audit Service in 2017. This section also notes the  main categories of deviation that led to exceptions reported. In 2017 the agency recorded 31  exceptions. 25 of them are under the materiality levels and are minor administrative mistakes.  Of the six remaining, three a posteriori commitments were reported, two were late payments  to the European Commission and the last was a purchase order on which the amount exceeded  the limit.  The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate management of risks, high level of  transparency, data protection, business continuity, as well as efforts were undertaken to  improve overall efficiency in all activities.  The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration of assurance of the Executive Director as  well as additional information on human and financial resources, draft annual accounts and  financial reports, as well as performance information included in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the achievements of ENISA in 2017. In the view  of the Management Board, the overall performance and quality of the outputs was high.  The Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA could deliver work programme  2017 in spite of high staff turnover and under condition of limited budgetary resources. The  Management Board expresses its appreciation to the Executive Director and his staff for their  commitment and achievements throughout the year.  The Management Board notes that the Executive Director has no critical issues to report which  would affect the presentation of the annual accounts for the financial year 2017 to the discharge  authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management Board requests the Management Board  Secretariat to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to the European Commission, the  European Parliament, the Council, the Permanent Representations of the Member States and  the Court of Auditors.  41  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 51  TABLE OF CONTENTS ENISA Management board assessment 2 A message from the Executive Director 8 Introduction 11  PART I  ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2017 WORK  PROGRAMME 17  1.1  KEY RESULTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 1 — EXPERTISE: ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT  EUROPE IN FACING EMERGING NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY CHALLENGES 18 1.1.1 Objective 1.1.

On 13 September 2017 the Commission adopted a cybersecurity package 3, which  includes a communication renewing the EU cybersecurity strategy and the draft  cybersecurity act. The package builds upon existing instruments and presents new  initiatives to further improve EU cyber resilience and response. The draft cybersecurity  act covers (i) a proposal for a renewed mandate for a stronger ENISA to serve the  cybersecurity needs of Europe and (ii) a cybersecurity certification framework proposal.  The proposed act promotes a permanent and updated mandate for the agency, which  has now been given political support at the highest level with the adoption of the Council  conclusions.  2017 was also a year in which the previous work and impact of ENISA was reviewed by  external consultants. The successful outcome of this review supports and is evidence of  what we all believed, namely that ENISA has made a positive contribution to cybersecurity  in Europe over the last several years.  The success of our agency is built on the efforts, dedication and commitment of all staff  members, on the stimulating collaboration with its stakeholders and on the effective  strategic cooperation with the Management Board. I would like to take this opportunity to  thank all of them for their significant contributions and efforts in 2017.  ENISA reached its main objective in 2017: it successfully completed the work programme  in a timely manner and within the constraints of its budget. Please find in the  introduction section a summary with highlights of ENISA activities during 2017, and in the  next sections details on how they were carried out.  In the broader context, more work is required to secure cyberspace and guarantee a safe  and secure digital economy for EU citizens.  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity#usefullinks  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/cybersecurity#usefullinks  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 9  During 2017 we witnessed several large-scale ransomware attacks that affected critical  functions of our society such as hospitals and transportation. At the same time, the  materialisation of internet of things (IoT) attacks has given a further demonstration of the  potential damage that can result from malevolent manipulation of this technology.  More work is required to address these new challenges. At the same time, we are also  seeing the benefits of the work in the context of the security of network and information  systems directive (NIS directive) 4 emerging even before the deadline for its transposition  into national law of May 2018. In 2017 ENISA delivered important results in the context of  activities regarding the implementation of the NIS directive. For instance, ENISA produced  a number of deliverables supporting the work streams established in the Cooperation  Group 5, namely incident notification, baseline security measures and identification of  operators of essential service provides.  As we look towards the future, there is no doubt that 2018 will be a challenging year.  With our staff and our stakeholders we will support the implementation of the renewed  EU cybersecurity strategy while looking forward to the adoption of the proposed  cybersecurity act.  I believe in the future of ENISA, and I am looking forward to the proposed new stronger  ENISA and to the agency playing its role in the safe EU cyberspace of tomorrow.  Udo Helmbrecht Executive Director, European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  4 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures for a high  common level of security of network and information systems across the Union. 5 The official body providing guidance on the EU-wide efforts related to the implementation of the NIS  directive.  101  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 111  THE EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  IN BRIEF  The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA) was established in 2004  by Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European  Parliament and the Council. Regulation (EU)  No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 21 May 2013 concerning the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security  introduced a small change in the name, updated its  objectives and extended its mandate until 19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and  information security and cybersecurity in Europe.  ENISA supports the European Union and its Member  States in enhancing and strengthening their ability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond  to network and information security problems and  incidents. ENISA’s vision is to secure and enable  Europe’s information society and to use its unique  competencies to help to drive the cyber landscape  in Europe.  The agency works closely with members of both  the public and private sectors to deliver advice and  guidelines based on solid operational experience. ENISA  also supports the development of EU policies and  laws on matters relating to network and information  security (NIS), thereby contributing to economic growth  in the EU’s internal market. Last but not least, ENISA  coordinates the pan-European cybersecurity exercise,  which is unique in its scope and impact and brings  together all of the EU Member States every 2 years to  test their cooperation mechanisms while working in  their own operational environments.  In 2017 there was an increased focus on  communicating ENISA’s work and concepts to the  European Parliament, the Council and the European  Commission, along with other EU agencies and  regional organisations. Regular meetings with various  Commission services, and with the Directorate- General for Communications Networks, Content and  Technology in particular, took place during the year.  THE YEAR IN BRIEF  The key achievements of 2017 are as follows.  ENISA produced 43 reports on different aspects of  NIS. These include the latest version of the ENISA  threat landscape, guidelines and best-practice  recommendations regarding privacy-enhancing  technologies. Additionally, ENISA reports focused  on issues including but not limited to security and  privacy in mobile environments, standardisation  (including aspects of the eIDAS regulation 6 and  the emerging area of certification of products.  6 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and  of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market.  INTRODUCTION  12  ENISA initiated the process of assisting Member  States in implementing the security of network  and information systems directive (NIS directive),  the first piece of EU-wide legislation on  cybersecurity that provides legal measures to  boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  As defined by the NIS directive, in its role as  secretariat of the computer security incident  response teams (CSIRTs) network, ENISA has  engaged all 28 EU Member States and their  designated CSIRTs, together with EU institutions,  in the development of rules and procedures on  implementing the NIS directive by supporting  operational cooperation among EU Member  States during cyber crises such as WannaCry  and NotPetya, supporting working groups and  dedicated meetings.  ENISA supported the organisation of CSIRTs  network meetings, including the first meeting  in Malta, the second in Estonia and the third  in Greece. The third meeting took place at the  campus of ENISA’s headquarters in Heraklion,  Greece, and saw the participation of CSIRT  representatives from all EU Member States,  the European Commission and the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions,  bodies and agencies (CERT-EU).  An important element of the NIS directive and of  capacity building across the EU is the ‘Reference  security incident classification taxonomy’, which  was agreed upon by ENISA and the European  CSIRT community.  Following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA  organised several high-profile events such as  the workshop during the 2017 EU Cybersecurity  Conference in Tallinn, in collaboration with the  Estonian Presidency, two editions of the ENISA  Industry Event and the Annual Privacy Forum.  ENISA also hosted 14 important thematic  workshops and sessions, gathering together  experts in the field to discuss cybersecurity topics.  Two major European projects were also supported  by ENISA: the EU Cyber Security Month — a  specific month dedicated to activities on  cybersecurity and security/privacy awareness —  and the EU Cybersecurity Challenge event — a  competition based on a series of technical  challenges between teams of students and school  pupils from different Member States.  Finally, ENISA compiled a data breach severity  assessment tool, in close collaboration with  several Member States’ data protection  authorities, with the aim of setting up a coherent  framework at EU level.  While not being exhaustive, these achievements  amply illustrate the variety of ways in which the  agency contributes to a stronger and more secure EU.  Achievement of strategic priorities  and objectives  In 2017 the agency delivered against its annual work  programme, and all outputs and deliverables met or  exceeded the key performance indicators set (see  Part I for more details). Notable achievements are  mentioned hereunder, along with examples of how  the agency reached its goals.  ENISA continued to deliver on the priorities of its  strategy, including work in areas supporting the  digital single market (and on specific technologies  such as the IoT), incident reporting, eIDAS regulation,  privacy and trust. 2017 was a year that saw ENISA  supporting the implementation of the NIS directive  in regard to baseline security measures, incident  reporting and the identification of criteria for  operators of essential services (OES). The agency  also supported the Member States and the European  Commission on the NIS directive provisions related to  digital service providers.  Key achievements include the following.  In the context of the NIS directive, the agency  produced a number of deliverables supporting  the work of the respective working streams  established within the Cooperation Group, namely  incident notification, baseline security measures  and the identification of OES (see performance  indicator for outputs O.1.1.1, O.2.2.2 and O.2.2.6).  In supporting the implementation of the NIS  directive ENISA also engaged stakeholders in  specific OES sectors (e.g. air transport, finance and  healthcare) to better understand and document  examples of sectorial specificities vis-à-vis the  sectorial requirements. Relevant input is provided  to the Cooperation Group (horizontal and sectorial  standards) to enhance its specific knowledge  of these sectors (see performance indicator for  output O.2.2.6).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 13  INTRODUCTION  As part of its activities to develop baseline security  recommendations for the IoT in the context of  critical information infrastructure, ENISA organised  together with Europol an IoT Security conference  that was attended by over 250 participants and  achieved significant visibility in the community.  Also, more than 30 IoT stakeholders and experts  were involved in the relevant study, including  the ENISA IoT Security Experts Group and the  European Commission’s DG Communications  Networks, Content and Technology (see  performance indicator for output O.1.1.2).  ENISA published a study to promote the uptake  of cyber insurance by assessing the level of  harmonisation of the risk assessment language  in cyber insurance and supporting further  convergence in the industry. The study has been  widely referenced and the recommendations  have been adopted by associations promoting  harmonised wordings. The respective validation  workshop received significant visibility and was  attended by over 50 participants, including 24  insurance companies and 41 companies from  14 Member States overall, while a total of 51  insurance carriers, brokers and reinsurers from  12 Member States participated in the study (see  performance indicator for output O.3.3.2).  ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies (NCSS) and updated the  EU NCSS map. The new version of the map was  built on the work performed in previous years and  presents the Member States’ strategic objectives  and good practices in a simple and user-friendly  manner. In addition, ENISA, in cooperation  with the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre,  organised a workshop in The Hague attended by  more than 40 public and private stakeholders.  Overall, 18 Member States participated in the  activities of the agency regarding this output (see  performance indicator for output O.3.1.3).  For the sixth year, ENISA published its annual  report on significant outage incidents in the  European electronic communications sector,  which are reported to ENISA and the European  Commission under Article 13a of the framework  directive (Directive 2009/140/EC) by the national  regulatory authorities (NRAs) of the different EU  Member States (see performance indicator for  output O.1.2.2).  Based on the significant incidents reported by the  supervisory bodies of the different EU Member  States, ENISA produced the first annual incident  analysis report for trust service providers in  the EU under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation  (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014). This report also  placed emphasis on the analysis of the recently  established incident-reporting procedure itself in  an effort to highlight its peculiarities.  More than 100 participants in the 2017 Annual  Privacy Forum: (researchers, policymakers and  industry participants).  Key conclusions on the effectiveness  of the internal control systems and  financial management  ENISA has consolidated internal control standards  (ICS), based on international good practice, that aim  to ensure that policy and operational objectives are  achieved within the applicable legal and financial  framework.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory and the agency  consistently meets its goals in full.  The agency has put in place an organisational  structure and a set of internal controls that are suited  to the achievement of policy and control objectives,  are in accordance with the standards and are suitable  for mitigating risks associated with the environment  in which it operates.  The current set of 16 ICS lays down the minimum  requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2017 the agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise and on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies (the  Internal Audit Service of the European Commission  (IAS) and the European Court of Auditors (ECA)). The  agency continues to enjoy full compliance without  audit observation and/or audit qualifications.  14  Notable internal and external events  2017 will stay in cybersecurity history as the year of  ransomware: the year saw large-scale ransomware  attacks that affected critical functions of our society  such as hospitals and transportation. At the same  time, the materialisation of IoT attacks gave a  further demonstration of the potential resulting  from manipulation of this technology. Some further  highlights of the year related to cybersecurity were  as follows.  2017 was a pivotal year regarding the  implementation of NIS directive. Member States  used the platform offered by the Cooperation  Group to discuss good practices relevant to the  transposition of the directive into national law with  a view to achieving a higher level of convergence  as the transposition deadline of May 2018  draws closer.  The year witnessed several highly publicised IoT  security attacks on both commercial products  and critical infrastructure, thus raising relevant  concerns and leading to calls for action towards  stronger cybersecurity for connected objects, as  clearly indicated in the mid-term review of the  digital single market.  2017 was a year in which the operational  cooperation of the CSIRTs network was tested  during cyber crises such as WannaCry and  NotPetya. The CSIRTs network proved its readiness  and ability to cooperate during large-scale security  incidents in the EU.  As underlined by the latest ENISA threat landscape,  2017 was the year in which incidents in the  cyberthreat landscape led to the definitive recognition  of some omnipresent facts. The agency gained  specific evidence regarding monetisation methods,  attacks on democracies, cyberwar, the transformation  of malicious infrastructure and the dynamics  within threat-agent groups. At the same time a lot  of successful operations against cybercriminals  were launched. Law enforcement, governments  and vendors managed to shut down illegal dark  markets, deanonymise the darknet and arrest  prominent cybercriminals. Moreover, state-sponsored  campaigns were revealed and details of technologies  deployed by nation states were leaked.  Nonetheless, despite law enforcement activities and  capability building, the cybersecurity market is failing:  implemented measures and increased investment  have not yet brought a decline in successful incidents.  The cybersecurity community — with the support of  ENISA — has to continue its fight against cybercrime  in a coordinated manner. Cybersecurity skill shortage  is aggravating the race towards inverting current  cyber-incident trends.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 15  INTRODUCTION  I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 17  1. PART I PART I ACHIEVEMENTS  IN THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE 2017 WORK  PROGRAMME  This Consolidated annual activity report 2017 follows  the structure of the amended 7 2017 ENISA work  programme to assist the reader in understanding  the achievements of the year. The 2017 work  programme was aligned with the structure of the  ENISA strategy document 8, which was created with  the aim of supporting ENISA’s Executive Director  and Management Board in the production and  adoption of consistent multiannual and annual  work programmes 9. This strategy defines five  strategic objectives that form the basis of future  multiannual plans 10.  These strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA  regulation, along with inputs from the Member States  and relevant communities, including the private  sector. They state that ENISA, in cooperation with  and in support of the Member States and the Union  institutions, will carry out the following tasks.  7 The work programme was amended in September 2017 to  address the changes in ENISA’s activities linked to the agency’s  new role as defined in the Computer Emergency Response Team  for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU) regulation. 8 ENISA strategy 2016-2020, available at: https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  9 In accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning ENISA. 10 In order to achieve the multiannual strategic objectives laid  out in this document, the multiannual work programme provides  prioritised mid-term operational objectives to be achieved  by ENISA within a period of 3 years. Annual specific activities  (outputs) are identified in the annual work programme, using a  recursive approach in order to achieve the mid-term operational  objectives and, in the long term, the strategic objectives.  #Expertise: anticipate and support Europe in  facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the  evolutions of the digital environment.  #Policy: promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the EU  institutions and Member States in developing and  implementing EU policies and law related to NIS.  #Capacity: support Europe in maintaining state-of- the-art network and information security capacities,  by assisting the EU institutions and Member States in  reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community: foster the emerging European network  and information security community, by reinforcing  cooperation at EU level among EU institutions,  Member States and relevant NIS stakeholders,  including the private sector.  #Enabling: reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving  the management of its resources and engaging  more efficiently with its stakeholders, including the  EU institutions and Member States, as well as at  international level.  In the following sections the results of the  implementation of the 2017 work programme are  presented for each of the abovementioned activities.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  18  After the description of the specific results for  each activity and output, the achievements against  indicators and the detailed results for each output are  presented in tables.  Furthermore, the 2016 work programme impact  indicators for which a target value was set for 2017 or  2018 have been included in Section 2.6 to follow up  their result and impact. These can only be measured  in the medium and long term.  1.1 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 1 —  EXPERTISE: ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT  EUROPE IN FACING EMERGING  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  CHALLENGES  1.1.1 Objective 1.1. Improving the  expertise related to critical information  infrastructure  1.1.1.1 Output O.1.1.1 — Baseline security  recommendations for the operators of essential  services sectors  The key objective of this output was to assist the  Member States by providing guidance and supporting  material on the implementation of Articles 14(1)  and (2) of the NIS directive, which refer to measures  with a view to achieving a high common level of NIS  security within the EU. ENISA achieved this objective  by engaging with the NIS directive Cooperation  Group and private stakeholders and by leveraging  its existing knowledge and expertise in the area of  standards and good practices on security measures  and risk assessment.  Specifically, the agency supported the Cooperation  Group by collecting and analysing the current and often  common approaches to the security measures of OES.  The outcome of these activities significantly helped the  Cooperation Group to produce a reference document  with security measures for public and private actors to  improve their cybersecurity. All 28 Member States and  17 OES from various essential sectors were engaged  in the development of baseline security requirements  for OES. A workshop for the energy sector was  held in Athens in September and was attended by  representatives of 14 Member States and 21 OES.  Finally, ENISA provided detailed examples of  implementation, lists and mapping tables of  standards and good practices on risk-assessment and  risk-management methodologies relevant to these  security measures.  1.1.1.2 Output O.1.1.2 — Baseline security  recommendations for IoT in the context of critical  information infrastructure  ENISA defines the IoT as a cyber-physical ecosystem  of interconnected sensors and actuators, which  enables intelligent decision-making. With a great  impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy, the  IoT threat landscape is extremely complex. Therefore,  it is important to understand what exactly needs  to be secured and to implement specific security  measures to protect the IoT from cyberthreats. The  2017 ENISA report on IoT cybersecurity provides  experts, developers, manufacturers, decision- makers and security personnel with a guide to good  practices and recommendations on preventing and  mitigating cyberattacks against the IoT. This report  lists the sensitive assets present in the IoT, as well  as the corresponding threats, risks, attack scenarios,  mitigation factors and possible security measures  to implement. More than 30 IoT stakeholders and  experts from more than 10 Member States were  involved in the study, including the ENISA IoT Security  Experts Group and DG Communications Networks,  Content and Technology. Moreover, more than 250  participants attended the IoT Security conference  that ENISA organised together with Europol in  October. The deployment of baseline security  recommendations into the IoT ecosystem will be  critical to the proper functioning of these devices  by mitigating and preventing cyberattacks. The  March 2018 UK government report Secure by design:  improving the cybersecurity of consumer internet of  things took stock of the ENISA study on baseline  security recommendations, along with several other  ENISA studies, for example on smart cars, airports  and hospitals. ENISA received an invitation to and  presented the Baseline security recommendations  for IoT study at the Mobile World Congress 2018 in  Barcelona, an event that attracted more than 107 000  participants.  1.1.2 Objective 1.2. NIS threat landscape  and analysis  1.1.2.1 Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA  threat landscape  The ENISA threat landscape (ETL) report enjoys major  attention within Member States and the Commission,  and also among experts and lay communities. This  objective follows up on past achievements to deliver  an overview of the cyberthreat landscape, along with  a series of related information. This material seeks to  be very comprehensive.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 19  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  In 2017 the ETL was further developed to include  more interactive elements both in the presentation  and in the dissemination of related information.  The impact of the ENISA TL is varied.  It is used as a consolidated summary of existing  material in the area of cyberthreats.  It provides strategic and tactical information that  can be used within security-management tasks.  It can be imported into risk-management  methods.  It can be used as basis for building up threat  intelligence.  It can be used for training purposes.  The ENISA collection and analysis process can be  used by other organisations to create their own  threat landscapes.  In 2017 the team developing the ETL organised  the first European event in the area of cyberthreat  intelligence to address challenges and open issues  in the related community. The success of the event  has exceeded expectations by having some 150  participants who delivered vivid discussions and a  comprehensive exchange of knowledge and ideas.  The ETL provides information regarding reduction  of threat exposure. This information consists of  available controls that can reduce the exposure  and consequently mitigate the resulting risks. In  addition to the report the agency made available to  the public all relevant material as it was collected  during the year.  In carrying out this work, synergies with related  experts (i.e. the ENISA TL Stakeholder Group) and  vendors have been exploited. The agency will  invest in visualisation and quick availability of the  resulting material.  In 2017 the ENISA threat landscape was accompanied  by an end-user application (a web application  available at https://etl.enisa.europa.eu) that will  provide available information online. In this manner  ETL users will be in the position to access ENISA threat  information on a permanent basis. This platform may  be used to integrate additional relevant information.  The ETL continues to be a key deliverable. It has been  referenced by stakeholders from all Member States.  Several thousand downloads and several hundred  references have been made. Moreover, various  articles have reported on ENISA TL findings.  As an indicator, the ETL has achieved following  impact.  ENISA threat landscape is cited in the UK  cybersecurity strategy.  ENISA threat landscape is mentioned in a  Commission fact sheet about cybersecurity.  ENISA threat landscape delivers input for topics  under the Horizon 2020 programme.  ENISA threat landscape information is being used  by the Council to raise awareness.  ENISA threat landscape is used as material for  cybersecurity courses in universities.  ENISA threat landscape is cited on Wikipedia.  1.1.2.2 Output O.1.2.2 — Annual incident analysis  report for the telecom sector (Article 13a)  For the sixth year, ENISA published its annual report  on significant outage incidents in the European  electronic communications sector, which are reported  to ENISA and the European Commission under  Article 13a of the framework directive (Directive  2009/140/EC) by the NRAs of the different EU  Member States. The 2017 report covers the incidents  that occurred in the previous year and gives an  aggregated analysis of the incident reports about  severe outages across the EU.  Some key findings from the 158 major incidents  reported include the identification of mobile internet as  the service most affected by such outages and system  failures as the dominant root cause of incidents.  The annual incident analysis report is compiled based  on the data provided by Member States. In order to  facilitate collection and strengthen the relationship  The ETL continues to  be a key deliverable.  It has been referenced  by stakeholders from  all Member States.  Several thousand  downloads and several  hundred references  have been made.  https://etl.enisa.europa.eu  20  with NRAs, ENISA organised three meetings during  the year, attended by almost all EU NRAs. The agency  also developed an online tool so Member States can  submit their incidents online.  1.1.2.3 Output O.1.2.3 — Annual incident analysis  report for trust service providers (Article 19)  This report provides an analysis and evaluation of  the incident-reporting procedure in the EU under  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation. Considering the fact  that incident reporting was only implemented as from  the second half of 2016, and moreover that this was  the first time that supervisory bodies had performed  this exercise, only one incident was notified to ENISA.  Future incidents reported under the provisions of  Article 19, especially those with cross-border impact,  could potentially have a highly damaging impact.  Therefore, ENISA is paying a lot of attention to the  particularities of Article 19-related incidents, as even  apparently non-critical incidents can create significant  impact across multiple Member States.  In order to facilitate this process ENISA manages a  subject-matter expert group from the authorities from  most of the Member States. The group meets twice a  year to debate the incidents, along with other topics.  1.1.3 Objective 1.3. Research and  development, innovation  1.1.3.1 Output O.1.3.1 — Guidelines for European  standardisation in the field of ICT security  This activity provided an assessment of the situation  of European standardisation in the area of ICT  security, taking into account the new requirements  and priorities associated with the NIS directive  (and with the Commission’s communication on the  Cybersecurity Public–Private Partnership (cPPP). In  addition, the output of European standardisation  in the area of trust services was analysed with a  view to establishing suitability and coherence with  policy goals.  While carrying out this work, ENISA consulted with  industry and standards organisations (e.g. the  European Telecommunications Standards Institute  (ETSI), the European Committee for Standardisation  (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardisation (Cenelec)) as appropriate, mainly  through expertise that was mobilised to produce  reports, and standardisation conferences (e.g. ETSI  Security Week).  1.1.3.2 Output O.1.3.2 — Priorities for EU  research and development  In 2017 ENISA worked closely with the European  Cyber Security Organisation and the cPPP on  cybersecurity in order to align the work being carried  out with the ENISA work programme. In addition,  the agency offered support to the National Public  Authority Representatives Committee by offering a  secretariat function.  Also during the year ENISA looked into current best  practices and guidelines for protecting EU systems  and networks, and put in place an analysis of areas  covered by the NIS directive, such the general  data protection regulation and the Commission’s  decision on the cPPP, and provided guidance on  where research and development activities funded  in the context of the Horizon 2020 programme,  the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), Training of  Network Security Incident Teams Staff and the Gigabit  European Academic Network would achieve the  greatest impact.  1.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response  to Article 14 requests under  expertise activity  1.1.4.1 Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests  under expertise activity  The outcomes of the Article 14 requests under policy  activity for 2017 are as follows.  Following a request from the green parties of  the European Parliament, a briefing note about  artificial intelligence was provided covering  different aspects of the impact of this technology,  including economic, social and privacy issues. The  discussion was continued at the Annual Privacy  Forum in Vienna and in subsequent meetings.  ENISA received a request from the European  Commission to study and measure the impact of  key reinstallation attack vulnerability in order to  provide further advice to citizens. An info note  was created giving detailed information about the  issue and providing different lines of actuation  in order to prevent and mitigate the impact of  the vulnerability.

Supporting EU policy  development  ENISA continued to provide the Commission and  the Member States with high-quality information,  data and advice to support policymaking with an  EU dimension.  In the policy development area the agency  cooperated with public- and private-sector  stakeholders to develop insights, consolidate views  and provide recommendations in areas in which the  EU takes action to further develop its policy. Examples  of such cooperation included the domains of IT  security certification and the digital single market.  1.2.1.1 Output O.2.1.1 — Support the policy  discussions in the area of IT security certification  The work of ENISA gained new impetus through  the proposed cybersecurity act, which also includes  an important component on the EU cybersecurity  certification framework. This proposal complements  other recent legislative and policy initiatives, such as  the NIS directive and the Commission position on  the cPPP. The agency is gradually becoming more  empowered to continue supporting the Commission  and the Member States in identifying a certification  framework for ICT security products and services  that on the one hand boost competition, and on the  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/mapping-of-oes-security-requirements-to-specific-sectors/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2017/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-reports-2016 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-incident-analysis-report-for-the-trust-service-providers https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/improving-recognition-of-ict-security-standards/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/priorities-for-eu-research/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-article-14-requests/  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 23  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  other promote mutual recognition or harmonisation  of certification practices up to a certain level. The way  conformity assessment is carried out in European  certification laboratories was an area of specific  policy activity; it complemented involvement with  stakeholders in two different certification workshops  throughout 2017.  ENISA also reached out, with the discussion on  certification, to standardisation organisations  (ETSI etc.), ICT certification stakeholders (test labs,  certification and accreditation bodies, the Senior  Officials Group Information Systems Security,  Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement, etc.)  and ICT security product users (the European Smart  Metering Industry Group, Eurosmart, etc.) as forums  to enhance the dialogue around security certification  and build upon the existing results these initiatives  have developed in the past.  1.2.1.2 Output O.2.1.2 — Restricted: towards a  digital single market for high-quality NIS products  and services  ENISA conducted a study to perform a thorough  mapping of the EU NIS start-up ecosystem in the  EU using a multifaceted approach that addressed  technology and innovation aspects, the policy and  regulatory context and the funding side from a  Member State, EU and private-sector perspective in  light of the digital single market strategy. The study  focused on identifying the opportunities available  to EU NIS start-ups and the obstacles potentially  hindering their growth prospects. Twenty-four  individual start-ups and 10 funding-side organisations  (including key venture capitalists and business  accelerators) covering 10 sectors participated in  the study, either via interviews or by attending the  validation workshop.  This report helped ENISA to advise the Commission  and Member States in better identifying where  efforts should be focused in order to further  support NIS innovation within the EU and allow  start-ups to reach their full potential by leveraging  the opportunities that arise from the digital single  market. Start-up Europe, the Commission’s initiative  designed to connect start-ups, investors, accelerators,  entrepreneurs etc., expressed significant interest in  the findings and recommendations and has adopted  a number of them as guidelines for future activities.  The report proposed guidelines and  recommendations to strengthen NIS innovation  within the EU, while a workshop was organised and  co-hosted by DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology’s Start-ups and Innovation Unit to  bring together different stakeholders from the NIS  start-up ecosystem and present the main findings.  1.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy  implementation  1.2.2.1 Output O.2.2.1 — Contribute to EU policy in  the area of the electronic communications sector  Since 2011 ENISA has supported work in the area  of the electronic communication sector. In this  respect, three meetings were organised with the  Article 13a Expert Group and one technical project  was developed (interconnect security dealing  with SS7/Diameter) in 2017. Overall, 38 electronic  communications providers and 28 national bodies  (NRAs) participated in the study. Since the results of  the study are still being debated and validated with  the industry and national authorities, the study will be  published later in 2018.  A strong relationship has been developed with the  Commission and multiple inputs have been provided  as regards the development of the new EU Electronic  Communications Code. Every year ENISA tackles  at least one technical topic, as recommended by  Article 13a (e.g. a topic that represents a concern to  many authorities across the EU).  In 2017 ENISA also continued its work in the area  of privacy in electronic communications (e-privacy)  and provided relevant technical opinions on online  tracking and relevant user protection mechanisms.  1.2.2.2 Output O.2.2.2 — Develop guidelines  for the implementation of mandatory incident  reporting  ENISA is an active member of the Cooperation Group,  the official body providing guidance on EU-wide  efforts related to implementing the NIS directive.  Within the incident notification working stream  established within the Cooperation Group, ENISA  produced the deliverable Reference document on  incident notification for operators of essential services,  which serves as a main guideline for Member States  when addressing the topic of incident notification.  The document provides insights on how incident- notification provisions can be implemented at  national level, highlights potential discrepancies in  terms of incident reporting across different industries  and further contributes to EU-wide harmonisation.  The work represents a landmark in the work on  incident reporting within the NIS directive, as more  documents remain to be produced in the next years.  24  It sets the baseline on further developing incident  reporting policies across the Member States.  The document was produced based on input from the  Member States and taking into account the previous  work done by the agency in the area of telecom and  trust service providers. The work in this working  stream was coordinated by the Dutch representation  in the Cooperation Group. Overall, 49 private  stakeholders and 20 public stakeholders contributed  to the study.  1.2.2.3 Output O.2.2.3 — Recommendations  supporting implementation of the eIDAS  regulation  ENISA supported public and private bodies in  implementing the eIDAS regulation by addressing  technological aspects and building blocks for  trust services.  Furthermore, ENISA developed a set of  recommendations and guidelines addressed to the  all the involved stakeholders: trust service providers,  supervisory bodies and conformity assessment  bodies. More than 20 experts in the area of trust  services stakeholders were involved in preparing and  validating the reports. The reports were disseminated  through different communication channels, with the  European Commission’s distribution channels being  the DG Informatics–Communication and Information  Resource Centre for Administrations, Businesses  and Citizens mailing list, the Article 19 ENISA Expert  Group mailing list and ENISA contacts through the  Trust Services  Forum. The findings of the reports  were presented in several different workshops and  conferences, including the Trust Services Forum, the  Article 19 ENISA Expert Group, ETSI Security Week,  World e-ID and Trust Services compliance info day on  eIDAS. Moreover, a survey was carried out to examine  the implementation and uptake of trust services  under the eIDAS regulation.  1.2.2.4 Output O.2.2.4 — Recommendations for  technical implementation of the general data  protection regulation  Technical measures in the area of data protection  have been a key part of the involvement of ENISA  in this policy area in an effort to support the  implementation of the general data protection  regulation. ENISA made available a set of  recommendations that allow data controllers and  data processors to properly support such aspects  as consent, right to erasure, data portability, data  breaches, accountability, anonymisation versus  pseudonymisation, etc. ENISA also continued its  work on privacy-enhancing technologies, apps and  methods, along with certification for data protection  to provide stakeholders with the necessary support.  1.2.2.5 Output O.2.2.5 — Privacy-enhancing  technologies  ENISA has delivered practical guidelines on how to  implement privacy and data protection by design and  default. In 2017 the agency developed a community  building tool prototype that aims to create and  maintain a repository of best available techniques  for privacy-enhancing technologies, further building  on evaluating new techniques and keeping lists of  techniques available. The practical functionalities of  this tool were tested.  In this fifth edition, the Annual Privacy Forum was  used to bring together key communities across  research, policy and the industry to disseminate work  in this area.  1.2.2.6 Output O.2.2.6 — Supporting the  implementation of the NIS directive  In 2017 ENISA built on the work performed during  the previous years with the aim of supporting the NIS  Directive Cooperation Group by providing guidance  and supplemental material on the implementation of  Articles 5 and 6 of the NIS directive, which refer to the  identification of OES.  In this respect ENISA collected the well-established  approaches different Member States use to identify  their OES. In total, 19 Member States participated  in this study. The agency analysed the collected  information and identified common features that  could constitute a basis for a harmonised approach.  The outcome of this work was the key feedback into  the activities of the NIS Directive Cooperation Group  work stream on the identification of OES.  This work was not concluded in 2017 but will continue  in 2018. During this period ENISA will continue  helping Member States to develop more knowledge  and expertise on this topic and will contribute by  providing input to the activities of the Cooperation  Group work stream.  Furthermore, ENISA, in its activities to support  the implementation of the NIS directive, engaged  stakeholders from the air transport, finance and  healthcare sectors to understand the respective  sectorial specificities. A set of recommendations  and good practices, related to incident reporting  for instance, has already been provided to the  Cooperation Group to enhance its knowledge of  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 25  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  the cybersecurity situation in each of the sectors of  the NIS directive. Additional recommendations and  good practices will be provided to the Cooperation  Group if requested as the focus shifts from the  horizontal aspects of the NIS directive to sectorial  implementation in 2018.  Under these activities ENISA organised two very  successful workshops, contributing to the discussions  on the implementation of the NIS directive. The first  one was the annual meeting of the ENISA expert  group on finance, where the need to streamline  the requirements of the NIS directive and the  payment services directive II was raised. The second  workshop was the third edition of the eHealth  security workshop, which was this year co-hosted  with the Portuguese Ministry of Health. The workshop  reached a large number of relevant stakeholders.  Furthermore, ENISA has raised awareness of the  NIS directive by participating in workshops with  hospital representatives in Belgium, Greece, Latvia  and Portugal. In the air transport sector the request  for cybersecurity training in collaboration with the  European Aviation Safety Agency was the highlight of  a very successful year. ENISA will continue to support  these sectors in implementing the NIS directive in the  coming years.  1.2.3 Objective 2.3. Response to Article  14 requests under policy activity  1.2.3.1 Output O.2.3.1 — Response to requests  under policy activity  The 2017 outcomes of the Article 14 requests under  policy activity are as follows.  ENISA supported the establishment of the NIS  directive Cooperation Group work stream on the  dependency of OES and digital service providers  on operators that function across borders in EU.  In particular, after a formal request (cf. Article 14  of the agency’s regulation) from Estonia, ENISA  drafted the proof-of-concept paper for this area  of activity. The paper demonstrates the need  for such a work stream, in the context of the NIS  Cooperation Group, by illustrating the complexity  and the challenges around this subject matter.  Following a request from the European Central  Bank, ENISA has started providing expertise in the  development of a Eurosystem red team testing  framework for financial market infrastructures.  ENISA is involved in validating and enriching the red  teaming framework, which involves the Bank and  all 28 Member States’ central financial authorities.  ENISA’s contribution consists of meetings at the  Bank’s premises and providing comments and  input on follow-up documents. The work is ongoing  as the request will require activities through the  first and second quarters of 2018.  Following a request from the Greek Ministry  of Health, ENISA prepared a full-day workshop  focusing on the NIS directive and the healthcare  sector. The workshop served the purpose of raising  awareness regarding the NIS directive among  key stakeholders from the sector in Greece. To  that end ENISA gave a detailed presentation of  the directive and the relevant provisions to an  audience of over 80 representatives of Greek  hospitals and other healthcare organisations,  and coordinated a discussion on cybersecurity in  healthcare focusing on the main challenges and  the exchange of good practices.  ENISA received a request from the Commission’s  Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety  to support the eHealth Network’s activities  on cybersecurity for healthcare, which will be  carried out within the joint action on eHealth  (health programme 2017). Specifically, ENISA has  been asked to actively participate in Task 7.3,  ‘Data and system security’, of work package 7,  which addresses the issues on ‘Implementation  challenges and impact’. Activities related to this  request will begin in 2018.  Following a request from the European Aviation  Safety Agency, ENISA has been assisting that  agency on the subjects of sectorial implementation  of the NIS directive and cybersecurity in aviation.  In this context ENISA is currently supporting the  creation of the European Aviation’s information  sharing and analysis centres (ISACs), which will  provide a platform for cybersecurity information  exchange across Europe. Moreover, ENISA is  organising dedicated cybersecurity training  courses for the aviation sector. A first training  course for air carriers took place in 2017 in  collaboration with the European Aviation Safety  Agency. Due to the high demand a second one will  be organised in the second quarter of 2018. Topics  also include cybersecurity for avionics (training  led by the European Aviation Safety Agency) and  artefact analysis (forensics led by ENISA).  26  1.2.4 General results: achievement of performance indicators for Activity 2  Summary of outputs in Activity 2 — Policy: promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority Outputs Performance indicator Achieved results  Objective 2.1.

Assist Member  States’ capacity building  One of the main goals of this objective was to develop  and improve activities related to the operational  security capacity-support programme. In 2017 ENISA  continued to build upon its work in the operational  security area by providing technical training materials  for CSIRTs to support the improvement of technical  skills across Europe. The goal is to support Member  States through a dialogue with relevant stakeholders  in order to be ready for the technical challenges of  the coming years. Another main goal of this objective  was to help the EU Member States and other ENISA  stakeholders, such as the EU institutions, bodies  and agencies, to develop and extend the necessary  capabilities in order to meet the ever-growing  challenges of securing their networks.  1.3.1.1 Output O.3.1.1 — Support national and  governmental CSIRTs capabilities  In 2017 ENISA concentrated its efforts on assisting  CSIRTs by, for example, leveraging its role as  secretariat of the CSIRTs network as defined in the  NIS directive. In close cooperation with CSIRTs, the  agency supported the development of Member  States’ national incident response capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions  of NIS capacity building with a focus on the  development and efficient functioning of national and  governmental CSIRTs.  The main objective of this output in 2017 was to help  Member States and other ENISA stakeholders, such  as EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop  and extend their incident response capabilities and  services in order to meet the ever-growing challenges  to secure their networks. Currently all Member States  connected to the internet have CSIRT capabilities,  but the level of maturity among them still varies  dramatically. It is ENISA’s mission to continue to help  minimise those differences.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/recommendations-on-european-data-protection-certification https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/certification_survey https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/overview-of-the-practices-of-ict-certification-laboratories-in-europe/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/online-tracking-and-user-protection-mechanisms/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trust-services/technical-guidance-on-qualified-trust-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/qwacs-plugin/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eidas-overview-on-the-implementation-and-uptake-of-trust-services/  28  In 2017 ENISA published a study on the maturity  aspects of CSIRTs, tailored to the national teams  expected to join the CSIRTs network. The study takes  all relevant information sources into account, with  a special emphasis on the NIS directive, the various  ENISA reports on CSIRT capabilities, maturity and  metrics, and on the security incident management  maturity model for CSIRTs, which is a good practice  that has been widely used in Europe for several  years. Additionally, ENISA has organised research to  establish a readily implementable and useable self- assessment survey and peer review methodology.  More than five Member States that had already  experienced the CSIRT certification process supported  this research. The primary target audience for the  report is the EU CSIRTs network teams and their  management. However, the report, and especially the  maturity self-assessment that it contains, will be of  use to all CSIRTs all over the world.  As part of a continuous effort, ENISA maintains  and regularly updates its online European CSIRT  Inventory. In 2017, in light of the implementation of  the NIS directive, ENISA concluded a major usability  makeover of the tool, which now has new features  and is more user friendly. The new features of the  tool include very detailed graphics and statistics on  the participation of CSIRTs in different communities,  membership status and contact details. The listing  features 342 teams from 45 countries, a major  increase that shows the continuous expansion of  CSIRTs globally. This tool now allows the reader to  filter the displayed teams by NIS directive CSIRTs  network membership.  1.3.1.2 Output O.3.1.2 — Update and provide  technical training for Member States and  EU bodies  In 2017most of the activities in this area aimed at  maintaining and extending the collection of good- practice guidelines and training courses for CSIRT and  other operational personnel. The agency supported  the development of Member States’ national incident  response preparedness by providing good-practice  guidance on key elements of NIS capacity building,  with a focus on CSIRT training and services in order to  improve the skills of CSIRT teams and their personnel.  Over the past several years ENISA has developed a  wide range of cybersecurity training courses, and  delivered the training content to several national  and governmental CSIRTs and their constituents. In  detail, with the emphasis that the NIS directive places  on the importance of the seven critical sectors, the  agency aimed to identify the current situation in these  sectors with regard to the available cybersecurity  training courses, and whether there are any training  needs specific to each of the sectors, beyond the  generic needs for such training. In this regard, ENISA  produced a set of deliverables providing:  stocktaking results on the current situation for  each of the NIS directive critical sectors with  regard to the available cybersecurity training  courses; and  recommendations on what could be done with  ENISA’s training portfolio in order to improve  the suitability of that portfolio for the existing  training needs.  In 2017 ENISA also delivered, for the first time,  sector-specific training for technical specialists in  the aviation sector. The training media campaign  led to 110 requests for participation from different  organisations in both the private and the public  sector in all Member States. Due to the enormous  amount of applications, priority was given to the  target audience (airports, air carriers and air traffic  control personnel), coverage of Member States and  relevance to the training.  Moreover, regarding good practices for CSIRT services,  ENISA and the CSIRT community jointly set up a task  force with the goal of reaching a consensus on a  reference security incident classification taxonomy.  The task force is composed of representatives of 41  CSIRTs from 16 Member States. Thanks to the task  force’s efforts, ENISA consolidated the results into a  document that was published in January 2018 and  paved the road towards efforts to build a common  language to face future incidents, also in light of the  implementation of the NIS directive.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 29  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  1.3.1.3 Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU Member  States in the development and assessment of  national cybersecurity strategies  In 2017 ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of NCSS by updating  the EU NCSS map. The new version of the map  was created on the basis of the work performed in  previous years and presents the Member States’  strategic objectives and good practices in an easy and  user-friendly manner.  In addition, ENISA, in cooperation with the Dutch  National Cyber Security Centre, organised a workshop  in the Hague. The focus of the workshop was on  collaboration, a topic not only fundamental to the  objectives of a strategy but also highlighted in several  pieces of legislation, such as the NIS directive and  the new cybersecurity act. In this workshop ENISA  validated the results of two reports created to  provide guidelines and support the output of this  activity: one for cooperative models on public–private  partnerships (PPPs) and one for cooperative models  on ISACs. The documents depict the status of ISACs  and PPPs with regard to cybersecurity in Europe  through well-informed maps.  In total, 18 Member States participated in the activities  of ENISA regarding this output. Representatives from  14 Member States attended the workshop.  1.3.2 Objective 3.2. Support EU  institutions’ capacity building  1.3.2.1 Output O.3.2.1 — Restricted and public info  notes on NIS  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events  and developments through info notes. Info notes  are explanatory notes, regarding, for example,  events that reach a certain level of public and media  attention. Relevant NIS events might cover incidents,  significant developments and announcements in the  field of cybersecurity.  ENISA has provided balanced and neutral information  regarding such events, covering issues, points of action,  mitigation measures, summaries, related practices, etc.  In 2017 ENISA fulfilled its intention to continue  providing info notes in a timely manner as a reliable  and continuous service to its stakeholders.  Output O.3.2.2 — Restricted: upon request, support  the assessment of existing policies/procedures/ practices on NIS within EU institutions  In 2017 a report was drafted as a joint effort  between DG Communications Networks, Content  and Technology and ENISA, who were tasked  with presenting an overview of relevant sectorial  initiatives at the EU and international levels in the  field of cybersecurity. The information included in the  document was presented to the Cooperation Group  to ensure that both the members of the Cooperation  Group and the relevant actors at Member State level  involved in the transposition process for the NIS  directive have a clear picture of the work that has  already been conducted in the field.  This document builds on the work conducted by  ENISA in 2016, validated by multiple directorates- general, and maps the main stakeholders at EU level,  along with the relevant policy framework in the field  of cybersecurity across key sectors covered by the  NIS directive: energy, transport, banking and finance,  health and drinking water.  The resulting document is conceived as a ‘living’  document, and will be regularly updated by the  Commission services and ENISA to inform the  Cooperation Group about any developments that  might be relevant for the transposition process.  Considering the sensitive nature of the information  that ENISA received from the EU institutions, this  deliverable was restricted in distribution.  1.3.2.2 Output O.3.2.3 — Representation of  ENISA on the Steering Board of CERT-EU and  representation of the EU agencies using CERT-EU  services  In 2017 a new service agreement with CERT-EU  was put in place for ENISA. For the aforementioned  agreement, ENISA has the formal task of representing  the EU’s decentralised agencies.  In this context ENISA participated in the Steering  Board of CERT-EU, representing itself and the EU’s  decentralised agencies to ensure that the needs of  these bodies are adequately represented.  1.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist private-sector  capacity building  1.3.3.1 Output O.3.3.1 — Cybersecurity culture:  from identifying the issues to providing working  scenarios for management level  ENISA has conducted a study that contains guidance  and practical tools for organisations on developing  and maintaining an internal cybersecurity culture.  30  The Cyber security culture in organisations report is  the product of multidisciplinary research undertaken  in order to better understand the dynamics of how  cybersecurity culture can be developed and shaped  within organisations. This research draws from  disciplines that include organisational sciences,  psychology, law and cybersecurity, along with the  knowledge and experiences gathered from some  of Europe’s largest organisations. The report itself  contains good practices, methodological tools and  step-by-step guidance for those seeking to commence  or enhance their organisation’s own cybersecurity  culture programme.  1.3.3.2 Output O.3.3.2 — Recommendations  on cyber insurance  ENISA conducted a study to assess the level of  harmonisation of the risk assessment language  in cyber insurance. The lack of harmonisation/ standardisation was found to have a significant  negative impact on the broad adoption of cyber- insurance products and several recommendations  were developed to support the cyber-insurance  market in achieving a higher level of language  commonality. The report was based on input  provided by stakeholders covering the full supply  spectrum of the cyber-insurance market, focusing on  carriers, underwriters and brokers. In all, 51 insurance  carriers, underwriters, brokers and reinsurers  and 58 companies in total from 12 Member States  participated in drafting the recommendations via  interviews and an online survey.  A very successful workshop was held in Brussels,  with over 90 registrations for participation from  multiple stakeholders from the fields of industry,  academia and policy. In all, 24 insurance companies  and 41 companies in total from 14 Member States  participated in the workshop on validating the  recommendations. The workshop contributed to  the discussions on the maturity and standardisation  of the cyber-insurance market. The report has  been widely referenced in the community. Its  recommendations were very well received and are  being carefully considered by key stakeholders,  including the OECD, which cites the report in a  relevant publication on the current state of the  cyber-insurance market 11. Some have in fact already  been adopted by associations proposing non-binding  wording models to promote harmonisation in the  market, such as the German Insurance Association.  11 http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/insurance/2018-oecd- conference-cyber-insurance-market.htm  1.3.4 Objective 3.4. Assist in improving  general awareness  1.3.4.1 Output O.3.4.1 — Cyber security challenges  In 2017 ENISA maintained its involvement in the area  of cybersecurity challenges and advised the Member  States on running national Cyber Security Challenge  competitions. The agency has also continued its own  annual European Cyber Security Challenge.  ENISA’s support for national and European activities  targeted university students from technical schools  and young talent, including security practitioners  from the industry. The goals in 2017 were to increase  interest and future opportunities in NIS for these  communities by promoting excellence in the form of  competitions and to gather feedback on the areas of  interest from these stakeholders.  The success of ENISA’s Cyber Security Challenge is  evidenced by the participation in the event, held in  Malaga, Spain, of more than 150 contestants from  15 different EU and European Free Trade Association  (EFTA) countries.  1.3.4.2 Output O.3.4.2 — European Cyber Security  Month deployment  European Cyber Security Month has continued to  outperform original expectations, as evidenced by  the increased number of participants and activities,  and the increased engagement year on year. In 2017  ENISA focused on providing guidance to Member  States’ campaigns and techniques to better evaluate  the impact of awareness raising.  1.3.5 Objective 3.5. Response to Article  14 requests under capacity activity  1.3.5.1 Output O.3.5.1 — Response to requests  under capacity activity  During 2017 ENISA delivered training to the European  Parliament, the European Aviation Safety Agency,  Latvia, Romania and Sweden on topics such mobile  malware, artefact analysis, and incident handling and  response. The feedback was highly positive, with only  minor comments on possible course improvements.  http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/insurance/2018-oecd-conference-cyber-insurance-market.htm http://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/insurance/2018-oecd-conference-cyber-insurance-market.htm  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 31  PART I.

Cyber crisis  cooperation  1.4.1.1 Output O.4.1.1 — Evaluation of Cyber  Europe 2016 and report on exercise after-action  activities from 2014 to 2016  In 2016 ENISA organised the fourth pan-European  cyber-crisis exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016).  The pan-European exercises organised by ENISA are  producing a number of significant recommendations  and actions for all of the involved stakeholders. It  is extremely important to ensure follow-up and to  monitor the progress of all these actions. Otherwise,  the added value from the lessons learned from the  exercise is diminished.  In early 2017 ENISA performed an in-depth analysis  of the evaluation data gathered from the exercise.  This resulted in a detailed after-action report that was  published together with a related video on ENISA’s  website 14 in summer 2017.  First, the exercise fostered cooperation between  targets of simulated cybersecurity incidents, security  providers and national authorities, shedding light  on national-level public–private and private–private  cooperation. Second, CE2016 helped participants  understand how cybersecurity authorities would  cooperate with each other and EU bodies in the  event of a large-scale crisis. Undoubtedly, crisis  cooperation at the EU level is maturing and  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber- europe-programme/ce-2016  improving greatly. Last, the exercise offered countless  opportunities for participants to enhance their  cybersecurity capabilities, from their technical and  operational expertise to their capacity to handle  crisis communication. Organisational and individual  cybersecurity preparedness and capabilities in the EU  were excellent overall.  1.4.1.2 Output O.4.1.2 —  Planning of Cyber Europe 2018  In 2018 ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European  cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2018 (CE2018). This  exercise will closely follow up and build upon the  lessons learned and actions from previous exercises,  such as CE2014 and CE2016.  CE2018 will focus on testing and training on large- scale incident management cooperation procedures  at the EU and national levels. It will offer preparatory  The exercise offered  countless opportunities  for participants  to enhance their  cybersecurity  capabilities, from their  technical and operational  expertise to their  capacity to handle crisis  communication.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme/ce-2016 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme/ce-2016  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 35  training and cooperation opportunities, such as small  exercises, to Member States and the EU institutions  (e.g. Cyber SOPEx). The exercise’s escalation and  build-up will be realistic and focused in order to  better capture how incidents are managed and how  cooperation happens in real life. The exercise will  include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs network set  up under the NIS directive.  In 2017 the agency, together with the cybersecurity  authorities (planners) from the Member States,  developed a comprehensive exercise plan for CE2018.  A dedicated task force has developed an extensive  scenario with over 10 different types of cybersecurity  incidents relevant to the essential sector of aviation,  affecting airports, air carriers, civil aviation authorities  and internet service providers who provide services  to the aviation industry.  The exercise will be held in summer 2018. A trailer for  this exercise was produced in 2017 and published 15  early in 2018.  1.4.1.3 Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for cyber  exercise planning and cyber crisis management  Cyber Exercise Platform development and content  management  In 2014 ENISA started to develop the Cyber Exercise  Platform (CEP). CEP hosts a number of services  that ENISA offers to the Member States and EU  institutions, such as exercise organisation and  management, an exercise playground with technical  incidents, a map of exercises and hosting the  15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCDOp7_hsjY  exercise-development community. In 2017 ENISA  maintained and enhanced the experience offered by  CEP, including user support. It added support for the  Virtual Exercise Universe, a set of online applications  emulating real-life platforms such as social media,  mainstream media, expert blogs, dedicated/ specialised sites, the online presence of hackers, etc.  Also in 2017 ENISA developed a Cyber Incident  Visualisation tool, which includes a map that  visualises the occurrence of incidents. During the  year ENISA also developed an online training and  education platform to support exercise preparation  and other related activities of the agency.  In addition, new content and exercise incident  challenges and material were developed in order  to maintain the interest of stakeholders and make  CEP a central tool in cybersecurity exercising for  all stakeholders, in the form of ad hoc on-demand  exercises (Cybersecurity Technical Exercises — CTEx).  The CTEx database of incidents includes over 40  incidents ranging from malware analysis, network  forensics, mobile malware, steganography, offensive  and defensive capture-the-flag games, etc.  If you are interested in organising such an exercise  contact: c3@enisa.europa.eu  EU-level cyber-crisis and incident management  procedures and Connecting Europe facility  cybersecurity digital service infrastructure  During 2017 ENISA started activities for the future  takeover of the management and operations for the  centralised components of the MeliCERTes platform,  formerly known as CEF CSP Cybersecurity DSI Core  Service Platform.

As the body with final responsibility for MeliCERTes,  and the body in charge of maintaining it, ENISA is  currently following the development of the platform  closely, and is actively supporting the Commission  and the consortium of national CSIRTs in the various  activities that are being carried out. At the same time the  agency is building its capability to gradually take over the  parts of the infrastructure as implemented.  ENISA is expected to implement some of the systems  and functionalities for the management, maintenance  and further development of the MeliCERTes platform,  together with the development of some of the related  internal and external operational process.  Blueprint  In 2017 ENISA supported DG Communications  Networks, Content and Technology in its activities  related to cyber-crisis management and in  preparation for the release of the blueprint  proposal 16 in parallel to the cybersecurity act.  16  Commission Recommendation on 'Coordinated Response  to Large Scale Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises' consists of  a Blueprint for Coordinated response to large-scale  cross- border  cybersecurity incidents and crises http://ec.europa.eu/ transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2017/EN/C-2017-6100-F1-EN-ANNEX- 1-PART-1.PDF so that the EU has in place a well-rehearsed plan in  case of a large scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis.  ENISA experts drafted papers, supported CSIRTs  network working groups and represented the  agency in crisis-management workshops in  Brussels. Additionally, the specifications of a  prototype aimed at supporting the production of  EU cybersecurity technical situation reports, as  defined in the blueprint proposal, were drafted with  the assistance of an external expert in machine  learning and natural-language processing. The  specifications of this prototype were used as the  foundations for a public tender worth EUR 80 000  released in January 2018.  1.4.2 Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building  1.4.2.1 Output O.4.2.1 — Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and  law enforcement agencies  In 2017 the key goal for ENISA, of supporting the  collaboration between CSIRT and law enforcement  communities, was served by analysing the technical,  legal and organisational aspects of this collaboration.  In addition to the publication of two reports in  this area, the annual workshop for national and  governmental CSIRT and their law enforcement  counterparts was organised together with Europol’s  European Cybercrime Centre and inter alia it  demonstrated that full-circle policy should mean  involving judiciary authorities.  CSIRT's Network meeting - October 2017  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 37  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  1.4.2.2 Output O.4.2.2 — EU CSIRT network  secretariat and support for EU CSIRT network  community building  In 2017 ENISA supported the Commission and  Member States in the implementation of the  NIS directive, in particular in the area of incident  response. As part of this activity ENISA has  an active role as CSIRTs network secretariat  and actively supports cooperation among the  CSIRTs. Moreover, ENISA provides expertise and  assistance, as envisioned by the NIS directive,  by developing guidance and good practices in  the area of operational community efforts, such  as on information exchange or CSIRTs maturity  assessments.  As defined by the NIS directive in its role as CSIRTs  network secretariat, ENISA has engaged all 28 EU  Member States and their designated CSIRTs in  developing rules and procedures. The CSIRTs network  secretariat has engaged them in the implementation  of the NIS directive through dedicated physical  meetings (in Malta, Estonia and Greece) and working  group activities, and, last but not least, by supporting  operational cooperation during cyber crises such as  WannaCry and NotPetya.  Furthermore, the agency contributed to the dialogue  between NIS-related communities, including between  CSIRTs and law enforcement and data-privacy  communities, in order to support a consistent EU- wide approach to NIS.  Through the CSIRTs network working groups, more  than 10 Member States CSIRT representatives actively  participated in activities that improved operational  cooperation and information sharing among CSIRTs  in Europe.  In addition, ENISA took an active role in supporting  the CSIRTs network in activities relevant to the  CEF work programme. ENISA also successfully  developed and managed the main communications  infrastructure of the CSIRTs network that was  assigned to the agency.  1.4.3 Objective 4.3. Response to Article  14 requests under community activity  1.4.3.1 Output O.4.3.1 — Response to requests  under community-building activity  The outcomes of the Article 14 requests under policy  activity for 2017 are as follows.  Following the Article 14 request by another EU  agency, the European Agency for the Operational  Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the  Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, ENISA  supported the organisation, planning, conduct and  evaluation of the exercise on the visa information  system (VIS). In particular, ENISA trained that  agency’s personnel and exercise planners from  the Member States on the exercise management  methodology. In addition ENISA helped them  to apply the methodology in the organisation  of the VIS exercise by providing templates for  all required documentation, supporting the  development of the different products of the  exercise and supporting the conduct and the  evaluation process. ENISA also offered a dedicated  space within the CEP for the VIS exercise and  offered customer helpdesk support.  Following a request from the Science and  Technology Options Assessment of the European  Parliament, ENISA conducted a study with the title  Cyber-security in the EU CSDP — Challenges and risks  for the EU. For this study, ENISA consulted external  stakeholders within and beyond the EU (i.e. NATO,  academia). The study concluded with a set of  proposals from the political down to the tactical  level. The study was subsequently presented in  the European Parliament.  Following a request from the Estonian Presidency,  ENISA assisted the organisers of EU Cybrid 17 17,  the event organised by Estonian Presidency, in  developing the exercise scenario. This exercise  was the first of its kind at the level of ministers of  defence. ENISA also supported and participated in  the exercise during the execution.  Following a request from the European External  Action Service, ENISA provided assistance in  developing the 2017 EU parallel and coordinated  exercise by extending the EU Cybrid17 scenario to  accommodate the needs of the exercise in 2017.  17 https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/EUCYBRID2017  https://www.eu2017.ee/news/press-releases/EUCYBRID2017  38  1.4.4 General results: achievement of performance indicators for Activity 4  Summary of outputs in Activity 4 — Community: foster the emerging European  network and information security community Outputs Performance indicator  Objective 4.1.

Management.  Engagement with stakeholders.  International activities.  Compliance and support.  1.5.1 Objective 5.1. Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall  management of the agency. The Executive Director  has one personal assistant.  To support the Executive Director an Executive  Director’s Office (EDO) has been set up. The tasks  covered by EDO include policy advice, legal advice,  Management Board secretariat, coordination of the  work programme and press communications.  During 2017, policy and legal advice extended to all  aspects of the agency’s work and included advice in  relation to both the operational and administrative  departments of the agency.  In 2017 EDO continued to support the Management  Board and the Executive Board in their functions by  providing secretariat assistance.  In relation to the Management Board, one ordinary  meeting was organised during 2017 and informal  meetings were held as necessary. The Management  Board portal was supported as well. Three meetings  of the Executive Board were held.  1.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement  with stakeholders  Under this objective are grouped some of the  tasks and activities of the agencies carried out in  collaboration with stakeholders.  National Liaison Officers Network.  Permanent Stakeholders Group.  Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities.  Outreach and image building activities.  National Liaison Officers Network  ENISA has kicked off various activities aiming at  strengthening the cooperation with its National  Liaison Officers (NLO) Network. NLOs are key  actors in the agency’s daily work. They are the  liaison between ENISA and the community of  network and information security (NIS) experts and  relevant organisations in their respective Member  State acting as 'ambassadors' and ‘facilitators’ of  ENISA’s work.  In 2017 ENISA built upon these efforts and improved  its cooperation with the NLO Network as the first  point of contact for ENISA in the Member States.  A meeting of NLOs took place in April 2017 to  strengthen ENISA’s cooperation with the NLO  Network. Particular emphasis was placed on how to  improve collaboration, in view of the enhanced role  for NLOs discussed at Management Board level.  The agency maintained, and shared with the NLO  Network, information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities (e.g. unit responsible for the project,  relevant tender results, etc.), while maintaining  available online resources and expanding them  as appropriate.  Information was sent to the members of the NLO  Network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, events  organised or contributed to by ENISA, etc.  In 2017 the Management Board adopted guidelines  on the missions, principles and functioning of the  NLO Network, thus strengthening its role.  Permanent Stakeholders Group  In 2017 ENISA reinforced the contribution of the  Permanent Stakeholders Group to the ENISA work  programme. The current Permanent Stakeholders  ENISA has kicked off  various activities aiming  at strengthening the  cooperation with its  National Liaison Officers  (NLO) Network. NLOs are  key actors in the agency’s  daily work.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 41  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  Group consists of 33 top IT-security experts, who  were appointed following an open call for expression  of interest for membership in 2017.  The current group is composed of nominated  members from two organisations (Europol and Office  of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic  Communications) and one advisory body (the  Article 29 Working Party), and members appointed ad  personam, amounting to 33 members from all over  the European Union, compared with 23 members in  the previous group.  These members constitute a multidisciplinary group  derived from industry, academia and consumer  organisations, and are selected upon the basis of their  own specific expertise and personal merits. Three  nominated members represent NRAs, data protection  authorities and law enforcement authorities.  The Permanent Stakeholders Group was  established by the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013). The Management Board, acting  on a proposal by the Executive Director, sets up a  Permanent Stakeholders Group for a term of office of  2.5 years.  The role of the Permanent Stakeholders Group is to  advise the Executive Director on the development  of the agency’s work programme and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders on all  related issues.  Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities  In 2017 ENISA sought improve its focus on key  activities and engage the highest possible number  of stakeholders. This includes the institutional  stakeholders (e.g. EU Institutions) and other various  groups of such as academia, industry, citizens, etc.  The agency will continue to develop various  communication tools and channels, including the  website, with a strong emphasis on social media.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the  Stakeholder Communication team, which will seek the  appropriate level of outreach activities to take ENISA’s  work to all interested parties and to provide added  value to the European Union.  Outreach and image-building activities  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for  all stakeholders. It is essential that EU citizens can  trust ENISA’s work.  Cybersecurity threats are increasing all over the  world, and Europe is no exception. With this in  mind, ENISA’s image needs to be continuously  strengthened.  The dissemination of the agency work is essential in  creating an NIS culture across the various actors in  Europe. ENISA is aware of this fact, and will aim to  reach all stakeholders who require information about  the work developed by the agency.  Several activities are planned in different Member  States that will strengthen cybersecurity awareness  across Europe, fulfilling ENISA’s mandate, mission and  strategy.  1.5.3 Objective 5.3. International  relations  In 2017 the Management Board adopted guidelines  on international relations.  1.5.4 Objective 5.4. Compliance  and support  The Stakeholder Relations and Administration  Department (SRAD) strives to operate a cost-efficient,  customer-oriented service.  SRAD has contributed to ENISA’s strategy both  internally and externally, seeking optimal solutions  for delivering on ENISA’s mandate.  SRAD seeks to enhance the functionality of the  agency’s administrative procedures, to provide  administration-related services and strategic support  and orientation for the agency’s strategy.  SRAD oversees a variety of programmes, projects and  services relating to personnel, finance, purchasing,  technology, facilities management, health, safety,  security and much more.  SRAD’s aim is to provide high quality services to the  whole organisation and external stakeholders to  ensure the optimal use of the agency's resources  to increase its overall efficiency. Coordination with  the IAS, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the ECA,  the European Ombudsman, etc. is one of the main  tasks in this area. All internal policies related to  transparency, the anti-fraud policy, protection of  whistle-blowers, declarations of interests, etc. are  addressed under this activity.  42  1.5.4.1  Information technology  IT at ENISA must support the organisation’s business  processes and provide the platforms and the tools  needed by the Core Operations Department for the  secure hosting and operation of its IT systems. The  focus is on building formal procedures and processes,  and outsourcing first-level IT support. Moreover,  additional information security tools will be put  in place, such as DMARC (Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) for the  agency’s email and an intrusion-detection system in  cooperation with CERT-EU.  1.5.4.2 Finance, accounting and procurement  The key objective here is to ensure the compliance of  financial resource management with the applicable  rules, and in particular with sound financial  management (i.e. the effectiveness, efficiency and  economy principles), as set down in the financial  regulation. As the agency’s resources are derived from  the EU budget, management is required to comply  with a set of regulations, rules and standards set  down by the EU’s competent institutions. The Finance,  Accounting and Procurement Unit is responsible  for high-quality reporting (annual accounts) and  contribution to the audit and discharge procedures.  In 2017 preparations were made so that in 2018 the  agency will benefit from the deployment of tools  used to simplify and automate its work, automated  applications (budget reporting, procurement  planning), e-Prior (EU Commission platform for the  management of the procurement lifecycle, from pre- award to post-award of a contract).  The deployment of tools, coupled with the  outsourcing of certain low-value activities, improved  the overall resource-management and reporting  capacity of the agency.  The aim is to contribute to the agency’s annual  and multiannual programming, from inception to  execution. Financial resources are allocated according  to the needs expressed by the organisational units  and according to the priorities set by the agency’s  management.  Key objectives for the year 2017 included high  budget-commitment and payment rates, a low  number of budget transfers during the year, planned  and justified carry-overs and reduced average  payment delay.  Task Objective Target set  for 2017  Achieved  in 2017  Consolidate systems and applications on a maximum of two platforms Efficiency 60 % 60 %  Maximise data sharing Efficiency 60 % 60 %  Move the agency’s IT infrastructure progressively to the cloud Efficiency 50 % 50 %  Business applications will be securely available on the most widely used  mobile devices Availability 70 % 70 %  Continuous operations Availability 99 % 99 %  Task Objective Target set  for 2017  Achieved  in 2017  Deployment of new financial-information  systems  Efficiency, better reporting, information  quickly provided 80 % 80 %  Budget implementation (committed  appropriations for the year)  Efficiency and sound financial  management 100 % 99 %  Payments against appropriations for the  year (C1 funds)  Efficiency and sound financial  management 89 % 88 %  Payments against appropriations carried  over from year n – 1 (C8 funds)  Efficiency and sound financial  management 95 % 91 %  Payments made within financial regulation  time frame  Efficiency and sound financial  management 90 % 89 %  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 43  PART I.

The  agency also managed 11 recruitment procedures.  ENISA furthermore adopted a new approach  in terms of learning and development, moving  towards a learning organisation with a number  of activities including new learning opportunities,  managerial workshops and an enhanced process  to identify strategic learning needs. Various other  measures were developed that contributed to a  continuous organisational effort to build a high- performance culture (e.g. a new internal mobility  policy). In addition, the agency offered several  traineeship opportunities enabling young graduates  to acquire practical experience and knowledge of EU  administration and of the agency’s day-to-day work.  1.5.4.4 Internal communication, legal affairs, data  protection and information security coordination  1.5.4.4.1 Internal communication  Internal communication activities aim to keep all those  working within the agency informed and to enable both  management and staff to fulfil their responsibilities  effectively and efficiently. Staff members must be  regularly informed of policy decisions taken by the  Management Board and ENISA’s senior management,  enabling them to better understand their role and to  acquire a broader knowledge of the agency’s mission  and activities. This should contribute to a common  corporate culture, improve staff engagement and  ultimately also improve the implementation of the  work programme. Moreover, it is expected that a new  internal communications strategy will be completed  and implemented in 2018. Thereafter, it is envisaged  that an annual review of this strategy will be carried out  to ensure that it is kept up to date and appropriate for  the agency.  44  1.5.4.4.2 Legal affairs  In 2017 EDO supported the legal aspects associated  with the operations of the agency. These include  dealing with matters such as contracts, procurement,  employment related matters, data protection and  corporate governance matters. The Legal Affairs service  also managed complaints submitted pursuant to  Article 90 of the Staff Regulations and complaints to the  European Ombudsman, and represented the agency  before the Court of Justice of the European Union.  1.5.4.4.3 Data protection compliance tasks and  data protection officer  The main tasks of the data protection officer are  as follows.  Inform and advise ENISA of its obligations  pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and  document this activity and the responses received.  Monitor the implementation and application of  ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data.  Monitor the implementation and application of  Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 at ENISA, including  the requirements for data security, the provision  of information to data subjects and their requests  in relation to exercising their rights under the  regulation, along with the requirements for prior  checking or prior consultation with the European  Data Protection Supervisor.  Monitor the documentation, notification and  communication of personal data in the context of  ENISA’s operations.  Act as ENISA’s contact point for the European Data  Protection Supervisor on issues related to the  processing of personal data.  Inform and advise ENISA on the current status of  the revision of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and  relevant discussions at EU level.  Support ENISA in preparing for the transition to  the new data protection regulation (action plan).  1.5.4.4.4 Information security coordination  The information security officer (ISO) coordinates  the information security management system on  behalf of the authorising officer. In particular, the ISO  advises the ICT Unit in developing and implementing  information security policies, standards, guidelines  and baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality,  integrity and authentication of the agency’s  information systems. The ISO is instrumental in  incident handling and incident response, and in  security-event monitoring. The ISO also leads the  security training for the agency’s staff and provides  security guidance on all IT projects, including the  evaluation and recommendation of technical controls.  In 2017 the ISO contributed to such goals as:  improving ENISA’s security posture by planning  penetration tests and vulnerability assessments;  advising on security policies and updating existing  ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks;  improving internal security training for ENISA staff;  implementing new systems and tools that can  support improvements in IT security.  Throughout 2017 several penetration tests of ENISA  main portals and platforms took place, together  with a comprehensive security-posture assessment.  Key priorities in terms of information security  were identified for the medium/long term. During  the corporate staff meeting the ISO delivered  regular security-awareness-raising presentations.  An important tool (Microsoft Advanced Threat  Analytics) for detecting malicious activities was  deployed internally.  1.6 FOLLOW-UP ON THE RESULT AND  IMPACT OF ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT  BEFORE 2017  This section aims to summarise the result and impact  of activities (work packages) carried out during the  previous year, with indicators set to be evaluated in  current and later years.

All of them have  declared a certain level of compliance  with the general security measures  proposed by ENISA. The SS7 survey had 39 respondents  in 2017. The project checked EU level  status as regards signalling security.  By 2017, 15 Member  States contribute  to ENISA’s efforts  on the harmonised  implementation of  Article 19 of the eIDAS  regulation.  Three meetings of the eIDAS Article 19  expert group were organised in 2016. On  average more than 15 Member States  participated in each of them.  20 Member States contributed to  ENISA’s efforts on the harmonised  implementation of Article 19 of the  eIDAS regulation  SO4 — To enhance cooperation both between the Member States of the EU and  between related NIS communities  WPKs, impact indicators Results achieved by end of 2016 (Annual  activity report 2016) Results achieved by end of 2017  WPK 4.2: Network and information security community building  In 2017, enhanced  operational community  efforts (e.g. operational  cooperation, information  exchange).

ENISA’s work also positively recognised  in other CSIRT structures, e.g. reference  incident classification taxonomy in  TF-CSIRT-TI, CSIRT maturity assessment  framework in FIRST and the Global  Forum on Cyber Expertise.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 49  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2017 work programme  5050  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 51  2.1 BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  2.1.1 Budget execution of EU subsidy (C1  funds)  The excellent budget execution can be translated into  the following figures: the expenditure appropriations for  ENISA’s 2017 budget of EUR 10 608 964 were committed  at a rate of 99.99 % as at 31 December 2017.  ENISA did not cancel any C1 appropriations of the  year (cancellation rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven capacity of the agency to use the entrusted  funds efficiently in order to implement its annual  work programme and to manage its operational and  administrative expenditure.  The respective payment rate on expenditure  appropriations was 88.19 % in 2017. This payment  rate is high and demonstrates that the agency’s  capacity to finalise its annual activities and to execute  the relevant payments within the year of reference  was maintained. The procurement planning, which  was moved forward to the end of the preceding year  (2016) and enabled the agency to launch projects  related to the work programme in early 2017,  contributed significantly to the improvement of the  payment rate of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.2 Amending budgets/budgetary  transfers  The following table summarises the impact of  budgetary transfers Nos 1 to 6 (approved by the  Executive Director of ENISA) on the initial 2017 budget.  2.  PART II MANAGEMENT  Initial budget 2017 budget transfers 1 -6 approved  by the Executive Director Appropriations after transfer 1-6  Title 1 6 387 979.00 0.00 6 387 979.00  Title 2 1 770 700.00 – 45 070.00 1 725 630.00  Title 3 3 086 000.00 45 070.00 3 131 070.00  Total 11 244 679.00 0.00 11 244 679.00  Table — Summary of budgetary transfers 1 to 6 impact on budget  5252  Appropriations after  transfer 1-6 Amending budget 1/2017 New appropriations 2017  (amending budget 1/2017)  Title 1 6 387 979.00 14 638.30 6 402 617.30  Title 2 1 725 630.00 – 132 500.01 1 593 129.99  Title 3 3 131 070.00 48 408.20 3 179 478.20  Total 11 244 679.00 – 69 453.51 11 175 225.49  New appropriations  2017 (amending  budget 1/2017)  2017 budget transfers 7-10 approved  by the Executive Director Final budget execution 2017  Title 1 6 402 617.30 – 4 188.09 6 398 429.21  Title 2 1 593 129.99 7 182.47 1 600 312.46  Title 3 3 179 478.20 – 2 994.38 3 176 483.82  Total 11 175 225.49 0.00 11 175 225.49  Title Total C1  appropriations carried  forward to 2018  Subsidy from Greek  authorities carried forward  (R0 2017 to R0 2018)  Total amount  carried forward from  2017 to 2018  Title 1 — Staff 482 509,75 0,00 482 509,75  Title 2 — Administration 430 128,27 26 370,24 456 498,51  Title 3 — Operations 498 802,49 0,00 287 569,77  Total 1 411 440,51 26 370,24 1 437 810,75  Table — Summary of amending budget 1/2017 impact on budget  Table — Summary of the budgetary transfers 7 to 10 impact on budget  Table — Summary of carry forwards 2017 to 2018  The following table summarises the subsequent impact of the amending budget 1/2017  (approved by the Management Board).  The table below summarises the impact of budget transfers Nos 7 to 10 (approved by the Executive  Director after the adoption of amending budget 1/2017) on the final budget execution.  5.2.1 Carry forward of commitment  appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the EU subsidy (C1 appropriations) that were not  consumed by payments at the end of 2017 were  carried forward (automatic carry forward) to 2018 (C8  appropriations).  The commitment appropriations corresponding to  the subsidy from the Greek authorities for the lease  of the ENISA premises in Greece (external assigned  revenue — R0 appropriations) that were not paid by  31 December 2017 were carried forward (automatic  carry forward to R0 appropriations 2018).  The funds carried forward to 2018 (C8 appropriations)  are detailed below:  The total of cancelled appropriations carried forward from 2016 to 2017 (C8 appropriations of 2017)  but finally not paid in 2017 was EUR 90 916.34.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 53  PART II. Management  2.1.3 Types of procurement procedures  In 2017 a total of 40 procurement procedures were  launched, resulting in 38 contracts being signed  (nine framework contracts, 13 service contracts, one  works contract and 15 specific contracts awarded  under re-opening of competition). Also, 340 purchase  orders (175 of which were issued under pre-existing  framework contracts) were signed.  2.1.4 Interest charged by suppliers  During 2017 the agency had to pay EUR 2 393.93 of  interest to its suppliers as result of exceeding the  payment terms agreed with the suppliers.  2.2 MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN  RESOURCES  2.2.1 Human resources  At the end of 2017, 74 statutory staff were employed  by the agency (42 temporary agents, 29 contract  agents and three seconded national experts). Despite  the great efforts made in the selection procedures  the agency’s attraction and retention capability is still  suffering from a low country-coefficient factor and  the fact that contract-agent posts are not financially  competitive in the cybersecurity job market.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members  in Athens, where no European Schools are based,  several service-level agreements have been  concluded with each of the private schools being  used by the children of staff members. Several  children of staff members at ENISA Heraklion  attended the European School in Heraklion in 2017,  which offers education at the following levels:  nursery, primary and secondary education. ENISA  has a service-level agreement with the Commission’s  DG Human Resources and Security for the provision  of these services.  The organisational chart, establishment plan and  statistics for ENISA staff are included in Annex A.1.  2.2.2 Results of screening  Following the European Commission’s methodology,  the agency performed the ‘job screening’  benchmarking exercise for 2017. The result of  the exercise, which is a snapshot of the staffing  situation as at the end of December 2017, appears  in Annex A.4. It is relevant to mention that the  ‘Overhead’, support functions, represents only  19.28 % of the total statutory staff count, which is  below the 25 % maximum value accepted for the  agencies. This is only possible due to very efficient  resource management.  2.3 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2.3.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multiannual  character of programmes, as well as the nature of  the payments concerned. In order to achieve the best  control possible the agency has focused intensively  on the verification of results before transactions are  initiated (ex ante verification).  In line with ICS 8 (Processes and procedures), the  agency has produced the ex post control report for  the financial year 2016. The recommendations issued  in the report were addressed during the year.  The ex post controls of the financial year 2016 were  quite extensive. A total of 234 financial transactions  were sampled and checked, representing 11.62 %  of all of the agency’s financial transactions and  representing 65.15 % of the agency’s 2016 budget. As  a result, one recommendation was issued regarding  a delay of payment that did not generate any interest  to be paid.  Moreover, the ECA is in charge of the annual audit of  the agency, which concludes with the publication of  an annual report in accordance with the provisions  of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union. For several consecutive years  the ECA’s reports have confirmed the improvement in  the agency’s overall internal control environment and  performance.  2.4 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION TASKS  ENTRUSTED TO OTHER SERVICES AND  ENTITIES  The agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  5454  2.5 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT RESULTS  AND FOLLOW-UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS  2.5.1 Internal Audit Service  The agency had no open recommendations from the  IAS in 2017. In September 2016 the IAS performed the  agency’s risk assessment. The report showed the next  three topics for auditing: stakeholders’ involvement in  the deliverables, human resources and IT. The agency will  take immediate action to construct a quality management  system and implement its risk-management policy. The  audit on stakeholders’ involvement in the deliverables  was performed during the last week of September 2017.  The draft report will be communicated to the agency in  the second quarter of 2018.  2.5.2 European Court of Auditors  Issued in 2017, the 2016 ECA report on the annual  accounts does not contain any recommendations.  2.5.3 Follow-up of audit plans, audits  and recommendations  The agency will continue to improve its internal systems  and remain vigilant with regard to the possible risks  of the activity within the internal legal and financial  framework to strive for the current situation of non- compliance issues attested by the IAS and the ECA.  2.6 FOLLOW-UP OF OBSERVATIONS  FROM THE DISCHARGE AUTHORITY  2.6.1 2015 discharge  Regarding the European Parliament decision  of 27 April 2017, the Executive Director of the  agency was granted discharge in respect of the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the  financial year 2015. The closure of the accounts of the  agency for the financial year 2015 was also approved 23.  2.6.2 Measures implemented in  response to the observations of the  discharge authority  The following table presents a summary of the  main observations and comments by the discharge  authority on the implementation of the 2015 budget  and the measures taken by ENISA.  23 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-// EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2017-0175+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN  Main observations by the  discharge authority  ENISA’s replies and measures  Inclusion of a standard chapter on  transparency, accountability and  integrity in 2016 annual report.  As from the 2017 annual activity report a standard chapter on transparency,  accountability and integrity is included (see next section).  Considerable delay in the payment  of rent for the offices in Athens by  the Greek authorities.  The agency made continued significant efforts in liaising with the Greek  authorities in order to remedy the situation. However, ENISA is dependent on  the good will of the Greek authorities.  Difficulty to recruit, attract and  retain suitably qualified staff.  The agency has implemented social measures (e.g. food vouchers, increased  education allowances) to attract and retain qualified staff.  Adoption of internal rules on  whistleblowing during the first  quarter of 2017.  Internal rules on whistleblowing have been drafted and are under discussion  for formal validation by upper management.  Absence of publication on the  website of the CVs and declarations  of interests of the agency’s  Management Board members and  of its Executive Board.  Declarations of interest and of commitment of ENISA Management Board  representatives can be found here: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/ management-board/mb2017 Only the CV of the Chair of the Management Board is currently available on  ENISA’s website: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/ management-board/jean-baptiste-demaison-cv  Transparency to improve in  contacts with lobbyists and  stakeholders.  In accordance with its legal basis ENISA has to maintain regular dialogue with  the private sector, consumer organisations and academic experts. Internal  rules have been adopted to define and clarify the relationship between ENISA  and its stakeholders to guarantee transparency.  Furthermore, the members of the Management Board are only required  to provide annual declarations of interest and annual declarations of  commitments. These declarations have been published on ENISA’s website.  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2017-0175+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2017-0175+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2017 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2017 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/jean-baptiste-demaison-cv https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/jean-baptiste-demaison-cv  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 55  PART II. Management  2.7 COMPLIANCE REGARDING  TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY  AND INTEGRITY  The agency is committed to operating as an open and  transparent organisation. To help citizens and other  stakeholders understand how the agency is managed  and held accountable, ENISA publishes a wide range  of documents and other relevant information on its  website (https://www.enisa.europa.eu).  In accordance with the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013), the Management Board is the  highest governing body of the agency. It is composed  of representatives of the Member States and the  Commission. Its main role is to ensure that the  agency carries out its tasks in accordance with its  operational and strategic objectives, as adopted  by the agency’s annual and multiannual work  programme. It also supervises all budgetary and  administrative matters.  To ensure transparency on the decisions adopted,  the internal rules of procedures for the Management  Board, the list of its representatives and alternates  and the minutes of the meetings and adopted  decisions (including annual and multiannual work  programmes) are published on ENISA’s website.  The Management Board has also the responsibility  to appoint the Executive Director, who is responsible  for implementing the decisions adopted by  the Management Board and for the day-to-day  administration of the agency.  To ensure the transparency and accountability of  the executive function, the Executive Director has  the duty, among others, to provide an annual activity  report addressed to the Management Board in order  to assess ENISA’s activities. The Management Board  then, in turn, has to analyse and to assess this report.  Once approved, and no later than 30 June of the year  following the year under review, the annual activity  report, which outlines the achievements for the year  and the resources used, is formally adopted and  communicated to the relevant stakeholders (namely  the European Council, the European Parliament, the  European Commission and the ECA). Once approved  it is made publicly available through ENISA’s website.  For further financial transparency, the annual  accounts (including the budgetary execution report)  and the annual adopted budget are also disclosed on  the website.  The Executive Director, representing the agency,  is accountable to the European Parliament for the  execution of the annual budget. The Executive  Director must provide to the European Parliament  all the information necessary for the discharge  procedure. The discharge procedure is the tool for  the Members of the European Parliament to check  how and to what end public funds have been spent.  The European Parliament can then decide to grant,  postpone or refuse a discharge for a specific year.  To help the European Parliament in the discharge  procedure, independent reviews of the agency take  place. On an annual basis, the ECA gives assurance  on the reliability of the annual financial statements  and on the legality and regularity of the transactions  conducted by the agency for the year under review.  The IAS conducts periodic audits on specific topics,  which are selected based on a risk assessment.  The results and follow-ups of these audits must be  included in the annual activity report (see previous  sections). Complementing the external and internal  audits, independent evaluations are carried out to  assess the performance and the long-term impact of  the agency’s operations.  To avoid situations that might impair its  independence or impartiality, the agency has  implemented a comprehensive set of rules on  preventing and managing conflicts of interest.  Accordingly, ENISA’s Management Board, Permanent  Stakeholder’s Group, Executive Director and officials  seconded by Member States on a temporary basis  need to make a declaration of commitments and a  declaration of any interests that might be considered  to be prejudicial to their independence. These  declarations are made in writing.  ENISA has adopted an anti-fraud strategy and  action plan. It achieved a significant result in terms  of awareness raising by preparing and delivering  internal training on fraud prevention to its entire  staff. Periodic training is planned to ensure that staff  are continuously aware about fraud prevention.  As of 2018 fraud-awareness training is included  in the yearly ethics and integrity training, which is  compulsory for all staff.  In addition to the Staff Regulations the agency has  introduced a code of conduct for all staff that offers  comprehensive information and advice on a variety of  issues, ranging from ethics to compliance with legal  obligations. The aim is to ensure that all employees  share the values of ENISA as an open, accessible and  transparent organisation. Furthermore, in accordance  with the code of good administrative behaviour  issued by the European Ombudsman, ENISA is  implementing a 2-week deadline to answer requests  from citizens.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  56  III  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 57  3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT  The agency was previously using the risk assessment  done by the IAS in 2012. In September 2016 the IAS  produced a new risk assessment with an audit plan  that started in 2017.  3.2 COMPLIANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF  INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS  ENISA has adopted a set of ICS, based on  international good practice, that aim to ensure the  achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The agency has also put in place an organisational  structure and internal control systems suited to  the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which  it operates.  In 2010 the Management Board of the agency  adopted a set of 16 ICS laying down the minimum  requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2014 the agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise and on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies  (ECA and IAS). During 2017 the agency achieved  compliance with the ICS listed below.  Mission (ICS 1)  The agency’s mission and scope is described in  the ENISA regulation. Mission statements for  departments and units were established based on the  evolution of the organisation in 2017. The roles and  tasks of each department and unit are clearly defined.  Ethical and organisational values (ICS 2)  The agency has procedures in place — including  updates and yearly reminders — to ensure that all  staff are aware of relevant ethical and organisational  values (e.g. ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of  interest, fraud prevention, reporting of irregularities).  Specific training is organised by the agency for its  staff every year in order to reinforce professional  behaviour, compliance with the expected behaviour,  ethics and integrity, and in order to prevent  workplace harassment.  Staff allocation and mobility (ICS 3)  In 2017 ENISA implemented some structural  organisational adjustments with the objective of  3.  PART III ASSESSMENT OF THE  EFFECTIVENESS  OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS  58  increasing the agility of the organisation in adapting  swiftly to new and diverse challenges. Additionally,  two staff moved voluntary from Crete to Athens.  Staff evaluation and development (ICS 4)  In 2017 the performance-management exercise  (annual appraisal and reclassification) took place  successfully, with only one appeal on the annual  appraisal, well below the rate of appeals in other EU  organisations. Both exercises were conducted in line  with the Staff Regulations and related implementing  rules. Comprehensive and practical guidelines for  staff and managers have been issued in order to the  exercise to be a continuous process that improves  employee engagement and drive business results.  The adopted 2017 learning and development plan  offered further diversification of learning pathways  with the use of the various Commission framework  contracts, addressing learning at and through work,  knowledge sharing, training modules, language  courses, etc.  Objectives and performance indicators (ICS 5)  The 2017 work programme, part of the 2017-2019  programming document, was developed by the  agency’s services, with continuous input and guidance  from its two governing bodies, the Management  Board and the Permanent Stakeholders Group.  The programming document clearly sets out how  the planned activities at each management level  contribute to the achievement of objectives, taking  into account the resources allocated and the risks  identified. The programming document’s objectives  are established on SMART (specific, measureable,  achievable, relevant, time-bound) criteria and are  updated or changed during the year in order to  address significant changes in priorities and activities.  The role of the Executive Board is to assist  in preparing decisions to be adopted by the  Management Board on administrative and budgetary  matters only.  The agency has based the measurement of its  performance on key performance indicators that  are applied to all areas of activity. Key performance  indicators are more qualitative for the agency’s  operational goals, whereas they are more  quantitative for the agency’s administrative goals.  The effectiveness of key controls is assessed using  relevant key performance indicators, including self- assessments that have been carried out in the form  of progress reports and follow-up actions that seek to  realign divergences from the work programme.  ENISA installed the project management tool Matrix,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the agency again managed to optimise  the budget execution for 5 consecutive years. The  commitment rate of budget appropriations available  for the year 2017 (C1) reached 99.99 %.  Risk-management process (ICS 6)  The agency did not have any open audit  recommendations for 2017. The IAS performed a  risk assessment of the agency in September 2016.  The report showed the next three topics for auditing:  stakeholders’ involvement in the deliverables, human  resources and IT. The agency will take immediate  action to construct a quality management system and  to implement its risk-management policy.  The first audit topic on involvement of stakeholders  on ENISA deliverables was performed during the last  week of September 2017. The draft report will be  communicated to the agency in the first half of 2018.  Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned  and communicated by means of the Executive  Director’s decisions. It conforms to regulatory  requirements and is appropriate to the level of  importance of the decisions to be taken as well as  the risks involved. All delegated authorising officers  have received and acknowledged the charter of the  role and responsibility of the authorising officer (by  delegation), along with the individual delegation  Executive Director’s decision.  The agency again  managed to optimise  the budget execution  for 5 consecutive years.  The commitment rate of  budget appropriations  available for the year  2017 (C1) reached 99.99 %.  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  The agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been  taken to avoid potential conflict-of-interest situations.  However, due to the small size of the agency, the  mobility of staff in sensitive functions is very limited  and takes into account service needs and available  resources. Proper back-ups are designated in order to  ensure business continuity and adequate segregation  of duties.  Processes and procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen  the processes and procedures ICS. The agency  created a policy on financial circuits. The roles and  responsibilities of financial actors are described  in this policy, along with existing workflows (see  comment on the ‘Paperless’ application in ICS 11).  A code of professional conduct for ex ante financial  verification was developed. The document  emphasises the role and responsibilities of the  financial verifying agent.  The agency proceeded in 2017 with the full 2016 ex  post control exercise, and it will deliver the 2017 ex  post control report in the first semester of 2018.  Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities  for which they are responsible and tracks the main  issues identified. The management team, which  comprises the Executive Director and the heads of  departments and units, meets on a monthly basis and  sets priorities for the actions to be taken in order to  achieve the short- and medium-term objectives of the  agency. A list of action items is compiled. It contains  all agreed actions as allocated to specific departments  or units. The list is published on a dedicated intranet  page and regularly reviewed by the management  team. Besides the monthly management team  meeting, a heads-of-unit meeting is organised every  week. Management supervision covers both legality  and regularity aspects (i.e. set-up and compliance  with applicable rules) and operational performance  (i.e. achievement of programming-document  objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in  order to address accepted ECA and IAS audit  recommendations and monitors the implementation  of these action plans throughout the year.  59ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017  60  Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational  activities and financial transactions — are in place to  ensure the continuity of all services during ‘business- as-usual’ interruptions (such as sick leave, staff  mobility, migration to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT business continuity plan (BCP) has been  developed and implemented. An agency-wide BCP,  designed to cover crisis response and recovery  arrangements with respect to major disruptions,  has been developed and fully implemented. The  agency BCP’s identifies the functions, services and  infrastructure that need to be restored within  certain time limits and the resources necessary for  this purpose. Electronic and hard-copy versions of  both BCPs are stored in secure and easily accessible  locations that are known to relevant staff.  Document management (ICS 11)  Document-management systems and their related  procedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory  security measures; (2) provisions on document  management; and (3) rules on the protection of  personal data. Information security policy specific  to data categorisation and labelling is in place. As  regards the exchange of information classified at the  ‘Restreint UE/EU restricted’ level, an administrative  arrangement between the Security Directorate of the  European Commission and the agency was signed on  27 May 2011.  An internal document-management guide sets out  the conditions according to which documents need  to be registered, filed and saved using the agency’s  registration and filing systems. A special, intranet- based tool was developed to capture the information  needed to register and retrieve documents. In  addition, an incoming- and outgoing-mail procedure  was developed.  As regards the financial and administrative workflows,  in January 2015 ENISA adopted a SharePoint-based  application, ‘Paperless’, which routes documents  to staff involved in the preparation, review and  approval of all kinds of work-related documents  and transactions. All financial and administrative  workflows are well documented and all supporting  documents are uploaded and stored in ‘Paperless’,  including changes and comments by workflow actors.  Approved workflows are permanently stored and an  appropriate audit trail is produced.  Information and communication (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices  are in place for sharing information and monitoring  activities. These include regular Management  Team meetings during which issues relevant to  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 61  PART III. Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  performance, audit results and financial information  are discussed and actions are decided upon and  assigned. Regular financial reporting is available to  all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All engagements in new  projects are discussed during the implementation  of the annual work programme and decisions are  documented and communicated.  An external communication strategy is in place. ICT  security policies are in place for main systems and  subsystems and are described in procedures and  policies. Internal communication is also supported  through use of the intranet and through weekly staff  meetings within units. External communication and  dissemination procedures must be further developed  and communicated to staff accordingly.  The weekly staff meeting is used as a platform for  communication between all departments. Every week  staff members can share their work with the rest of  the agency.  Accounting and financial reporting (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are  documented in the agency’s internal control manual.  The preparation, implementation, monitoring and  reporting on budget implementation is centralised  in the Finance, Accounting and Procurement Section,  within the Stakeholders Relations and Administration  Department. The European Commission’s budget  and accounting management system, ABAC, is  the main tool used for financial management. It  is compliant with applicable financial regulatory  frameworks. The ABAC Assets module is used for  the management of ENISA’s inventory. Financial  management information produced by the agency,  including financial information provided in the annual  activity report, complies with applicable financial and  accounting  rules.  Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to  measure the performance and assess the impact of  the agency’s projects as provided for in its annual  work programmes. The general report and the annual  activity report are the tools used by the agency to  report on performance and impact. The feedback of  relevant stakeholders is taken into account.  Assessment of internal control systems (ICS 15)  Each year ENISA’s management assesses the  compliance of annual activities and performance  with the internal control systems in place, as part of  preparation of the annual activity report.  Internal audit capability (ICS 16)  The head of the Stakeholder Relations and  Administration Department assumes the internal  control coordination function. He is responsible for  implementing internal control systems in the agency  and liaising with the IAS of the European Commission.  Given the limited size of the agency, the role of  internal audit capability cannot be performed. Since  2005 the agency has relied on the IAS to carry out  internal audits. The IAS plays a key role in auditing  bodies of the European Union.  Internal control tasks performed in ENISA include  100 % of ex ante verifications, annual ex post controls,  hierarchical controls and outsourced engagements,  coordinated by the internal control coordination. The  role of internal control coordination was reinforced in  order to comply with all the recommendations issued  by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that  have the required knowledge and skills; (2) systems  and procedures designed and implemented to  manage the key risks effectively; and (3) no instances  of ineffective controls that have exposed the agency  to substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of  the continuous improvement of management  procedures. It includes taking into account any control  weaknesses reported and exceptions recorded.  62  IV  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 63  4.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The risk framework is used as a common means  of classifying and communicating risk across the  agency. It provides a common understanding and  language regarding risk, along with a structure for the  assessment, reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk  framework defines the categories, subcategories and  business risks applicable at the organisational level  for ENISA as a whole. It includes:  risk categories and subcategories;  risks specific to each category (business risks);  risk definition.  The agency’s operations are channelled through the  following activity areas that belong to administrative  functions.  Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with ENISA’s s programming document in terms of  operational and administrative activities.  Contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be insourced  by the agency. External agents are appointed  either through a procurement procedure or  through a call for expressions of interest for  funding related to the shared organisation of  events. Alternatively, in the case of working group  members, they may be chosen by means of a  selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its  administrative activities, the agency has carried out  the activities presented in the table on the next page.  4.  PART IV MANAGEMENT  ASSURANCE  64  Systemic process Activity Performance indicator 1 Follow up on auditor’s  comments and  recommendations  regarding administrative  practices and procedures  as they are implemented  in line with financial  regulation, implementing  rules and the Staff  Regulations.

Management assurance  4.2 EXCEPTIONS  In 2017 the agency recorded 31 exceptions.  Some of these 31 exceptions are ones that generated  interest payments to suppliers. The others are  administrative mistakes for which corrective  measures have been implemented to prevent the  repetition of these errors.  Twenty-five of them are under the materiality levels  and are minor administrative mistakes.  Of the six remaining, three a posteriori commitments  were reported, two were late payments to the  European Commission and the last was a purchase  order on which the amount exceeded the limit.  The information reported in Parts II and III stems  from the results of auditing by management and  auditors. These reports result from a systematic  analysis of the evidence available. This approach  provides sufficient guarantees as to the completeness  and reliability of the information reported, and results  in complete coverage of the budget delegated to the  Executive Director of ENISA.  66  V  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2017 67  5. PART I PART V DECLARATION OF  ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  In my capacity as authorising officer,  Declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view.

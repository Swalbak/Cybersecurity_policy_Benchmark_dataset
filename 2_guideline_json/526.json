Executive summary  User Education is key in cyber security. Our work for this report follows up on previous efforts and  suggested recommendations from 2014 and 2013. The first objective of this report is to identify gaps  between available training courses, certifications and NIS education needs with particular emphasis on  ePrivacy. The second objective is to suggest further actions based on the analysed needs of NIS  communities in Europe.  From the desktop research, the focus for most of the courses that included privacy appeared to be in the  computer science, computer security, information security, and cybercrime and cyber security subject  areas. However there were a number of courses that included privacy law (Information Technology,  Commercial, Corporate, Communications and Property), marketing and ethics. For several reasons, it may  be that privacy is an area that relatively lately is gathering attention (compared to Network and  Information Security). However this idea would require further future research to be proved. In terms of  existing Massive Open Online Courses- MOOCs, the offer around the subject of Privacy and Data  Protection is limited in general and there is a particular lack of MOOCs in the European context, both in  terms of delivery by European Universities/Institutes and also covering Privacy and Data Protection  Legislations and debates at European Levels. Furthermore, MOOCs and serious games are a path which is  being explored as a practical way to transfer knowledge, support learning, raise awareness, offer  professional training and unveil controversial issues and practices surrounding Privacy and Data Protection.  We developed a final section where we address recommendations to EU level organisations (e.g.  University Networks, Users’ Coalitions and Multipliers, Education institutions) and also Member State level  organisations (e.g. Education institutions, NGOs, think tanks, Government). Among those we mention:  1. Consider exploring serious games not only for raising awareness but also as a training ground for  first-responders and other professionals.  2. The report has highlighted that Privacy does not seem to feature in titles of undergraduate degree  courses and further research would be required to understand why.  3. Consider to invest in MOOCs with a NIS focus, in particular addressing the issue of privacy-by- design and European Legislation. We highlighted that some of the existing MOOCs are available in  national languages, this is clearly an advantage and a best practice. The report has highlighted that  there is scope for some specific MOOCs relating with issues currently debated at a European Level.  There is a general lack of Privacy and Data Protection MOOCs in the EU context, however this  delivery opportunity could be better exploited also via existing supported platforms (i.e.  OpenUpEd and EMMA).  4. Consider promoting the creation of multiple such quizzes using as basis the ENISA quiz in order to  raise awareness by participating in the spread of general quizzes and awareness month.  At the same time, ENISA has further developed a quiz to test user’s knowledge in Network and Information  Security1 and to disseminate good practices and knowledge from all its reports. The version 1.0 will use a  better gamified approach. A relevant addition to this year quiz are Cyber Security Month badges (following  the model from serious games) that are awarded upon completion of the quiz. The use of badges is also  1 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  06  one of the measures adopted for supporting the full completion of the quiz by a larger number of  participants.

Introduction  2.1 Description of the work  Previous reports2  published by the Agency on the broader subject of Network and Information Security  (NIS) Education emphasised the need to provide and support a continuous brokerage between public-  private stakeholders.  This report further contributes to the achievement of this objective and is the result  of this year’s interactions between experts and of a thorough desktop research and analysis. The report  discusses some of the trends and possible implementation solutions to current NIS issues with emphasis in  areas of work where ENISA has been active for a number of years and also where established  collaborations with the academic community exist. In particular, this report introduces data protection  concepts, places emphasis on the topic of ePrivacy3 and builds on some of the results contained in the  report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe4 published in 2014.  At the same time, following activities started in 2014, ENISA has further developed a quiz to test users’  knowledge in Network and Information Security and to disseminate good practices and knowledge. The  new quiz builds upon a pilot published in 2014 in conjunction with the European Cyber Security Month and  on the feedback received from the users who participated and completed the pilot.  This report describes  some of the results achieved with the pilot and offers a description of the new quiz.  2.1.1 Objectives  The first objective of this report is to identify gaps between available training courses, certifications and  NIS education needs with particular emphasis on ePrivacy. The second objective is to suggest further  actions based on the analysed needs of NIS communities in Europe.  ENISA will use its existing NIS  education communities to disseminate this work.  User Education is key in cyber security as shown by Digital Agenda Scoreboard and acknowledged in  many cyber security strategies of member states. Our work follows up every year on previous efforts  and suggested recommendations.  2.1.2 Target  Using an approach successfully tested in previous years, this report and the research work that underpins  it, has been prepared in collaboration with educators and for educators.  The primary target audience for  the report is represented by educators and policy-makers in the field of NIS education. The Agency’s NIS  education communities include not only IT administrators and professionals but a larger audience,  including training and education providers of multi-disciplinary backgrounds.  2 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/nis-in-education-reports  3 More about ePrivacy directive http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML  4 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education- programmes-in-europe  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/nis-in-education-reports http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  08  3. Policy review  3.1 EU Digital Agenda Member States’ scoreboards  Before presenting the findings of the research conducted in the area of NIS Education – with a focus on  ePrivacy – it is important to make a contextual introduction. The introduction in this paragraph and the  next (3.2) will support a better reading of the research and analysis work conducted for this report.  The Internet and Information Technologies have become a defining component of our societies and have  inevitably played a role in many processes of social change. Already in the seventies of the last century,  scholars raised attention to emerging forms of social arrangements broadly defined as Post-Modern  Society5, Knowledge Society or Information Society6. These are societies characterised by the production of  symbolic rather than material output, by an increased capacity to produce and process information and by  the ability to use information to take further decisions and introduce further reflexive changes. Other  authors, especially in the nineties of last century coined the term Network Society7 which emphasises – in  addition to the capacity to generate and use information – the pervasive role that networks have on social  organisation. One such network is clearly the Internet. While some of these concepts have also been  criticised in more recent years8, it remains true that Information Technologies, Mobile technologies and  the Internet, play nowadays a prominent role in social organisation. They provide positive aspects for  social change – think for example about the increase of communication possibilities – but also introduce  new challenges and inequalities, including those related with the skills and competencies that are  necessary to live and work in the knowledge society. For example it is not uncommon to hear about the  skills gap in the ICT industry in Europe, with the industry absorbing annually more personnel than the EU  education system can produce9. These changes also call for the need of new abilities, not just in term of  work or professional competencies but also for leisure and ordinary life more general. For instance –  touching upon issues recently addressed in ENISA reports - the advent of the Internet of Things and the  development of the smart home concept, will require home inhabitants to be able to master and control  new technologies and use mobile devices to control and manage their houses. At the same time these  changes require inhabitants to pay attention to security issues, for instance related with their ePrivacy and  with the ability to protect their behaviour and personal data10.  A useful concept to introduce at this point is that of e-skills. According to the document e-Skills for the 21st  Century: \"Overview, Key Definitions and Strategy\"11 published by the European Commission this term  encompasses ” a broad set of skills necessary in the modern workplace and digital economy.

They should be seen in the wider context of a core set of competences equipping all European  citizens for a knowledge-based society. These key competences should be provided in a lifelong learning  context”. Education and training are key instruments to provide these e-skills and bridge any eventual skill  gaps in citizens’ ability to live in the Knowledge Society. This report contributes to this perspective by  providing an initial map of training and education opportunities in Europe around the issues of ePrivacy.  The matching between the educational offer and the job offer should be further analysed and more agile  action is needed. Further to this issue, it is clear that in Europe and worldwide the digitalisation has  represented a disrupter for business as usual. All business sectors have taken on board new technologies  and new ways of organising work and have become part of the digital economy. For example, according to  the statistical data that can be consulted in the Digital Agenda12 scoreboard 2015, between 2001 and 2011  digitalisation accounted for 30% of GDP growth in the EU. The data shows that all EU Countries are moving  forward toward a digital economy and society, however they also show some differences of speed among  member states. Furthermore, for future development the digital single market package was introduced in  May 2015 and it will be evaluated against its three pillars: (1) better access for consumers and businesses  to digital goods and services across Europe; (2) creating the right conditions and a level playing field for  digital networks and innovative services to flourish; (3) maximising the growth potential of the digital  economy. In particular a composite index has been introduced for the measuring the results of the digital  agenda objectives: The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI).  The DESI is organised around six key dimensions: 1.Connectivity; 2.Human capital; 3. Use of internet  4.Integration of digital technology; 5. Digital public services; 6. Research and Development (R&D). We  recommend the use of the index to understand the progress of each country in the EU or as general  overview. In particular, according to the set roadmap the Human Capital dimension “measures the skills  needed to take advantage of the possibilities offered by a digital society. Such skills go from basic user skills  that enable individuals to interact online and consume digital goods and services, to advanced skills that  empower the workforce to take advantage of technology for enhanced productivity and economic growth”.  In this report we conduct an analysis of the existing training and education offer in terms of ePrivacy  curricula that offer opportunities to improve the Human Capital dimensions.  Privacy is a concept that needs to be approached holistically and with an interdisciplinary perspective as  the concept is in various ways tied with social, economic, legal, political and technical aspects13. The  multifaceted nature or Privacy clearly calls for an interdisciplinary approach to Privacy14 also in terms of  training and education. In the following pages various possibilities offered by Education bodies and actors  in Europe and across diverse disciplines are presented and discussed.  12 See http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/digital-economy-and-society-index-desi  13 Clarke, R.

Privacy is a “local” concept when considered, for example  according to the definition provided before, as the right for a personal space that an individual has.  However Information Technologies and the Internet make privacy also a global issue for citizens, at least  they need to think about their action also from a global perspective. When one considers for instance the  volume of personally identifiable information that is stored or shared online it is clear that this has led to  challenges when addressing the issues of privacy and security in a global landscape. Posting personal  information to Facebook, updating a LinkedIn profile or storing documents on a cloud service such as  Hubic/Dropbox are simple actions that many citizens do these days. These actions have obvious privacy  implications, who can see the information, where this is stored or what legislation regulates the  relationship between the user and the service provider. For example when an individual uses cloud  providers to store data, this data will be stored somewhere – likely in a country different from that of the  individual - and beside the privacy associated with the data in itself, also the location of this data and the  location of the service providers will become an issue. Considering further that there is a relevant  imbalance between “data processing entities, which determine what and how data is processed, and the  individuals whose data is at stake”15, this makes the issue even more relevant for individuals. It is therefore  more and more important to understand data privacy, legal or regulatory demands in this global  landscape.  “The UK and EU research reveals that concerns about privacy and the protection of personal data are  increasingly of importance to the public.” 16 In the current situation of individual’s digital data being stored  and shared, the question has to be asked “are citizens aware of what legislation protects them when it  comes to data privacy”. In a report written by the UK Information Commissioners Office for the European  Conference for Data Protection Authorities it states that “The public need to be empowered by DPAs to  understand what their rights are, how to use them and what they should expect from organisations.” 17  Perhaps a programme of education and awareness for individual’s explaining both what data they are  potentially sharing online with what they do on a day to day basis but also what are their rights to privacy  in this digital age will help shape how companies use personal data that is potentially available to them.  15 See a discussion in http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data- protection-by-design  16 Information Commissioners Office - Data protection rights: What the public want and what the public want from  Data Protection Authorities (2015)  https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431717/data-protection- rights-what-the-public-want-and-what-the-public-want-from-data-protection-authorities.pdf  17 See https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431717/data-protection-rights-what-the-public-want- and-what-the-public-want-from-data-protection-authorities.pdf  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  11  In light of these there are numerous (online) resources available that document and explain all of the  different international privacy provisions. These can be consulted by citizens, professionals or businesses  as they offer - on occasions - useful comparisons but also overviews and discussion about different  regulations and standards across the globe. While most of the existing resources are quite legalistic and  technical in nature, occasionally it is possible to find also simple and informative resources that ordinary  citizens can consults. A possible recommendation would be to try producing more of the simple and  informative tools for citizens, in this way easing the opportunities for individuals to gather knowledge and  be better informed about their own privacy. Below are some examples of existing resources that are  briefly discussed.  European Level  The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) works to ensure that European institutions and bodies  respect the right to privacy when they process personal data and develop new policies. The EDPS monitors  the processing of personal data in the EU administration and ensures compliance with the data protection  rules and advises the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on proposals for  new legislation and a wide range of other issues having an impact on data protection18. More information  regarding data protection legislation in Europe can be found on the website19. An interesting instrument  offered by the EDPS is a comprehensive glossary of terms20, which contains a number of terms relating to  the protection of personal data, especially in the context of the EU and its institutions. The glossary is  intended to support a better understanding of the activities of the EDPS and of data protection issues in a  more general context. This is a good example of an easy to use resources that can be consulted to get  relevant definitions and some contextualisation about relevant terms.  International Level  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a non-profit organization defending civil liberties in the digital  world and focuses much of its activities on privacy and freedom of expression21. On its website the EFF has  compiled a comprehensive and detailed list of international accords on privacy and data protection. The  accords serve as the foundation for national laws, policy frameworks, and international agreements  throughout the world22. This web page offers in particular a detailed list of links (URL) and it is of ease of  access and brings together in one single location the key relevant international accords.  On their website  under ‘Our Work’, although not relevant to everyone, they explain in detail a number of significant legal  18  See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Membersmission ;  19  See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Dataprotection/Legislation  20 See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Dataprotection/Glossary  21 See https://www.eff.org/about  22  See https://www.eff.org/issues/international-privacy-standards  Users have the same rights online as they have offline; they should be aware of their rights.  National Data Protection Authorities are there to support users.  “Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning them” - art 16, The  Treaty of Lisbon  https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Membersmission https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Dataprotection/Legislation https://www.eff.org/about https://www.eff.org/issues/international-privacy-standards  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  12  cases around keys issues of privacy. A section on the same page also lists a number of whitepapers23  published from 2005 up until 2015 discussing the challenges of data privacy.  Another organisation as a source for useful references is Privacy International, a registered UK charity that  campaigns at an international level on privacy issues, have produced in collaboration with academic  institutions across the globe, a number of reports in collaboration with academic institutions that  document global privacy issues24. While the reports might not be of immediate ease to consult for citizens,  Privacy International also hosts on its website a section called Privacy 10125 which contains a collection of  articles and multimedia material that, according to Privacy International tell “everything you need to know  about how these issues affect your life”.  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) hosts on its website an easy to consult table  that “presents a comparison of privacy concepts set out in some domestic and international privacy  regulations, laws, and guidelines in relation to Generally Accepted Privacy Principles”26. While the table  does not go in depth with the analysis, it is a useful resource as it offer a synthetic comparative view  according to “Generally Accepted Privacy Principles”.  Furthermore, a number of reports have been compiled by different international companies that detail  international agreements and national laws related to privacy. Baker Hostetler, a US law firm, produced  the 2015 International Compendium of Data Privacy Laws27 . This compendium is meant as a reference  guide that outlines the basic requirements in 40 countries. It is a well organised document were the  countries are listed alphabetically and for each country it is broken down in to different sections, these  sections are ‘Applicable Law’, ‘Data Protection Authority and Registration Requirements’, ‘Protected  Personal Data, ‘Data Collection and Processing’, ‘Data Transfer’, ‘Data Security’, ‘Breach Notification’,  ‘Other Considerations’ and ‘Enforcements and Penalties’. These sections are the same for all of the  countries in the compendium detailing relevant information for that country. The Applicable Law section is  self-explanatory in that the document lists the name of the legislation and where possible includes a URL  link (most cases governmental) as a further resource and in which year it was enacted. Similarly the Data  Protection Authority and Registration Requirements section names the authority for that country and  outlines the requirements of registration for data processing. The countries definition of personal data and  also what they see as data collection and processing as well as data transfer is given in the Protected  Personal Data, ‘Data Collection and Processing section.  The Data Security section includes information on  what data security measures are required (if any) and if a breach occurs. Finally the Enforcement and  Penalties section details the sanctions that can be imposed for any breach of the legislation.  DLA Piper produced a Data Protection Laws of the World Handbook28 and an interactive map detailing data  protection laws by country29. The Handbook “sets out an overview of the key privacy and data protection  23 See https://www.eff.org/wp  24  See https://privacyinternational.org/?q=reports  25 See https://privacyinternational.org/?q=privacy-101  26 See  http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/InformationTechnology/Resources/Privacy/GenerallyAcceptedPrivacyPrinciples/ Pages/InternationalPrivacyConcepts.aspx  27  See http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/International- Compendium-of-Data-Privacy-Laws.pdf  28 See http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/  29 See  http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/world-map-section  https://privacyinternational.org/?q=reports http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/InformationTechnology/Resources/Privacy/GenerallyAcceptedPrivacyPrinciples/Pages/InternationalPrivacyConcepts.aspx http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/InformationTechnology/Resources/Privacy/GenerallyAcceptedPrivacyPrinciples/Pages/InternationalPrivacyConcepts.aspx http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/International-Compendium-of-Data-Privacy-Laws.pdf http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/International-Compendium-of-Data-Privacy-Laws.pdf http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/world-map-section  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  13  laws and regulations across 77 different jurisdictions and offers a primer to businesses as they consider  this complex and increasingly important area of compliance”. However of particular interest for this report  is the interactive map30, which constitutes an easy to use and easy to consult instrument. Essentially the  map translates the findings of the Handbook in an interactive tool. The map offers the opportunity to  compare laws and regulations between countries and the comparison can be obtained around general  topics (i.e. Definitions, Authorities) but also around more specific and targeted topics (e.g. Privacy Offices,  Online Privacy).  While the list of resources provided here is not exhaustive but it does provide examples of some easy to  use tools and resources related with Privacy in a global perspective. There are a number of websites that  strongly support an individual’s right to privacy in today’s digital and global environment, the Electronic  Frontier Foundation and Privacy International are advocates of this and contribute to the latest research  around current and future data privacy issues. The handbook by DLA Piper and the compendium by Baker  Hostetler are useful reference materials to gain an understanding into what countries have in the way of  legislation and requirements to deal with data privacy. This gives some indication that a large number of  countries take an individual’s data privacy and organisations data processing responsibilities seriously.  In the following section (Section 4) of the report we offer now a preliminary analysis of existing training  opportunities around Privacy and Data Protection in the European context.  30 http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/world-map-section  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  14  4. Status of NIS courses in EU31  4.1 Privacy and data protection  Education and Training  We conducted a desktop research in English in order to identify what are the current offers in terms of  education and training within Member States. Some preliminary findings show however that in Europe the  situation appears fragmented and there is little reference to privacy and data protection in any course  syllabi  although a limited number of university degrees (mainly at postgraduate level) have “privacy”  explicitly mentioned in the title.  Primary education  As an example and an indication of what education around privacy is being taught and to investigate one  particular country in depth the education provision in the UK from the age of 14 was chosen as one of the  authors has knowledge of the different levels of the educational system. Schools in the UK can currently  offer GCSE Computing which children start at 14 and sit exams at 16 followed by AS and A Level Computing  which children study from the age of 16 to 18. The syllabus for both GCSE and GCE AS and A Level  Computing was reviewed for particular reference to privacy and data protection. Within the GCSE syllabus  written by OCR and published in September 201132 it was found that the word privacy appears only once in  the entire document. Privacy is discussed under a section entitled ‘Spiritual, moral, ethical, social,  legislative, economic and cultural issues’ and is placed into context with the explanation that this  ‘encourages candidates to explore the spiritual, moral, ethical, social, legislative, and cultural aspects of  the introduction of computer-based solutions to problems through a study of their effects on society’ and  data protection’. For the term data protection, there was no reference to this as a phrase, however  protection is mentioned and is in a section entitled Software which discuss computer security and states  candidates should be able ‘describe the purpose and use of common utility programs for computer  security (antivirus, spyware protection and firewalls)’.  With results for privacy and data protection low a widening of the review to include other terms was  looked into, security was chosen and again a small results. It would appear that the focus of the GCSE  syllabus as explained out in the ‘Aims and learning outcomes’ is on the functional aspects of computing  such as developing computer programs to solve problems. A review of the GCE AS and A Level syllabus33  written by AQA and published in February 2015 for the terms privacy and data protection found that there  was no reference to either, a review of the term security found a number of entries based around the  subject of encryption and in particular different types of encryption. As with the GCSE Computing syllabus  there is a strong focus on the functional aspects of computing such as programming but also networking  and databases are included. Although the results seem clear for the UK regarding the issues around  teaching privacy in the formal context of a syllabus further investigation should look at wider aspects that  include privacy, e.g. online safety that is currently taught in schools will cover certain aspects of privacy but  in a different context. There are clear limitations with only using one country and it would be a  31 Based on a desktop research  32 OCR.

University education  A desktop research was undertaken to identify the number of University courses but also the subject area  of University courses that included the term privacy in either the title or course description, information  available in English. From the desktop it was clear that within the UK using the Universities and Colleges  Admissions (UCAS) website34, which is a central organisation through which applications are processed for  entry to higher education, there are no undergraduate degrees (Bachelors) that have privacy in the title. A  further desktop research across a number of equivalent or similar European resources35 appears to reflect  the same findings. It should be noted that by no means was this an exhaustive search as each course listed  may have a module that discusses privacy or an aspect of privacy but that was not immediately obvious  and further detailed, investigation would take a significant amount of time which would be outside of this  projects timescale36.  There is however a significant shift in results when it comes to postgraduate programmes in that there are  a number of courses that have privacy in the title or make specific reference to it in a description of the  course (see below). It appears more common that privacy is included within other degrees (e.g.  information security, informatics). In the UK the Information Security and Privacy Masters from the  University of Cardiff was found to be the only course which included privacy in the title, however upon  further reading of the course descriptions/aims of the courses found it was clear that privacy was included  as an element within the degree. The focus for most of the courses that included privacy appeared to be in  the computer science, computer security, information security and cybercrime/cyber security subject area.  However there were a number of courses that included privacy law (Information Technology, Commercial,  Corporate, Communications and Property), marketing and ethics.  Table 1 with Examples:  TITLE UNIVERSITY AIM (FROM WEBSITE) URL  Information  Security &  Privacy  (MSc)37  University of  Cardiff (UK)  Appropriate security measures are an essential part of any  modern enterprise. A detailed understanding of the key  threats and the essential techniques for ensuring security,  privacy and trust are fundamental requirements for  successful information systems. Emerging software  deployment and use, through the use of data outsourcing  such as in Cloud computing and with the increasing use of  social media platforms, opens up significant security and  privacy issues which future IT professionals need to be aware  of. Professionals in this field are well placed for a wide variety  of employment opportunities.  http://course s.cardiff.ac.uk /postgraduat e/course/det ail/p148.html  34 See UCAS website https://www.ucas.com/  35 See http://www.prospects.ac.uk/search_courses_results.htm?t=srs&criteria.keyword=privacy&addfilter=2022  36 Some individual privacy courses are presented in the Network and Information Security courses in Europe Map  available here https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities  37 Offers on-campus IAPP Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP) certification exams to students in its  program.  http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html https://www.ucas.com/ http://www.prospects.ac.uk/search_courses_results.htm?t=srs&criteria.keyword=privacy&addfilter=2022 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://www.privacyassociation.org/certification  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  16  Computer  Security  (MSc)  Radboud  University  Nijmegen  (Netherlands)  Computer security is a topic of growing importance, as ICT  affects ever more aspects of our daily lives Businesses and  government rely on ICT to an ever larger degree. Both  assessing the security of existing ICT solutions and developing  more secure solutions for the future pose major scientific and  societal challenges.  This Master track covers a broad range of topics that is  important for computer security. This includes topics in  computer science (software, computer networks, and  hardware, esp. smart-cards and RFID), but also mathematical  aspects (cryptography and security protocols), as well as  organizational and management issues, legal aspects, and  societal issues (in particular privacy).  http://www.r u.nl/english/e dueducat/ma sters/computi ng-security/  Security and  Privacy  EIT Labs  The programme in Security and Privacy focuses on the study  of the design, development and evaluation of secure  computer systems, which are also capable of ensuring privacy  for future ICT systems. It follows a constructive security  approach to teach the very complex and challenging field of  information assurance. The aim is to provide students with an  understanding of the concepts and technologies for achieving  confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and privacy protection  for information processed across networks.  http://www. masterschool .eitictlabs.eu/ programmes/ sap/  One thing that came out of the desktop search and is worth mentioning is the opportunity for students at  postgraduate level to study in other European countries (via the European Institute of Technology – EIT),  for example there is a Master in Security and Privacy at the Saarland University in cooperation with  Technische Universität Berlin in Germany and University of Trento in Italy.  With regard to the outcomes of the desktop findings something else worth noting is that looking at the  titles and course descriptions it would appear that privacy is the smaller component rather than major  focus of the programme, e.g. Computer Security and Privacy in which computer security makes up a  significant part of the programme syllabus. The variety of postgraduate educational courses available that  have privacy in the title or mention privacy in the course description perhaps reflects the wider relevance  and application of privacy as a subject. As to why it would seem that privacy only appears in postgraduate  or doctoral courses may suggest an industry requirement, for example people looking to progress their  careers were privacy is key or there is a need for further and continuing research in this dynamic subject  area. Another possible factor may be that privacy is an area that relatively lately (compared to NIS) is  gathering attention. Hence is somehow natural that the introduction of privacy into these courses is still at  an early stage. However this suggestion would require further research to be proved. Within a University  undergraduate course where you would expect the inclusion of privacy in a given subject area such as  computing, computer security or law it would likely be present but the level of detail necessary to discover  that from simply browsing University course pages may not be sufficient. Another issue to bear in mind is  that simply searching for University degree titles may be somewhat flawed, from a marketing perspective  undergraduate course titles need to be attractive and capture the interest of potential students from the  age of 14 – 18 to influence their choice therefore offering a broader area and focused titles that students  clearly understand is necessary. It could simply be that privacy is not an attractive term to use in a degree  title or the fact that potential students may not have a clear understanding of what it means.  http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  17  4.1.1 Professional education, Training and Certifications  Beyond University and Higher Education, there are a number of opportunities to obtain training on Privacy  and Data protection, aimed both at professionals working in various sectors (e.g. healthcare, education), at  entrepreneurs and also for the general public. We conducted an initial survey of existing opportunities via  a desktop research based on English keywords. Some opportunities present in MS’ have been identified  and some of the most relevant examples are briefly discussed and analysed in this section.  Of particular interest for professionals working directly in the area of privacy (e.g. Data and Privacy  officers/managers) are the Privacy Training Classes and Online Training38 offered by the International  Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). The IAPP is a not-for-profit organization that helps define,  support and improve the privacy profession globally and is the largest information privacy organization in  the world39. The IAPP training is offered both face-to-face and online. While the IAPP operates globally,  face-to-face training is offered also across Member States. These trainings are also offered in the  perspective of preparing privacy professional in obtaining the IAPP privacy certifications: CIPP (for the area  of Law and Regulations), CIPM (for operations) and CIPT (for the technologies)40. Of particular interest for  the European context are the following courses:   Foundation41, which is the foundational training for preparation for the certificate tests.   Privacy in Technologies42 (CIPT) which covers essential aspect of privacy in relation with IT (e.g.  Online Privacy, Systems Applications and Cloud Computing).   Privacy Management43 (CIPM) with a focus on business operations and privacy.   European Privacy (CIPP/E) which cover essential aspect of for the European Context such as the  Data Protection Regulations and its compliance.  The certifications offered by the IAPP are also considered relevant in the European DPO44 position paper  Professional Standards for Data Protection Officers of the EU institutions and bodies working under  Regulation (EC) 45/200145, which states that “The possession of such a certification should be considered as  an asset by EU institutions/bodies when selecting their DPO”46.  38 See  https://privacyassociation.org/learn/training-classes  39 See https://privacyassociation.org/  40 See IAPP certification descriptions at https://privacyassociation.org/certify/programs  41 See https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/FoundationCourseOutline.pdf  42 See https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/CIPTCourseOutline.pdf  43 See https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course- outlines/PrivacyProgramManagementCourseOutline.pdf  44 See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/DPO  45 See http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf  46 See p. 5 of the position paper, available here  http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf  https://privacyassociation.org/learn/training-classes https://privacyassociation.org/ https://privacyassociation.org/certify/programs https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/FoundationCourseOutline.pdf https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/CIPTCourseOutline.pdf https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/PrivacyProgramManagementCourseOutline.pdf https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/PrivacyProgramManagementCourseOutline.pdf https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/DPO http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  18  The ECDL Foundation is also a relevant provider of NIS training and has some opportunities in the area of  Privacy and Data Protection, although not extensive. In the Roadmap for NIS education programmes in  Europe the ECDL module on IT Security47 was mentioned as a relevant training opportunity in the area  security for the general public. The IT Security module offers also a reasonable coverage of Privacy related  issues across the different areas being taught, from general concepts, to privacy online, to data protection.  Indeed one of the key module goals is described as follows: Understand the key concepts relating to the  importance of secure information and data, physical security, privacy and identity theft48. Recently ECDL  officially endorsed49 a module developed by the Irish Computer Society (ICS) entitled Data Protection  Essentials50. The module is described as “relevant to all employees who handle information about clients,  or members of the public who need a basic understanding of data protection rights and responsibilities”.  Core topics of the module include Fundamental definitions, Obligations, Individual rights and Regulation  and enforcement51. In particular, the ICS has the ambition to offer the module (in its E-learning version) to  over one million Irish ECDL students by 2017. Among the targeted audiences are a variety of profiles who  on a daily basis deal with personal data, such as Human Resources staff, Legal secretaries or Health Sector  Administrators52. ICS also offers a national certification ICS Data Protection Practitioner Certificate53.  In Italy, the AICA (Italian Association for Informatics and Automatic Calculus), offers an ECDL certification  called Diritto nell'ICT54 (ICT Law) aimed at professionals working in public administration, police, law firms,  education but also aimed a citizens and students in technical and law disciplines. The certification is  composed of two modules one of which is called Protection of Personal Data: Privacy and Security55, this  module has a strong focus on the evolution of the concept of privacy and the Italian privacy laws. AICA has  also recently signed an agreement with Federprivacy, the Italian national association of privacy  professionals56, where Federprivacy recognises “18 credits” related to the certificate of quality of their  members for those who complete the AICA module on Privacy and Data Protection.  In Poland, the Polish Information Processing Society (PTI) has developed a module called e-Urzednik (e- Clerk) for the use of ICTs in public administration. This module is ECDL endorsed. While the module offers a  general perspective of the use of ICTs it also contains a section on Privacy and Data Protection, covering  European and National Legislation (section 1.2.2 of the syllabus)57. In Germany, the ECDL national operator  has developed a module called Datenschutz58 (Data Protection) “aimed at employees who regularly handle  personal data and customer data. The initiative for the module springs in large part from the increasing  need for better training in data protection”.  47 See ECDL IT Security Module: http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/index.jsp?p=2928&n=2944  48 See http://www.ecdl.org/media/ITSecurity1.pdf  49 See http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5318  50 See http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php  51 See http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php  52 See full list here: http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php  53 See http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/practitioner-certificate.php  54 See http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict  55 See syllabus http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict/per-i-candidati/Modulo%201- Protezione%20Dati%20Personali%20Ver1-0.pdf  56 See website http://www.federprivacy.it/  57 See https://www.ecdl.pl/e-urzednik  58 See http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5320  http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/index.jsp?p=2928&n=2944 http://www.ecdl.org/media/ITSecurity1.pdf http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5318 http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/practitioner-certificate.php http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict/per-i-candidati/Modulo%201-Protezione%20Dati%20Personali%20Ver1-0.pdf http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict/per-i-candidati/Modulo%201-Protezione%20Dati%20Personali%20Ver1-0.pdf http://www.federprivacy.it/ https://www.ecdl.pl/e-urzednik http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5320  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  19  In the UK, the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) which is an independent authority set up to uphold  information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for  individuals gives advice and guidance to members of the public and organisations regarding the various  aspects of privacy and data protection. On the ICO website there are a number of training videos59 for  organisations that raise awareness about particular issues of data protection such data protection, privacy  notices and data breaches.  In the ICO’s latest report, Information Commissioner’s Annual Report and  Financial Statements 2014/1560, a number stated that for 2014/2015 they received just over 180,000  reports in relation to PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation) which was an 11% increase  on last year.  Also in the UK, the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, fosters links between industry, academia and  business to promote new thinking, education and knowledge sharing61. As an organisation within the  computing discipline they promote continuing professional development and one method is via a series of  respected IT qualifications and one such certification is Data Protection62, which they describe ”as a way to  broaden your understanding of the law and its practical application. It incorporates the latest changes and  updates outlined in the Data Protection Act of 1998 and the way it works with the Privacy and Electronic  Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003”63.  At national level, Data Protection Officers can also act as a catalyst for training opportunities by either  signalling relevant training to interested parties or by developing and offering training material. In Ireland,  the Data Protection Commissioner has developed guides and multimedia materials64. The Commissioner  website also points interested parties to training opportunities offered by third party organisations. In UK,  the Information Commissioner’s Office also has developed training and dissemination materials65 as well as  e-learning opportunities. Across the activities run by research projects funded by the European  Commission there have been examples of training related with Privacy. For instance the FP7 Project  PRIPARE (PReparing Industry to Privacy-by-design by supporting its Application in Research) held a Training  Workshop this year (9-10 March 2015) on Privacy and the methodologies developed by the project66. The  Horizon2020 Project STARTIFY7 aims at training young future ICT entrepreneurs in Europe. The project  organises training “academies” and of particular interest was the Trento Summer Academy aimed at those  with an entrepreneurial interest in Security and Privacy by Design67 .  Some considerations of the findings from this analysis are as follows:   Training activities outside University/Higher Education are often offered in conjunction with  specific certifications both internationally and at national levels;   National Computing Associations – at least in some of the cases considered here - have a  fundamental role in offering training opportunities on Privacy and Data Protection;  59 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/training-videos/  60 See https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431982/annual-report-2014-15.pdf  61 See http://www.bcs.org/category/5651  62See  http://certifications.bcs.org/category/15742  63 See http://certifications.bcs.org/upload/pdf/infosec-dp-syllabus.pdf  64 See http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Training-and-Awareness/805.htm  65 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/posters-stickers-and-e-learning/  66 See http://pripareproject.eu/events/privacy-training-workshop-3/  67 See http://www.startify7.eu/trento  https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/training-videos/ https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431982/annual-report-2014-15.pdf http://www.bcs.org/category/5651 http://certifications.bcs.org/category/15742 http://certifications.bcs.org/upload/pdf/infosec-dp-syllabus.pdf http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Training-and-Awareness/805.htm https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/posters-stickers-and-e-learning/ http://pripareproject.eu/events/privacy-training-workshop-3/ http://www.startify7.eu/trento  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  20   National Computing Associations often work in conjunction with other providers, e.g. ECDL, in  offering training and certifications (e.g. via endorsements);   Training activities offered via EU research project appears to focus on bridging the gap between  research and practical application of methodologies and techniques;   Certification are relevant for professionals (e.g. Data Protection Officer) but in certain countries  (e.g. UK) there are more than one;   National Data Protection Offices have a relevant role in producing and disseminating training  material.  4.1.2 MOOCs: Privacy & Data Protection  MOOC – Massive Open Online Courses are a new way of delivering online education68. MOOCs are often  similar to university courses in terms of content and breadth, but the delivery model, the assessment and  the peer collaboration is different from traditional University courses. They are often delivered by elite  universities from Europe and US and hence there is the promise for top level education for a wider  audience. According to existing research, MOOCs have seen so far a high level of enrolment coupled with a  low level of completion69. The debate is still open about the effectiveness of this delivery method in  comparison to traditional university teaching70 and a recent study highlighted the merits of this  approach71. Beside the wider debate around MOOCs, whose review is outside the scope if this report, it  must be signalled that the availability of material via online platforms offer also to least engaged  participants to opportunity to acquire relevant knowledge.  The ENISA report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe, published in October 2014, did  consider the current situation around MOOCs for Network and Information Security. The report stated  that MOOC could constitute an interesting approach for delivering NIS Education to large audiences. The  report also reviewed relevant best practices such as the Cybersecurity MOOC supported by the UK  Government via the FutureLearn platform, with the goal to “raise awareness of cyber security among a  mass audience as well as providing a high quality course which will make the subject accessible to non- specialist learners”. The report also highlighted the interest of the European Commission for this method  of delivering education, via for example the OpenUpEd platform72 supported by the Long Life Learning  Program. Recently another MOOC platform project – called EMMA - has been launched by the  Commission73. Although both OpenUpEd and EMMA do not have yet MOOCs in the NIS area. The  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe also did offer a specific recommendation about  MOOCs: Institutions should start to develop NIS MOOCs.  In addition, any future pan-European MOOC  initiatives should consider including ‘NIS for ALL’ modules within the programmes portfolio.  68 See for an exhaustive review https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13- 1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf  69 See for instance completion data from MIT and Stanford  http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped  70 See for example: https://www.edx.org/blog/comparing-effectiveness-learning-moocs  71  Colvin, K., Champaign, J., Liu, A., Zhou, Q., Fredericks, C., & Pritchard, D.

We conducted a recognition of the main MOOC platforms (edX, Coursera, FutureLearn, Udacity,  OpenUpEd, iversity, Canvas Network) as well as one from MSs national platforms (e.g. MiriadaX in Spain) in  order to map existing MOOCs offer in the area of Privacy and Data Protection74. The website MOOC-List  has also been used for this purpose75. We did a search for relevant keywords (e.g. privacy, surveillance,  confidentiality, data protection). The offer around the subject of Privacy and Data Protection is limited in  general and there is a particular lack of MOOCs in the European context, both in term of delivery by  European Universities/Institutes and also covering Privacy and Data Protection Legislations and debates at  European Levels. In total we identified eleven MOOCs on Privacy and/or Data Protection either as stand- alone courses or courses that embed at least one lecture related with privacy and data protection. Of  those taught in English, seven are (or were) delivered by US Universities and one each by an Australian  University and a European Research Institute. Interestingly there are two additional MOOCs loosely related  with Privacy and Data Protection taught in Spanish76 and French77 and delivered by European Institutes on  national MOOCs platforms.  Some conclusions of these findings are as follows:   There is a lack of offer around the subject of Privacy and Data protection (as a general keyword) in any  relevant MOOCs platform;   Some of the existing Courses overlap with the current debate around Mass Surveillance and the  NSA/Snowden Scandal;   Some courses are related with the issue of Big Data and Social Media and some with Data Protection in  the Health Sector;   OpenUpEd – the European Commission MOOC platform does not appear to have courses related with  privacy and data protection;   FutureLearn – the UK MOOC platform does not have courses on privacy and data protection;   At European Level, there are some limited examples of MOOCs on Privacy and Data Protection taught  in Member States languages other than English;   Most of the existing MOOCs are taught by US based Universities (in any case EU Universities are not  delivering on this subject in English);   Given that essentially all of the generalist offer (i.e. in English) comes from United States, the type of  content (in particular around legislations and technical requirements addressing legislation) does not  appear suitable for European Based Learners;   Privacy MOOCs are delivered within the scope of several different disciplines (Social Sciences, Law,  Computer Security, Business & Management, Health & Society, Political Science), however courses  with a NIS focus are largely underrepresented.  In general, the current situation could be much improved especially in terms of NIS education and we  develop in the recommendations’ section. A positive note is however the already noted existence of  74 These MOOC are available on map at https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities  75 See https://www.mooc-list.com/  76 See https://www.miriadax.net/web/derecho-redes-sociales  77 See https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/CNAM/01013/session01/about  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://www.mooc-list.com/ https://www.miriadax.net/web/derecho-redes-sociales https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/CNAM/01013/session01/about  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  22  MOOCs in languages other than English developed in Spain and France. Given that MOOCs are essentially  stand-alone courses which can be delivered over a short number of weeks and that are taken by students  which are other than traditional university students (often people which already have University degrees),  there is scope for developing more offer in the area, also covering the different aspects of Privacy and Data  Protection at social, economic, legal and technical levels.  In particular, with the increased interest in the subject of Privacy-by-Design (see for example the ENISA  report Privacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering78) and the engineering of privacy  in system design, it is surprising that there is no offer around this aimed at software developers and data  protection officers. Perhaps a more comprehensive MOOC offer would help bridging the “awareness and  e-illiteracy gaps” that the report Privacy and Data Protection by Design did identify as a major issue for the  diffusion of privacy-by-design best practice in the design and implementation of software systems.  Software developers and data protection officers may find in MOOCs the opportunity to acquire  knowledge about privacy-by-design, while studying at their own pace.  Likewise, in the European context there has been an intense debate around Privacy and Data Protection,  for instance with regard to recent initiative and events: the proposed right to Erasure, the EU Privacy Seal,  the reform of the Data Protection Legislation in Europe79, the mass-surveillance issues. These are all  aspects that could feature in MOOCs aimed at Law and Social/Business experts and scholars. Currently  however this offer appears non-existent for specialised areas.  Therefore, the recommendation offered by last year report around the idea  of having European Institutes  developing more MOOCs offer in the area of Cybersecurity, appears even more valid in the area of Privacy  and Data Protection. European Institutes could also take advantage of existing European platforms and  initiatives in this area such as the OpenUpEd and the EMMA platforms, both funded by the European  Commission. The recommendation from last year report also insisted on “for Beginners” MOOCs, aimed at  a wider audience, of which the already mentioned Cybersecurity MOOC sponsored by the UK government  and delivered on the FutureLearn platform is an example. The non-English MOOCs (in French and Spanish)  described before appear quite generalist an approach and this seems a step in the relevant direction. Of  the English taught courses, one is offered as an introduction to data privacy for non-experts in particular  aimed at educators (i.e. teachers) at all level80. However this is strongly shaped by the US context.  78 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/deciphering-the-landscape-for-privacy-by-design  79 See http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/review/index_en.htm  80 See https://www.canvas.net/browse/excelined/courses/data-privacy-get-schooled  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/deciphering-the-landscape-for-privacy-by-design http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/review/index_en.htm https://www.canvas.net/browse/excelined/courses/data-privacy-get-schooled  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  23  4.2 Other specialized topics: Short Review of Privacy and Data Protection Quizzes and  Serious Games  While traditionally games (both digital and offline) are seen as having only an entertaining goal,  researchers and industry have started to explore the fusion of game-based approaches and Information  Technologies for serious purposes81. Serious and educational games are these days used in a variety of  contexts and fields that include for example promotion of well-being and rehabilitation, general education  or training of professionals. The use of serious games and gamified approaches to learning constitutes an  interesting path to explore also in terms of NIS education and awareness 82 83 84 and the creation of the NIS  pilot quiz by ENISA - for the activities of the 2014 Cyber Security Month- also follows this perspective. The  2015 activities related with the quiz are described in the next section of this report. In this section of the  report instead are briefly reviewed some of the existing entertaining- gamified opportunities for learning  and training in the area of Privacy and Data Protection. The material presented in this section has been  collected via a desktop research, during the months of May-July 2015. The review offered here does not  pretend to be exhaustive, and the goal is to preliminary discuss some types of existing games, consider  what are the intended audiences of these games and highlight best practices emerging from the gamified  approach. More research work would eventually be required for an exhaustive and better conceptualised  review on the subject of serious gaming in Privacy and Data Protection.  Serious Game is the modern tool using the front end of a game (mainly to engage the player) and a back  end engine to gather useful data which could use for improving work process efficacy and expanding  knowledge base85.  Clark Abt discussion in this book Serious Games86: Reduced to its formal essence, a game is an activity  among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting  context. A more conventional definition would say that a game is a context with rules among adversaries  trying to win objectives. We are concerned with serious games in the sense that these games have an  explicit and carefully thought-out educational purpose and are not intended to be played primarily for  amusement.  Across the web it is not uncommon to find quizzes or serious games in which a gamified entertaining  activity is matched with goals of raising awareness, disseminate best practices and offering additional  81 See for an overview the following publication Susi, T., Johannesson, M. & Backlund, P.

It is for example not uncommon to find quizzes about Privacy  published by news and media outlets (e.g. newspapers) as a complement to articles87 or other media  initiative on the subject.  More relevant for the purpose of this brief review are examples of quizzes that have been developed by  public authorities and public initiatives with the intent to raise awareness about specific aspects of, for  example, current legislation, general practices and general attitudes of population. An example of a quiz  developed by a public authority is the Privacy and Data Protection Quiz88 of the UK Information  Commissioner’s Office. This quiz is an entertaining way of disseminating the results of an annual survey  which is conducted by the Information Officer on 1500 respondents: the quiz offers participants the  opportunity to see how their view compares to that of the general public. Another example of a quiz  developed by a public authority, is a quiz on data protection created by the Data Protection Office of the  Rehinland-Pfalz Land in Germany89. The quiz offers participants an opportunity to test their knowledge  with particular emphasis on “the Internet and social media such as Facebook”. The same public authority  also offers a quiz on data protection for young people90, where participants are asked to guide the quiz  character “Ben” in his digital life and helping him making choices that are relevant for his data protection  and privacy. Outside Europe a similar initiative has been presented by the Office of the Privacy  Commissioner in Canada with a quiz for young people91 and one for businesses92. In both these quizzes the  goal is to make each participant test “How well do you know your privacy rights?”. Another example comes  from the Klicksafe93 project co-funded by the European Union, which is an awareness campaign promoting  media literacy and adequate handling of the Internet and new media. The Klicksafe project offers a  number of quizzes (available only in German) relevant for young people online life, including a quiz offering  tips about Privacy and Data Protection94. The quiz comes with an appealing graphical interface and the use  of avatars to guide participants across real-life scenario situations and quiz questions.  87 See for example http://newsquiz.sciencemag.org/privacy/,  http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-do-you-know- about-data-privacy-1429499471, http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-01-29/conosci-privacy-web- 072247.shtml?sondaggi, http://www.journaldunet.com/questionnaire/fiche/14520/d/f/1/  88 See https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/privacy-and-data-protection-quiz/  89 See https://datenschutzquiz.hs-kl.de/  90 See http://www.verbraucherzentrale-rlp.de/datenschutz-quiz  91 See https://www.priv.gc.ca/youth-jeunes/quiz/index_e.asp  92 See https://www.priv.gc.ca/quiz/html_e.asp  93 See http://www.klicksafe.de/  94 See http://www.klicksafe.de/qz/quiz03/_project/  http://newsquiz.sciencemag.org/privacy/ http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-do-you-know-about-data-privacy-1429499471 http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-do-you-know-about-data-privacy-1429499471 http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-01-29/conosci-privacy-web-072247.shtml?sondaggi http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-01-29/conosci-privacy-web-072247.shtml?sondaggi https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/privacy-and-data-protection-quiz/ https://datenschutzquiz.hs-kl.de/ http://www.verbraucherzentrale-rlp.de/datenschutz-quiz https://www.priv.gc.ca/youth-jeunes/quiz/index_e.asp https://www.priv.gc.ca/quiz/html_e.asp http://www.klicksafe.de/ http://www.klicksafe.de/qz/quiz03/_project/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  25  Graph 1 – Screenshot of one of the questions composing the Klicksafe.de quiz on Data Protection  (Datenschutz)  These just mentioned are all examples that show the interest of public authorities in leveraging  entertaining quizzes for disseminating knowledge about ePrivacy. Quizzes are created for both young  people but also for other audiences, such as the general public or even companies. On the other side, the  use of quizzes confirms again the important role of Privacy and Data Protection Offices and other public  initiatives in offering training and learning opportunities.  Quizzes are a type of entertaining approach which offers learning opportunities leveraging a model of  sequential questions & answers. There are a few known examples of other types of games (both digital  and offline) related with Privacy and Data Protection aimed at schools, general audience and also  professionals. While the landscape of serious gaming about Privacy and Data Protection appears quite  fragmented and some of the existing games are now inactive or not used further, there are some relevant  examples which deserve to be mentioned in this report.  A first series of games are role-playing games in which players assume a fictional role, often that of  organisations who collect and deal with personal data. The scope of these role-playing games is to make  players understand how their personal data are collected, managed and used, often by very ruthless  organisations. A first example is the game Data Dealer95 a non-profit project and licensed under Creative  Commons in which “players take on the role of unscrupulous \"data dealers\", collect personal data all over  the internet, and learn how to turn this information into cash”96. Data Dealer is a browser game that  promotes awareness about how companies could collect personal data and the use they can make of this  data, and this is achieved by offering player the opportunity to take the role of these companies and  collect and exploit personal data. The game has received relevant news coverage and won the Most  Significant Impact Games for Change award in 201397.  95 See http://datadealer.com  96 See http://datadealer.com/about  97 See http://www.gamesforchange.org/2013/06/winners-of-the-g4c-awards-announced/  http://datadealer.com/ http://datadealer.com/about http://www.gamesforchange.org/2013/06/winners-of-the-g4c-awards-announced/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  26  Graph 2 – Screenshot of the Data Dealer educational game98  A non-digital game with a similar approach, was the Privacy Traders, a role-playing game originally  developed for the Internet Governance Forum Italy in 2011. The game was aimed at high school students  to be played in class. In this role-play game, students playing in groups could take the role of four or more  social networks and the scope of the game is to collect personal information of participants. The winner  will be who has collected the larger amount of personal data of other participants. In this way students  would learn that the key business practice of Social Network Sites is indeed the collection and exploitation  of personal data and that a Social Network account does not just come “for free” as users in fact trade in  their personal data. An interesting aspect of the Privacy Traders was that its content and gaming outcomes  were clearly linked with the work of the Italian Privacy Authority (so-called Garante Della Privacy), as the  game was accompanied by the explanation from an expert99 of how Privacy regulations in Italy would  apply to collection of personal data. Young people participating to the game received then also notions  about privacy regulations in Italy and how companies collecting private data should behave in accordance  to regulation. Similar to the previous two examples is the Privacy Game proposed by the Open  University100, again a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a fictional character and “make  decisions about what information characters might reveal to others and what they keep to themselves”. In  this case the role assumed is not that of a company collecting data, but that of a data subject (e.g. Internet  Shopper, Employer or even Hacker). The learning goal of the game is to highlight for players the value of  personal information as commodity. Another interesting example was the game Friend Inspector101. While  the above discussed role-playing games are general purpose in their application, Friend Inspector was a  game directly aimed at Facebook users and it had an explicit goal: raising awareness of Privacy in Social  Network Sites. Friend Inspector was a browser game that allowed participants to check who can see their  Facebook account and what information they have access to. The game also offered final  98 The game, including this image is released with a Creative Commons license Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC-BY-SA  3.0)  99 The expert presentation (in Italian) is also available as a Youtube video as part of the “game pack”, see  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9irSEkdQDfs  100 The game is hosted by the Centre for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy (CRISP)  101 See http://www.friend-inspector.org/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9irSEkdQDfs http://www.friend-inspector.org/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  27  recommendations on how players can improve their privacy on Facebook102. The game is now inactive due  to Facebook change of privacy policy as the end of April 2015. An additional example is a game created by  the Pan-EU Youth project103 using the game format play-decide104. These games offer young people the  opportunity to “Organise vivid debates with your friends at home or in the classroom and come up with a  policy on different issues on online responsibility and digital literacy”105. Specifically, the Privacy and Data  Protection play-decide game106, is a card game in which young people have the opportunity to debate  issues surrounding Privacy and is organised in three stages107, according to the play-decide format. The  first stage is the initial gathering of information supported by a set of cards containing information about  Privacy and Data Protection facts. The second step is a group discussion in which participants talk about  key themes of Privacy and Data Protection, again using a set of cards. The third and final stage is the  outcome of the game in which participants reach the formulation of policies on Privacy and Data  Protection. An interesting aspect of the game is that the policies formulated by playing the game can later  be shared on the Pan-EU Youth website. A last example of a game in the European Context is the \"The  earthquake data\"108 a card game for 2-4 people, which has been created for students of secondary schools  and vulnerable adults. The game is only available in Polish language under the original name of “Trzęsienie  danych” and has been created by the Panoptykon Foundation109. The game offers information to players  on how to better protect their privacy in everyday life. The game cards contain links to articles on the web  with additional information and practical advice.

The first is a game developed by the Canada’s  Centre for Digital and Media literacy, called Privacy Playground: The First Adventure of the Three  CyberPigs110. As stated on the teacher’s guide “The purpose of the game is to teach kids how to spot online  marketing strategies, protect their personal information and avoid online predators111”. Of particular  interest is that the game cater for a very young audience of pupils between 8-10 years of age. The game is  a graphical novel which readapts the story of the three little pigs and guides players trough scenarios and  quiz related with Privacy and the protection of their personal data. The second game is called Privacy and  Security Challenge112 and was created by The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology's (ONC) Office of the Chief Privacy Officer (OCPO) in the United States. This example is  different from the others discussed so-far as the game is used for training in first response situations, i.e.  situations that are dangerous or difficult to conduct in reality.  Specifically the game aims at training health  care provider professionals (e.g. nurses) to respond to Privacy and security challenges faced in a typical  small medical practice. This is a relevant approach leveraging serious games for training that clearly go  beyond raising awareness only. This is the only example identified in this short review that leverages this  approach to training professionals.  In conclusion, serious games are a path which is being explored as a way to transfer knowledge, support  learning, raise awareness, offer professional training and unveil controversial issues and practices  surrounding Privacy and Data Protection.  There are some relevant points to consider in conclusion of this  section. The landscape of serious gaming appear quite fragmented and some of the existing games, while  interesting, do seem now abandoned (e.g. Privacy Traders) or obsolete due to various reasons (e.g. Friend  Inspector, due to Facebook change of Privacy Policy). Of relevance of the gamified approach is the use of  gaming to reach a varied audience from very young people (e.g. pupils, high school students), to citizens,  to professionals. This shows how gamified approaches are flexible tools for dissemination, learning and  awareness at different levels and the recommendation is to continue exploring serious gaming in the area  of Privacy and Data Protection. Another interesting aspect to consider is that a good number of the games  discussed here is released under Creative Commons licenses113, this is a best practice that can support  wider re-play and in some cases further adaptations of the games. In particular non-digital games often  come with downloadable game “packs”, so that interest parties (e.g. schools) can download the game  material and instructions and print it for their own play. It is also relevant to note that there is interest in  110 See http://mediasmarts.ca/game/privacy-playground-first-adventure-three-cyberpigs  111 See http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/pdfs/games/privacy_playground_guide_2015.pdf  112 See http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/privacy-security-training-games  113 See http://creativecommons.org/  http://mediasmarts.ca/game/privacy-playground-first-adventure-three-cyberpigs http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/pdfs/games/privacy_playground_guide_2015.pdf http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/privacy-security-training-games http://creativecommons.org/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  29  developing serious games that are non-digital/offline (e.g. board, card games) that can be played  collectively and in person by participants. This is an important best practice. Indeed, digital games  (including quizzes) are often single-player114 and therefore less able to support peer-learning and critical  discussion among players and between players and facilitators (e.g. teachers). Finally a further possible  recommendations is that games should also be accompanied by processes of evaluation of their results.  This would be relevant in order to verify how effective the gamified approach is for learning or training and  what could be done better in Privacy and Data Protection Games.  114 To this is an exception Open University Privacy Game that supports both single and multiplayer games.

Educational tools  5.1 The new version of the Education map115  A database has been created by ENISA with information on Network and Information Security courses in  Europe in the context of a close partnership with WG3 of NIS Platform. It was launched in October 2014  with the context of the advocacy campaign European Cyber Security Month. The database lists a number  of available courses and certification programmes linked to Network and Information Security, privacy and  data protection.  ENISA is working to enhance the database and the 2015 version contains relevant improvements among  which it is important to mention:  improvements to the search functionality, a better display of the  information which will ease users in consulting the available material and finally a better promotion of the  database towards education providers that will facilitate and support them to encode and add their offers  to the database. Regarding metrics and current size of this tool:  after +1 year of existence this map  displays 22 countries in Europe and includes more than 400 entries. ENISA encourages Higher Education  and Long Life Learning providers to include their offer in this map.  Graph 5- existing entries on the map year 1  5.2 The NIS quiz from pilot to version 1.0  In 2014, as part of the European Cyber Security Month116 and its NIS eEducation activities, ENISA has  developed a NIS self-assessment pilot quiz. The pilot quiz has originally been created with several goals in  mind. The first one is to disseminate best practices and notions around NIS – with particular emphasis on  general security and privacy - to a broad non-specialist audience. The model of the questions chosen for  the quiz has been that of a scenario, in which a narrative-short story is presented to participants and then  three options are offered as possible answers to the scenario problem. Participants are then asked to  select one of the options. Upon selection of an answer – whether correct or not – an explanation/feedback  is offered to participants on why the answer is correct or not within the context of the scenario. In addition  to the textual feedback, additional links to relevant material to consult are also offered. In this way  participants can with a single click, access relevant report and additional content. In graph 6 there is an  example of a question taken from the 2014 pilot quiz: a scenario is presented to participants – in the  example in graph 6 a scenario about botnets – then three options/answers are presented.  115 See https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities  116 See https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  31  In the example the participant has selected an incorrect answer and then there is the  explanation/feedback about the answer with a pointer to an ENISA report for more information.  Graph 6 – Example of a scenario and the feedback on an incorrect answer from the pilot quiz.  A second goal of the quiz was to combine together an entertaining-gamified activity with a serious  educational goal: offer via a quiz-game an opportunity for participants to familiarise themselves with some  of the key themes of NIS Education and some of the recommendations contained in a number of ENISA  reports. In this way the quiz also served a third goal: better disseminate part of the ENISA work to citizens  and other interested stakeholders. In particular several questions of the pilot quiz have been created using  a number of ENISA reports and recommendations – mainly those aimed at end users – and references to  reports are offered in the feedback to each answer. In addition, at the end of the quiz a list of all the  reports used for building the quiz is presented to participants (see graph 7).  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  32  Graph 7 – List of ENISA report presented at the end of the quiz to participants on which the pilot quiz is  based  The pilot quiz has received positive feedback from citizens, experts and public authorities. Most  importantly the quiz was completed by a good number of participants (see data in the next paragraph)  across the world. Therefore building on the encouraging results of the pilot, this year ENISA has continued  working on the idea of a quiz as an important approach to disseminate NIS practices to a wider audience of  non-experts. The approach adopted for the 2015 edition of the quiz, considers: overcoming shortcomings  observed in the test-pilot as well, make improvements in the areas of content and usability and keep intact  aspects of the pilot that worked well in particular the format of the question and the dissemination of  ENISA material. Therefore the goal for this year work is to make the pilot evolve into a more stable and  solid quiz, with additional questions, better scenarios, graphical and general use improvements. In the  following paragraphs some reflections are offered on the results of last year work and there is a  presentation of key results from last edition of the quiz. There is also a discussion about how these results  have informed the new quiz this year. There is then a discussion of the key aspects of the new version of  the quiz.  5.2.1 Results achieved with the pilot quiz in 2014  In this section of the report are present some data and results of the 2014 pilot quiz. Both numerical data  related with participation and examples of the textual feedback received from participants are presented.  These data have been taken in account to inform decisions for this year work on the quiz.  The pilot version of the quiz was launched by ENISA as part of the European Cyber Security Month  activities on 23 October 2014. In term of overall participation the quiz page has been visited by almost  40.000 (thousands) users and the quiz was completed (from start to finish) by 1400 participants. The quiz  has also been completed by participants from 81 countries, with clear prevalence of EU countries – with  some exceptions (United States and India also appear in the list of top 10 countries, perhaps due to the  quiz being in English). In the top 10 list of countries we have Belgium, United Kingdom, Greece,  Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Spain and Estonia. While the number of participants that completed the quiz  and the spread across the globe are very encouraging, there is also a gap between the number of unique  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  33  visitors to the quiz (almost 40 thousands) and the number of those who completed it. This is an aspect  which will be taken in account this year and improvements are planned to increase the number of people  completing the quiz from start to finish. In graph 8 is displayed the breakdown of participation across the  period of the Cyber Security Month (October – November) and the remaining months up to June 2015,  when the work on the new version of the quiz started.  Graph 8- Monthly breakdown of participants – with emphasis on the Cybersecurity Month period.  During last year piloting work, particular emphasis was placed on offering participants the opportunity to  give impressions, comments and feedback to ENISA. The goal was to collect material that could be used for  making improvements for future editions of the quiz and also listen to participant ideas. An important  aspect of this was the initial self-assessment of participants. ENISA together with its experts agreed that  the quiz should be a simple way to measure some of the participants’ skills related to NIS but should also  offer a way for participants to identify knowledge and skills gaps and offer information on how to bridge  these gaps. The quiz came with diverse levels of difficulties and at the beginning participants were asked to  self-assess their level of knowledge, according to three different levels  - beginner, intermediate, advanced  and do not know117 - and where, upon their selection, thus directed to the appropriate level quiz.  Graph 9 – Form of the Preliminary self-assessment for participants  In graph 10 it is possible to see the breakdown of participants in terms their initial self-assessment. The  quiz has been completed most at the advanced level (503 completion) and less at the beginner level (429  completion) although the variation between the two is not enormous. In perspective this tells probably  that more work needs to be done to increase participation and engagement for non-expert, as they were  indeed the main target audience for the 2014 pilot quiz. For this year edition the key focus will indeed be  117 The selection of the “do not know” option would lead participants to the beginner version of the quiz.  399 404  597  0  200  400  600  800  Oct-14 Nov-14 Dec 2014 - Jun 2015  Quiz Completion in the Cybersecurity  Month and after  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  34  on the beginner and intermediate levels of the quiz. A further consideration made during the discussion of  the experts is that probably the label “beginner” is not the most appropriate as it might point to  weaknesses of participants and for this year this will be replaced with more neutral labels (e.g. “initial  level” or “level 1”). An additional feature of the pilot quiz was also that upon good results in a lower level  of the quiz (e.g. beginner) the platform would encourage participants to take the next advanced level (e.g.  intermediate), thus encouraging participants to learn more and have a better sense of their knowledge.  This feature could also have had some impact on the increase rate in completion leaning toward higher  levels, however analytics measures for this aspect are not available.  Graph 10 - Breakdown of participants based on their self-assessment  In addition to the self-assessment, the pilot quiz did offer participants opportunities to provide textual  feedback to ENISA, both in term of their expectations about the quiz (prior to start the quiz) and at the end  as a general feedback about the engagement with the quiz asking what could be improved and what they  enjoyed about the quiz. The purpose for asking participants their comments was to gather evidences about  the relevance of this initiative directly from participants and have material to be used for shaping and  improving future editions of the quiz. In graph 11 is presented the feedback from appearing at the end of  the pilot quiz.

Some examples of  what the participants did like about the quiz:  It was reassuring and the responses after each question explained the answers simply.  I have learnt a little bit more about security. Now I assess the links that will help me to improve my  knowledge about security in the internet.  On the questions that I got wrong, the correct answer had good feedback with i.e. links to articles that  explain it all in (more) detail.  These comments point to relevant strengths of the quiz, in particular the opportunity for participants to  learn more about security and the emphasis placed on detailed feedback and additional material to  consult. As already discussed, these elements will remain part of the new version of the quiz.  The following are suggestions about what could be improved and done better:  I think some of the questions were a bit ambiguous - it is difficult from the description to pick one  particularly correct answer when more than one of the actions may be reasonable. Appreciate this is  difficult to get right with this sort of quiz.  Some of the answers should be explained a little bit more as to understand the right idea behind them.  Language, I think the different scenarios could be described in a simpler language, therefor enabling  easier access to the non-native English speakers.  These feedback points to some of the weaknesses of the quiz, and in particular the wording of scenarios  and answers which on occasion could be simplified hence offering a better understanding to participants.  Also these considerations have been taken in account for this year work.  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  36  5.2.2 Usability and other issues in the pilot version  The pilot version of the quiz has been reviewed both by usability experts and by the experts collaborating  with ENISA in term of its usability and graphical appealing and several improvements have been discussed  and planned for the new version in 2015, also taking in account the users’ feedback. Recommendations  output of this review include:   The introduction of multimedia material (rather than having just a textual quiz) where possible, in  order to: improve the general and lasting engagement with the quiz, offer better explanations to  participants, support participants across the whole breadth of the quiz and increase the number of  full completion of the quiz.   Better explanation of why a certain answer is correct within a scenario. Since the questions are  based on a narrative, answers are contextual to the narrative itself. One of the recommendations  received relates with the idea of offering better explanations as to why a specific answer is indeed  correct in the scenario, and not necessarily in general.   Increased number of quizzes. The pilot version was developed as a single quiz covering several NIS  areas. A relevant addition, already discussed also during the work of the experts both in 2014 and  2015 is to have quizzes organised around different topics (e.g. privacy or security etc.). Hence to  have multiple quizzes with participants being able to take them individually but also together for  instance with the award of the badge based on aggregated scores from the diverse quizzes.   To improve the gamification elements of the quiz. In the pilot version, these were limited to the  generation of a profile and score at the end of the quiz. A relevant addition to this year quiz are  Cyber Security Month badges that are awarded upon completion of the quiz and that participant  can share on Social Media. The use of badges is also one of the measures adopted for supporting  the full completion of the quiz by a larger number of participants.  Generally the idea is to: offer better textual descriptions, streamline the number of quizzes across diverse  subjects, improve the gamification aspects to create better engagement and add multimedia material to  better support the completion of the quizzes by participants. In the next section there is a discussion of  how these recommendations have shaped the new version of the quiz.  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  37  5.2.3 Version 1.0 of the Quiz  The general concepts and organisation of the 2015 quiz will remain similar to the original 2014 pilot (see  Graph 12). With some relevant improvements that are briefly presented in this section. The participant will  choose the difficulty level then select the choice between topics: Privacy or General security. Furthermore  they will reply to 10 scenarios by choosing an answer from the provided ones. Each answer will come with  an explanation and at the end a Cyber Security Month badge.  Graph 12 – Structure of the 2015 quiz  The questions will be presented to participants as scenarios/narratives with 3 options/answers among  which to choose. Similarly to the 2014 edition each answer will be accompanied with specific feedback and  additional material to consult. This approach has indeed proven successful for disseminating best practices  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  38  and for driving engagement. The feedbacks received from participants about this format have also been  encouraging. Relevant changes introduced this year in comparison to last year pilot are the following:   For this year there will be two quizzes rather than just one: one quiz will be devoted to general  security and the other one to privacy. This will be achieved by splitting the 2014 pilot quiz  questions (i.e. dividing those related with privacy from those related with security) and adding  additional questions to sum up to 10 questions for each quiz. In this way last year work will be  capitalised and extended, offering more content alongside the content already produced.   In this edition there will be two difficulties levels for the quiz, those that in the early pilot  corresponded to beginner and intermediate levels. The reason for this choice is the will to engage  with the quiz mainly the general audience rather than security experts, hence more effort is  devoted to develop a quiz for this specific audience which is the one that could receive additional  benefits from the quiz.   The Usability of the quiz has been substantially improved with: (1) a virtual avatar acting as a “guru  guide” through the quiz, in order to make the quiz more personal and increase the engagement,  (1) one short explanatory video in order to increase engagement and offer better explanations of  the goals and achievements of the quiz.   Wording of 2014 scenarios, answers and feedbacks has been simplified were possible. For new  questions developed in 2015 wording has been kept simpler in comparison to 2014 questions. In  this way the key feedback received from users will be addressed.   The version 1.0 will use a better gamified approach. Among other things this year there has been  the introduction of Cyber Security Month Badges, in order to offer a better engagement, reward  and opportunity to share results on Social Media.

Conclusion  This report has provided an initial mapping and a discussion about existing education and training  opportunities with particular focus on ePrivacy and has connected these with the wider offer of NIS  education discussed in the previous 2014 report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe.  What has emerged from this analysis are strengths and weaknesses in the current landscape, but most  importantly several relevant best practices have been identified and possible improvements have been  signalled. What follows is a list of initial recommendations (both at EU and MS’ levels) based on the  results of the report, EU level organisations (e.g. University Networks, Users’ Coalitions and  Multipliers, Education institutions); Member State level organisations (e.g. Education institutions,  NGOs, think tanks, Governments).  6.1 For European level stakeholders   Consider to analyse the quantity of the offer of courses in MSs.   Consider to conduct further research to better understand how Privacy subjects are embedded in  undergraduate degrees. The report has highlighted that Privacy does not seem to feature in titles  of undergraduate degree courses and further research would be required to understand why (e.g.  if it is for marketing purposes or if there is a skill gap in current offer).   Consider to invest in MOOCs on Privacy and Data Protection, covering both basic and advanced  topics, for non-expert and expert audiences. There is a general lack of Privacy and Data Protection  MOOCs in the EU context, however this delivery opportunity could be better exploited also via  existing supported platforms (i.e. OpenUpEd and EMMA).   Consider to invest in MOOCs with a NIS focus, in particular addressing the issue of privacy-by- design and European Legislation. The report has highlighted that there is scope for some specific  MOOCs relating with issues currently debated at a European Level.   Consider to further explore serious games as a path to reach a varied audience of both experts and  non-experts. In particular, serious games should support re-playability and ideally be distributed  with non-restrictive licenses in order to support adaptation and wider reuse in educational settings  and by the public more generally. Consider investing resources also on the evaluation of results  achieved with serious games.   Consider exploring serious gaming not only for raising awareness but also as a training ground for  first-responders and other professionals. In the European context, serious games around Privacy  and Data Protection focuses extensively on education and awareness. While these are  fundamental aspects, there is also scope for using serious games for training first response  professionals.  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  40  6.2 For Member State level   Consider to create synergies with other countries in terms of transfer of best practices.   Consider to create metrics and assess the progress and the offer from the education providers.   Games available in one of the MS language could be translated to other languages, for a wider  impact, when applicable. The use of Creative Commons licenses could support this.   The report has highlighted that some of the existing MOOC are available in National Languages,  this is clearly an advantage and a good practice. Other MSs could consider develop Privacy and  Data Protection MOOCs in the respective MS’ languages.   Should consider to explore the offer of serious games and enrich it.   Consider to join ENISA’s project quiz in order to raise awareness by participating in the spread of  general quizzes and awareness month.

Executive summary  User Education is key in cyber security. Our work for this report follows up on previous efforts and  suggested recommendations from 2014 and 2013. The first objective of this report is to identify gaps  between available training courses, certifications and NIS education needs with particular emphasis on  ePrivacy. The second objective is to suggest further actions based on the analysed needs of NIS  communities in Europe.  From the desktop research, the focus for most of the courses that included privacy appeared to be in the  computer science, computer security, information security, and cybercrime and cyber security subject  areas. However there were a number of courses that included privacy law (Information Technology,  Commercial, Corporate, Communications and Property), marketing and ethics. For several reasons, it may  be that privacy is an area that relatively lately is gathering attention (compared to Network and  Information Security). However this idea would require further future research to be proved. In terms of  existing Massive Open Online Courses- MOOCs, the offer around the subject of Privacy and Data  Protection is limited in general and there is a particular lack of MOOCs in the European context, both in  terms of delivery by European Universities/Institutes and also covering Privacy and Data Protection  Legislations and debates at European Levels. Furthermore, MOOCs and serious games are a path which is  being explored as a practical way to transfer knowledge, support learning, raise awareness, offer  professional training and unveil controversial issues and practices surrounding Privacy and Data Protection.  We developed a final section where we address recommendations to EU level organisations (e.g.  University Networks, Users’ Coalitions and Multipliers, Education institutions) and also Member State level  organisations (e.g. Education institutions, NGOs, think tanks, Government). Among those we mention:  1. Consider exploring serious games not only for raising awareness but also as a training ground for  first-responders and other professionals.  2. The report has highlighted that Privacy does not seem to feature in titles of undergraduate degree  courses and further research would be required to understand why.  3. Consider to invest in MOOCs with a NIS focus, in particular addressing the issue of privacy-by- design and European Legislation. We highlighted that some of the existing MOOCs are available in  national languages, this is clearly an advantage and a best practice. The report has highlighted that  there is scope for some specific MOOCs relating with issues currently debated at a European Level.  There is a general lack of Privacy and Data Protection MOOCs in the EU context, however this  delivery opportunity could be better exploited also via existing supported platforms (i.e.  OpenUpEd and EMMA).  4. Consider promoting the creation of multiple such quizzes using as basis the ENISA quiz in order to  raise awareness by participating in the spread of general quizzes and awareness month.  At the same time, ENISA has further developed a quiz to test user’s knowledge in Network and Information  Security1 and to disseminate good practices and knowledge from all its reports. The version 1.0 will use a  better gamified approach. A relevant addition to this year quiz are Cyber Security Month badges (following  the model from serious games) that are awarded upon completion of the quiz. The use of badges is also  1 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/quiz-demonstration  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  06  one of the measures adopted for supporting the full completion of the quiz by a larger number of  participants.

Introduction  2.1 Description of the work  Previous reports2  published by the Agency on the broader subject of Network and Information Security  (NIS) Education emphasised the need to provide and support a continuous brokerage between public-  private stakeholders.  This report further contributes to the achievement of this objective and is the result  of this year’s interactions between experts and of a thorough desktop research and analysis. The report  discusses some of the trends and possible implementation solutions to current NIS issues with emphasis in  areas of work where ENISA has been active for a number of years and also where established  collaborations with the academic community exist. In particular, this report introduces data protection  concepts, places emphasis on the topic of ePrivacy3 and builds on some of the results contained in the  report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe4 published in 2014.  At the same time, following activities started in 2014, ENISA has further developed a quiz to test users’  knowledge in Network and Information Security and to disseminate good practices and knowledge. The  new quiz builds upon a pilot published in 2014 in conjunction with the European Cyber Security Month and  on the feedback received from the users who participated and completed the pilot.  This report describes  some of the results achieved with the pilot and offers a description of the new quiz.  2.1.1 Objectives  The first objective of this report is to identify gaps between available training courses, certifications and  NIS education needs with particular emphasis on ePrivacy. The second objective is to suggest further  actions based on the analysed needs of NIS communities in Europe.  ENISA will use its existing NIS  education communities to disseminate this work.  User Education is key in cyber security as shown by Digital Agenda Scoreboard and acknowledged in  many cyber security strategies of member states. Our work follows up every year on previous efforts  and suggested recommendations.  2.1.2 Target  Using an approach successfully tested in previous years, this report and the research work that underpins  it, has been prepared in collaboration with educators and for educators.  The primary target audience for  the report is represented by educators and policy-makers in the field of NIS education. The Agency’s NIS  education communities include not only IT administrators and professionals but a larger audience,  including training and education providers of multi-disciplinary backgrounds.  2 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/nis-in-education-reports  3 More about ePrivacy directive http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML  4 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education- programmes-in-europe  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/nis-in-education-reports http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:EN:HTML http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  08  3. Policy review  3.1 EU Digital Agenda Member States’ scoreboards  Before presenting the findings of the research conducted in the area of NIS Education – with a focus on  ePrivacy – it is important to make a contextual introduction. The introduction in this paragraph and the  next (3.2) will support a better reading of the research and analysis work conducted for this report.  The Internet and Information Technologies have become a defining component of our societies and have  inevitably played a role in many processes of social change. Already in the seventies of the last century,  scholars raised attention to emerging forms of social arrangements broadly defined as Post-Modern  Society5, Knowledge Society or Information Society6. These are societies characterised by the production of  symbolic rather than material output, by an increased capacity to produce and process information and by  the ability to use information to take further decisions and introduce further reflexive changes. Other  authors, especially in the nineties of last century coined the term Network Society7 which emphasises – in  addition to the capacity to generate and use information – the pervasive role that networks have on social  organisation. One such network is clearly the Internet. While some of these concepts have also been  criticised in more recent years8, it remains true that Information Technologies, Mobile technologies and  the Internet, play nowadays a prominent role in social organisation. They provide positive aspects for  social change – think for example about the increase of communication possibilities – but also introduce  new challenges and inequalities, including those related with the skills and competencies that are  necessary to live and work in the knowledge society. For example it is not uncommon to hear about the  skills gap in the ICT industry in Europe, with the industry absorbing annually more personnel than the EU  education system can produce9. These changes also call for the need of new abilities, not just in term of  work or professional competencies but also for leisure and ordinary life more general. For instance –  touching upon issues recently addressed in ENISA reports - the advent of the Internet of Things and the  development of the smart home concept, will require home inhabitants to be able to master and control  new technologies and use mobile devices to control and manage their houses. At the same time these  changes require inhabitants to pay attention to security issues, for instance related with their ePrivacy and  with the ability to protect their behaviour and personal data10.  A useful concept to introduce at this point is that of e-skills. According to the document e-Skills for the 21st  Century: \"Overview, Key Definitions and Strategy\"11 published by the European Commission this term  encompasses ” a broad set of skills necessary in the modern workplace and digital economy.

They should be seen in the wider context of a core set of competences equipping all European  citizens for a knowledge-based society. These key competences should be provided in a lifelong learning  context”. Education and training are key instruments to provide these e-skills and bridge any eventual skill  gaps in citizens’ ability to live in the Knowledge Society. This report contributes to this perspective by  providing an initial map of training and education opportunities in Europe around the issues of ePrivacy.  The matching between the educational offer and the job offer should be further analysed and more agile  action is needed. Further to this issue, it is clear that in Europe and worldwide the digitalisation has  represented a disrupter for business as usual. All business sectors have taken on board new technologies  and new ways of organising work and have become part of the digital economy. For example, according to  the statistical data that can be consulted in the Digital Agenda12 scoreboard 2015, between 2001 and 2011  digitalisation accounted for 30% of GDP growth in the EU. The data shows that all EU Countries are moving  forward toward a digital economy and society, however they also show some differences of speed among  member states. Furthermore, for future development the digital single market package was introduced in  May 2015 and it will be evaluated against its three pillars: (1) better access for consumers and businesses  to digital goods and services across Europe; (2) creating the right conditions and a level playing field for  digital networks and innovative services to flourish; (3) maximising the growth potential of the digital  economy. In particular a composite index has been introduced for the measuring the results of the digital  agenda objectives: The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI).  The DESI is organised around six key dimensions: 1.Connectivity; 2.Human capital; 3. Use of internet  4.Integration of digital technology; 5. Digital public services; 6. Research and Development (R&D). We  recommend the use of the index to understand the progress of each country in the EU or as general  overview. In particular, according to the set roadmap the Human Capital dimension “measures the skills  needed to take advantage of the possibilities offered by a digital society. Such skills go from basic user skills  that enable individuals to interact online and consume digital goods and services, to advanced skills that  empower the workforce to take advantage of technology for enhanced productivity and economic growth”.  In this report we conduct an analysis of the existing training and education offer in terms of ePrivacy  curricula that offer opportunities to improve the Human Capital dimensions.  Privacy is a concept that needs to be approached holistically and with an interdisciplinary perspective as  the concept is in various ways tied with social, economic, legal, political and technical aspects13. The  multifaceted nature or Privacy clearly calls for an interdisciplinary approach to Privacy14 also in terms of  training and education. In the following pages various possibilities offered by Education bodies and actors  in Europe and across diverse disciplines are presented and discussed.  12 See http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/digital-economy-and-society-index-desi  13 Clarke, R.

Privacy is a “local” concept when considered, for example  according to the definition provided before, as the right for a personal space that an individual has.  However Information Technologies and the Internet make privacy also a global issue for citizens, at least  they need to think about their action also from a global perspective. When one considers for instance the  volume of personally identifiable information that is stored or shared online it is clear that this has led to  challenges when addressing the issues of privacy and security in a global landscape. Posting personal  information to Facebook, updating a LinkedIn profile or storing documents on a cloud service such as  Hubic/Dropbox are simple actions that many citizens do these days. These actions have obvious privacy  implications, who can see the information, where this is stored or what legislation regulates the  relationship between the user and the service provider. For example when an individual uses cloud  providers to store data, this data will be stored somewhere – likely in a country different from that of the  individual - and beside the privacy associated with the data in itself, also the location of this data and the  location of the service providers will become an issue. Considering further that there is a relevant  imbalance between “data processing entities, which determine what and how data is processed, and the  individuals whose data is at stake”15, this makes the issue even more relevant for individuals. It is therefore  more and more important to understand data privacy, legal or regulatory demands in this global  landscape.  “The UK and EU research reveals that concerns about privacy and the protection of personal data are  increasingly of importance to the public.” 16 In the current situation of individual’s digital data being stored  and shared, the question has to be asked “are citizens aware of what legislation protects them when it  comes to data privacy”. In a report written by the UK Information Commissioners Office for the European  Conference for Data Protection Authorities it states that “The public need to be empowered by DPAs to  understand what their rights are, how to use them and what they should expect from organisations.” 17  Perhaps a programme of education and awareness for individual’s explaining both what data they are  potentially sharing online with what they do on a day to day basis but also what are their rights to privacy  in this digital age will help shape how companies use personal data that is potentially available to them.  15 See a discussion in http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/privacy-and-data- protection-by-design  16 Information Commissioners Office - Data protection rights: What the public want and what the public want from  Data Protection Authorities (2015)  https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431717/data-protection- rights-what-the-public-want-and-what-the-public-want-from-data-protection-authorities.pdf  17 See https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431717/data-protection-rights-what-the-public-want- and-what-the-public-want-from-data-protection-authorities.pdf  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  11  In light of these there are numerous (online) resources available that document and explain all of the  different international privacy provisions. These can be consulted by citizens, professionals or businesses  as they offer - on occasions - useful comparisons but also overviews and discussion about different  regulations and standards across the globe. While most of the existing resources are quite legalistic and  technical in nature, occasionally it is possible to find also simple and informative resources that ordinary  citizens can consults. A possible recommendation would be to try producing more of the simple and  informative tools for citizens, in this way easing the opportunities for individuals to gather knowledge and  be better informed about their own privacy. Below are some examples of existing resources that are  briefly discussed.  European Level  The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) works to ensure that European institutions and bodies  respect the right to privacy when they process personal data and develop new policies. The EDPS monitors  the processing of personal data in the EU administration and ensures compliance with the data protection  rules and advises the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council on proposals for  new legislation and a wide range of other issues having an impact on data protection18. More information  regarding data protection legislation in Europe can be found on the website19. An interesting instrument  offered by the EDPS is a comprehensive glossary of terms20, which contains a number of terms relating to  the protection of personal data, especially in the context of the EU and its institutions. The glossary is  intended to support a better understanding of the activities of the EDPS and of data protection issues in a  more general context. This is a good example of an easy to use resources that can be consulted to get  relevant definitions and some contextualisation about relevant terms.  International Level  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a non-profit organization defending civil liberties in the digital  world and focuses much of its activities on privacy and freedom of expression21. On its website the EFF has  compiled a comprehensive and detailed list of international accords on privacy and data protection. The  accords serve as the foundation for national laws, policy frameworks, and international agreements  throughout the world22. This web page offers in particular a detailed list of links (URL) and it is of ease of  access and brings together in one single location the key relevant international accords.  On their website  under ‘Our Work’, although not relevant to everyone, they explain in detail a number of significant legal  18  See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Membersmission ;  19  See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Dataprotection/Legislation  20 See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Dataprotection/Glossary  21 See https://www.eff.org/about  22  See https://www.eff.org/issues/international-privacy-standards  Users have the same rights online as they have offline; they should be aware of their rights.  National Data Protection Authorities are there to support users.  “Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning them” - art 16, The  Treaty of Lisbon  https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Membersmission https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Dataprotection/Legislation https://www.eff.org/about https://www.eff.org/issues/international-privacy-standards  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  12  cases around keys issues of privacy. A section on the same page also lists a number of whitepapers23  published from 2005 up until 2015 discussing the challenges of data privacy.  Another organisation as a source for useful references is Privacy International, a registered UK charity that  campaigns at an international level on privacy issues, have produced in collaboration with academic  institutions across the globe, a number of reports in collaboration with academic institutions that  document global privacy issues24. While the reports might not be of immediate ease to consult for citizens,  Privacy International also hosts on its website a section called Privacy 10125 which contains a collection of  articles and multimedia material that, according to Privacy International tell “everything you need to know  about how these issues affect your life”.  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) hosts on its website an easy to consult table  that “presents a comparison of privacy concepts set out in some domestic and international privacy  regulations, laws, and guidelines in relation to Generally Accepted Privacy Principles”26. While the table  does not go in depth with the analysis, it is a useful resource as it offer a synthetic comparative view  according to “Generally Accepted Privacy Principles”.  Furthermore, a number of reports have been compiled by different international companies that detail  international agreements and national laws related to privacy. Baker Hostetler, a US law firm, produced  the 2015 International Compendium of Data Privacy Laws27 . This compendium is meant as a reference  guide that outlines the basic requirements in 40 countries. It is a well organised document were the  countries are listed alphabetically and for each country it is broken down in to different sections, these  sections are ‘Applicable Law’, ‘Data Protection Authority and Registration Requirements’, ‘Protected  Personal Data, ‘Data Collection and Processing’, ‘Data Transfer’, ‘Data Security’, ‘Breach Notification’,  ‘Other Considerations’ and ‘Enforcements and Penalties’. These sections are the same for all of the  countries in the compendium detailing relevant information for that country. The Applicable Law section is  self-explanatory in that the document lists the name of the legislation and where possible includes a URL  link (most cases governmental) as a further resource and in which year it was enacted. Similarly the Data  Protection Authority and Registration Requirements section names the authority for that country and  outlines the requirements of registration for data processing. The countries definition of personal data and  also what they see as data collection and processing as well as data transfer is given in the Protected  Personal Data, ‘Data Collection and Processing section.  The Data Security section includes information on  what data security measures are required (if any) and if a breach occurs. Finally the Enforcement and  Penalties section details the sanctions that can be imposed for any breach of the legislation.  DLA Piper produced a Data Protection Laws of the World Handbook28 and an interactive map detailing data  protection laws by country29. The Handbook “sets out an overview of the key privacy and data protection  23 See https://www.eff.org/wp  24  See https://privacyinternational.org/?q=reports  25 See https://privacyinternational.org/?q=privacy-101  26 See  http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/InformationTechnology/Resources/Privacy/GenerallyAcceptedPrivacyPrinciples/ Pages/InternationalPrivacyConcepts.aspx  27  See http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/International- Compendium-of-Data-Privacy-Laws.pdf  28 See http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/  29 See  http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/world-map-section  https://privacyinternational.org/?q=reports http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/InformationTechnology/Resources/Privacy/GenerallyAcceptedPrivacyPrinciples/Pages/InternationalPrivacyConcepts.aspx http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/InformationTechnology/Resources/Privacy/GenerallyAcceptedPrivacyPrinciples/Pages/InternationalPrivacyConcepts.aspx http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/International-Compendium-of-Data-Privacy-Laws.pdf http://www.bakerlaw.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Data%20Breach%20documents/International-Compendium-of-Data-Privacy-Laws.pdf http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/world-map-section  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  13  laws and regulations across 77 different jurisdictions and offers a primer to businesses as they consider  this complex and increasingly important area of compliance”. However of particular interest for this report  is the interactive map30, which constitutes an easy to use and easy to consult instrument. Essentially the  map translates the findings of the Handbook in an interactive tool. The map offers the opportunity to  compare laws and regulations between countries and the comparison can be obtained around general  topics (i.e. Definitions, Authorities) but also around more specific and targeted topics (e.g. Privacy Offices,  Online Privacy).  While the list of resources provided here is not exhaustive but it does provide examples of some easy to  use tools and resources related with Privacy in a global perspective. There are a number of websites that  strongly support an individual’s right to privacy in today’s digital and global environment, the Electronic  Frontier Foundation and Privacy International are advocates of this and contribute to the latest research  around current and future data privacy issues. The handbook by DLA Piper and the compendium by Baker  Hostetler are useful reference materials to gain an understanding into what countries have in the way of  legislation and requirements to deal with data privacy. This gives some indication that a large number of  countries take an individual’s data privacy and organisations data processing responsibilities seriously.  In the following section (Section 4) of the report we offer now a preliminary analysis of existing training  opportunities around Privacy and Data Protection in the European context.  30 http://dlapiperdataprotection.com/#handbook/world-map-section  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  14  4. Status of NIS courses in EU31  4.1 Privacy and data protection  Education and Training  We conducted a desktop research in English in order to identify what are the current offers in terms of  education and training within Member States. Some preliminary findings show however that in Europe the  situation appears fragmented and there is little reference to privacy and data protection in any course  syllabi  although a limited number of university degrees (mainly at postgraduate level) have “privacy”  explicitly mentioned in the title.  Primary education  As an example and an indication of what education around privacy is being taught and to investigate one  particular country in depth the education provision in the UK from the age of 14 was chosen as one of the  authors has knowledge of the different levels of the educational system. Schools in the UK can currently  offer GCSE Computing which children start at 14 and sit exams at 16 followed by AS and A Level Computing  which children study from the age of 16 to 18. The syllabus for both GCSE and GCE AS and A Level  Computing was reviewed for particular reference to privacy and data protection. Within the GCSE syllabus  written by OCR and published in September 201132 it was found that the word privacy appears only once in  the entire document. Privacy is discussed under a section entitled ‘Spiritual, moral, ethical, social,  legislative, economic and cultural issues’ and is placed into context with the explanation that this  ‘encourages candidates to explore the spiritual, moral, ethical, social, legislative, and cultural aspects of  the introduction of computer-based solutions to problems through a study of their effects on society’ and  data protection’. For the term data protection, there was no reference to this as a phrase, however  protection is mentioned and is in a section entitled Software which discuss computer security and states  candidates should be able ‘describe the purpose and use of common utility programs for computer  security (antivirus, spyware protection and firewalls)’.  With results for privacy and data protection low a widening of the review to include other terms was  looked into, security was chosen and again a small results. It would appear that the focus of the GCSE  syllabus as explained out in the ‘Aims and learning outcomes’ is on the functional aspects of computing  such as developing computer programs to solve problems. A review of the GCE AS and A Level syllabus33  written by AQA and published in February 2015 for the terms privacy and data protection found that there  was no reference to either, a review of the term security found a number of entries based around the  subject of encryption and in particular different types of encryption. As with the GCSE Computing syllabus  there is a strong focus on the functional aspects of computing such as programming but also networking  and databases are included. Although the results seem clear for the UK regarding the issues around  teaching privacy in the formal context of a syllabus further investigation should look at wider aspects that  include privacy, e.g. online safety that is currently taught in schools will cover certain aspects of privacy but  in a different context. There are clear limitations with only using one country and it would be a  31 Based on a desktop research  32 OCR.

University education  A desktop research was undertaken to identify the number of University courses but also the subject area  of University courses that included the term privacy in either the title or course description, information  available in English. From the desktop it was clear that within the UK using the Universities and Colleges  Admissions (UCAS) website34, which is a central organisation through which applications are processed for  entry to higher education, there are no undergraduate degrees (Bachelors) that have privacy in the title. A  further desktop research across a number of equivalent or similar European resources35 appears to reflect  the same findings. It should be noted that by no means was this an exhaustive search as each course listed  may have a module that discusses privacy or an aspect of privacy but that was not immediately obvious  and further detailed, investigation would take a significant amount of time which would be outside of this  projects timescale36.  There is however a significant shift in results when it comes to postgraduate programmes in that there are  a number of courses that have privacy in the title or make specific reference to it in a description of the  course (see below). It appears more common that privacy is included within other degrees (e.g.  information security, informatics). In the UK the Information Security and Privacy Masters from the  University of Cardiff was found to be the only course which included privacy in the title, however upon  further reading of the course descriptions/aims of the courses found it was clear that privacy was included  as an element within the degree. The focus for most of the courses that included privacy appeared to be in  the computer science, computer security, information security and cybercrime/cyber security subject area.  However there were a number of courses that included privacy law (Information Technology, Commercial,  Corporate, Communications and Property), marketing and ethics.

A detailed understanding of the key  threats and the essential techniques for ensuring security,  privacy and trust are fundamental requirements for  successful information systems. Emerging software  deployment and use, through the use of data outsourcing  such as in Cloud computing and with the increasing use of  social media platforms, opens up significant security and  privacy issues which future IT professionals need to be aware  of. Professionals in this field are well placed for a wide variety  of employment opportunities.  http://course s.cardiff.ac.uk /postgraduat e/course/det ail/p148.html  34 See UCAS website https://www.ucas.com/  35 See http://www.prospects.ac.uk/search_courses_results.htm?t=srs&criteria.keyword=privacy&addfilter=2022  36 Some individual privacy courses are presented in the Network and Information Security courses in Europe Map  available here https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities  37 Offers on-campus IAPP Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP) certification exams to students in its  program.  http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html http://courses.cardiff.ac.uk/postgraduate/course/detail/p148.html https://www.ucas.com/ http://www.prospects.ac.uk/search_courses_results.htm?t=srs&criteria.keyword=privacy&addfilter=2022 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://www.privacyassociation.org/certification  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  16  Computer  Security  (MSc)  Radboud  University  Nijmegen  (Netherlands)  Computer security is a topic of growing importance, as ICT  affects ever more aspects of our daily lives Businesses and  government rely on ICT to an ever larger degree. Both  assessing the security of existing ICT solutions and developing  more secure solutions for the future pose major scientific and  societal challenges.  This Master track covers a broad range of topics that is  important for computer security. This includes topics in  computer science (software, computer networks, and  hardware, esp. smart-cards and RFID), but also mathematical  aspects (cryptography and security protocols), as well as  organizational and management issues, legal aspects, and  societal issues (in particular privacy).  http://www.r u.nl/english/e dueducat/ma sters/computi ng-security/  Security and  Privacy  EIT Labs  The programme in Security and Privacy focuses on the study  of the design, development and evaluation of secure  computer systems, which are also capable of ensuring privacy  for future ICT systems. It follows a constructive security  approach to teach the very complex and challenging field of  information assurance. The aim is to provide students with an  understanding of the concepts and technologies for achieving  confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and privacy protection  for information processed across networks.  http://www. masterschool .eitictlabs.eu/ programmes/ sap/  One thing that came out of the desktop search and is worth mentioning is the opportunity for students at  postgraduate level to study in other European countries (via the European Institute of Technology – EIT),  for example there is a Master in Security and Privacy at the Saarland University in cooperation with  Technische Universität Berlin in Germany and University of Trento in Italy.  With regard to the outcomes of the desktop findings something else worth noting is that looking at the  titles and course descriptions it would appear that privacy is the smaller component rather than major  focus of the programme, e.g. Computer Security and Privacy in which computer security makes up a  significant part of the programme syllabus. The variety of postgraduate educational courses available that  have privacy in the title or mention privacy in the course description perhaps reflects the wider relevance  and application of privacy as a subject. As to why it would seem that privacy only appears in postgraduate  or doctoral courses may suggest an industry requirement, for example people looking to progress their  careers were privacy is key or there is a need for further and continuing research in this dynamic subject  area. Another possible factor may be that privacy is an area that relatively lately (compared to NIS) is  gathering attention. Hence is somehow natural that the introduction of privacy into these courses is still at  an early stage. However this suggestion would require further research to be proved. Within a University  undergraduate course where you would expect the inclusion of privacy in a given subject area such as  computing, computer security or law it would likely be present but the level of detail necessary to discover  that from simply browsing University course pages may not be sufficient. Another issue to bear in mind is  that simply searching for University degree titles may be somewhat flawed, from a marketing perspective  undergraduate course titles need to be attractive and capture the interest of potential students from the  age of 14 – 18 to influence their choice therefore offering a broader area and focused titles that students  clearly understand is necessary. It could simply be that privacy is not an attractive term to use in a degree  title or the fact that potential students may not have a clear understanding of what it means.  http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/ http://www.ru.nl/english/edueducat/masters/computing-security/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  17  4.1.1 Professional education, Training and Certifications  Beyond University and Higher Education, there are a number of opportunities to obtain training on Privacy  and Data protection, aimed both at professionals working in various sectors (e.g. healthcare, education), at  entrepreneurs and also for the general public. We conducted an initial survey of existing opportunities via  a desktop research based on English keywords. Some opportunities present in MS’ have been identified  and some of the most relevant examples are briefly discussed and analysed in this section.  Of particular interest for professionals working directly in the area of privacy (e.g. Data and Privacy  officers/managers) are the Privacy Training Classes and Online Training38 offered by the International  Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). The IAPP is a not-for-profit organization that helps define,  support and improve the privacy profession globally and is the largest information privacy organization in  the world39. The IAPP training is offered both face-to-face and online. While the IAPP operates globally,  face-to-face training is offered also across Member States. These trainings are also offered in the  perspective of preparing privacy professional in obtaining the IAPP privacy certifications: CIPP (for the area  of Law and Regulations), CIPM (for operations) and CIPT (for the technologies)40. Of particular interest for  the European context are the following courses:   Foundation41, which is the foundational training for preparation for the certificate tests.   Privacy in Technologies42 (CIPT) which covers essential aspect of privacy in relation with IT (e.g.  Online Privacy, Systems Applications and Cloud Computing).   Privacy Management43 (CIPM) with a focus on business operations and privacy.   European Privacy (CIPP/E) which cover essential aspect of for the European Context such as the  Data Protection Regulations and its compliance.  The certifications offered by the IAPP are also considered relevant in the European DPO44 position paper  Professional Standards for Data Protection Officers of the EU institutions and bodies working under  Regulation (EC) 45/200145, which states that “The possession of such a certification should be considered as  an asset by EU institutions/bodies when selecting their DPO”46.  38 See  https://privacyassociation.org/learn/training-classes  39 See https://privacyassociation.org/  40 See IAPP certification descriptions at https://privacyassociation.org/certify/programs  41 See https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/FoundationCourseOutline.pdf  42 See https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/CIPTCourseOutline.pdf  43 See https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course- outlines/PrivacyProgramManagementCourseOutline.pdf  44 See https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/DPO  45 See http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf  46 See p. 5 of the position paper, available here  http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf  https://privacyassociation.org/learn/training-classes https://privacyassociation.org/ https://privacyassociation.org/certify/programs https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/FoundationCourseOutline.pdf https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/CIPTCourseOutline.pdf https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/PrivacyProgramManagementCourseOutline.pdf https://privacyassociation.org/media/pdf/certification/course-outlines/PrivacyProgramManagementCourseOutline.pdf https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/DPO http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/dataprotectionofficer/docs/dpo_standards_en.pdf  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  18  The ECDL Foundation is also a relevant provider of NIS training and has some opportunities in the area of  Privacy and Data Protection, although not extensive. In the Roadmap for NIS education programmes in  Europe the ECDL module on IT Security47 was mentioned as a relevant training opportunity in the area  security for the general public. The IT Security module offers also a reasonable coverage of Privacy related  issues across the different areas being taught, from general concepts, to privacy online, to data protection.  Indeed one of the key module goals is described as follows: Understand the key concepts relating to the  importance of secure information and data, physical security, privacy and identity theft48. Recently ECDL  officially endorsed49 a module developed by the Irish Computer Society (ICS) entitled Data Protection  Essentials50. The module is described as “relevant to all employees who handle information about clients,  or members of the public who need a basic understanding of data protection rights and responsibilities”.  Core topics of the module include Fundamental definitions, Obligations, Individual rights and Regulation  and enforcement51. In particular, the ICS has the ambition to offer the module (in its E-learning version) to  over one million Irish ECDL students by 2017. Among the targeted audiences are a variety of profiles who  on a daily basis deal with personal data, such as Human Resources staff, Legal secretaries or Health Sector  Administrators52. ICS also offers a national certification ICS Data Protection Practitioner Certificate53.  In Italy, the AICA (Italian Association for Informatics and Automatic Calculus), offers an ECDL certification  called Diritto nell'ICT54 (ICT Law) aimed at professionals working in public administration, police, law firms,  education but also aimed a citizens and students in technical and law disciplines. The certification is  composed of two modules one of which is called Protection of Personal Data: Privacy and Security55, this  module has a strong focus on the evolution of the concept of privacy and the Italian privacy laws. AICA has  also recently signed an agreement with Federprivacy, the Italian national association of privacy  professionals56, where Federprivacy recognises “18 credits” related to the certificate of quality of their  members for those who complete the AICA module on Privacy and Data Protection.  In Poland, the Polish Information Processing Society (PTI) has developed a module called e-Urzednik (e- Clerk) for the use of ICTs in public administration. This module is ECDL endorsed. While the module offers a  general perspective of the use of ICTs it also contains a section on Privacy and Data Protection, covering  European and National Legislation (section 1.2.2 of the syllabus)57. In Germany, the ECDL national operator  has developed a module called Datenschutz58 (Data Protection) “aimed at employees who regularly handle  personal data and customer data. The initiative for the module springs in large part from the increasing  need for better training in data protection”.  47 See ECDL IT Security Module: http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/index.jsp?p=2928&n=2944  48 See http://www.ecdl.org/media/ITSecurity1.pdf  49 See http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5318  50 See http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php  51 See http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php  52 See full list here: http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php  53 See http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/practitioner-certificate.php  54 See http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict  55 See syllabus http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict/per-i-candidati/Modulo%201- Protezione%20Dati%20Personali%20Ver1-0.pdf  56 See website http://www.federprivacy.it/  57 See https://www.ecdl.pl/e-urzednik  58 See http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5320  http://www.ecdl.org/programmes/index.jsp?p=2928&n=2944 http://www.ecdl.org/media/ITSecurity1.pdf http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5318 http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/essentials.php http://www.ics-skills.ie/data-protection/practitioner-certificate.php http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict/per-i-candidati/Modulo%201-Protezione%20Dati%20Personali%20Ver1-0.pdf http://www.aicanet.it/aica/diritto-ict/per-i-candidati/Modulo%201-Protezione%20Dati%20Personali%20Ver1-0.pdf http://www.federprivacy.it/ https://www.ecdl.pl/e-urzednik http://www.ecdl.org/index.jsp?p=932&n=3007&a=5320  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  19  In the UK, the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) which is an independent authority set up to uphold  information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for  individuals gives advice and guidance to members of the public and organisations regarding the various  aspects of privacy and data protection. On the ICO website there are a number of training videos59 for  organisations that raise awareness about particular issues of data protection such data protection, privacy  notices and data breaches.  In the ICO’s latest report, Information Commissioner’s Annual Report and  Financial Statements 2014/1560, a number stated that for 2014/2015 they received just over 180,000  reports in relation to PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation) which was an 11% increase  on last year.  Also in the UK, the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, fosters links between industry, academia and  business to promote new thinking, education and knowledge sharing61. As an organisation within the  computing discipline they promote continuing professional development and one method is via a series of  respected IT qualifications and one such certification is Data Protection62, which they describe ”as a way to  broaden your understanding of the law and its practical application. It incorporates the latest changes and  updates outlined in the Data Protection Act of 1998 and the way it works with the Privacy and Electronic  Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003”63.  At national level, Data Protection Officers can also act as a catalyst for training opportunities by either  signalling relevant training to interested parties or by developing and offering training material. In Ireland,  the Data Protection Commissioner has developed guides and multimedia materials64. The Commissioner  website also points interested parties to training opportunities offered by third party organisations. In UK,  the Information Commissioner’s Office also has developed training and dissemination materials65 as well as  e-learning opportunities. Across the activities run by research projects funded by the European  Commission there have been examples of training related with Privacy. For instance the FP7 Project  PRIPARE (PReparing Industry to Privacy-by-design by supporting its Application in Research) held a Training  Workshop this year (9-10 March 2015) on Privacy and the methodologies developed by the project66. The  Horizon2020 Project STARTIFY7 aims at training young future ICT entrepreneurs in Europe. The project  organises training “academies” and of particular interest was the Trento Summer Academy aimed at those  with an entrepreneurial interest in Security and Privacy by Design67 .  Some considerations of the findings from this analysis are as follows:   Training activities outside University/Higher Education are often offered in conjunction with  specific certifications both internationally and at national levels;   National Computing Associations – at least in some of the cases considered here - have a  fundamental role in offering training opportunities on Privacy and Data Protection;  59 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/training-videos/  60 See https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431982/annual-report-2014-15.pdf  61 See http://www.bcs.org/category/5651  62See  http://certifications.bcs.org/category/15742  63 See http://certifications.bcs.org/upload/pdf/infosec-dp-syllabus.pdf  64 See http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Training-and-Awareness/805.htm  65 See https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/posters-stickers-and-e-learning/  66 See http://pripareproject.eu/events/privacy-training-workshop-3/  67 See http://www.startify7.eu/trento  https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/training-videos/ https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/1431982/annual-report-2014-15.pdf http://www.bcs.org/category/5651 http://certifications.bcs.org/category/15742 http://certifications.bcs.org/upload/pdf/infosec-dp-syllabus.pdf http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Training-and-Awareness/805.htm https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/posters-stickers-and-e-learning/ http://pripareproject.eu/events/privacy-training-workshop-3/ http://www.startify7.eu/trento  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  20   National Computing Associations often work in conjunction with other providers, e.g. ECDL, in  offering training and certifications (e.g. via endorsements);   Training activities offered via EU research project appears to focus on bridging the gap between  research and practical application of methodologies and techniques;   Certification are relevant for professionals (e.g. Data Protection Officer) but in certain countries  (e.g. UK) there are more than one;   National Data Protection Offices have a relevant role in producing and disseminating training  material.  4.1.2 MOOCs: Privacy & Data Protection  MOOC – Massive Open Online Courses are a new way of delivering online education68. MOOCs are often  similar to university courses in terms of content and breadth, but the delivery model, the assessment and  the peer collaboration is different from traditional University courses. They are often delivered by elite  universities from Europe and US and hence there is the promise for top level education for a wider  audience. According to existing research, MOOCs have seen so far a high level of enrolment coupled with a  low level of completion69. The debate is still open about the effectiveness of this delivery method in  comparison to traditional university teaching70 and a recent study highlighted the merits of this  approach71. Beside the wider debate around MOOCs, whose review is outside the scope if this report, it  must be signalled that the availability of material via online platforms offer also to least engaged  participants to opportunity to acquire relevant knowledge.  The ENISA report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe, published in October 2014, did  consider the current situation around MOOCs for Network and Information Security. The report stated  that MOOC could constitute an interesting approach for delivering NIS Education to large audiences. The  report also reviewed relevant best practices such as the Cybersecurity MOOC supported by the UK  Government via the FutureLearn platform, with the goal to “raise awareness of cyber security among a  mass audience as well as providing a high quality course which will make the subject accessible to non- specialist learners”. The report also highlighted the interest of the European Commission for this method  of delivering education, via for example the OpenUpEd platform72 supported by the Long Life Learning  Program. Recently another MOOC platform project – called EMMA - has been launched by the  Commission73. Although both OpenUpEd and EMMA do not have yet MOOCs in the NIS area. The  Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe also did offer a specific recommendation about  MOOCs: Institutions should start to develop NIS MOOCs.  In addition, any future pan-European MOOC  initiatives should consider including ‘NIS for ALL’ modules within the programmes portfolio.  68 See for an exhaustive review https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13- 1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf  69 See for instance completion data from MIT and Stanford  http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped  70 See for example: https://www.edx.org/blog/comparing-effectiveness-learning-moocs  71  Colvin, K., Champaign, J., Liu, A., Zhou, Q., Fredericks, C., & Pritchard, D.

We conducted a recognition of the main MOOC platforms (edX, Coursera, FutureLearn, Udacity,  OpenUpEd, iversity, Canvas Network) as well as one from MSs national platforms (e.g. MiriadaX in Spain) in  order to map existing MOOCs offer in the area of Privacy and Data Protection74. The website MOOC-List  has also been used for this purpose75. We did a search for relevant keywords (e.g. privacy, surveillance,  confidentiality, data protection). The offer around the subject of Privacy and Data Protection is limited in  general and there is a particular lack of MOOCs in the European context, both in term of delivery by  European Universities/Institutes and also covering Privacy and Data Protection Legislations and debates at  European Levels. In total we identified eleven MOOCs on Privacy and/or Data Protection either as stand- alone courses or courses that embed at least one lecture related with privacy and data protection. Of  those taught in English, seven are (or were) delivered by US Universities and one each by an Australian  University and a European Research Institute. Interestingly there are two additional MOOCs loosely related  with Privacy and Data Protection taught in Spanish76 and French77 and delivered by European Institutes on  national MOOCs platforms.  Some conclusions of these findings are as follows:   There is a lack of offer around the subject of Privacy and Data protection (as a general keyword) in any  relevant MOOCs platform;   Some of the existing Courses overlap with the current debate around Mass Surveillance and the  NSA/Snowden Scandal;   Some courses are related with the issue of Big Data and Social Media and some with Data Protection in  the Health Sector;   OpenUpEd – the European Commission MOOC platform does not appear to have courses related with  privacy and data protection;   FutureLearn – the UK MOOC platform does not have courses on privacy and data protection;   At European Level, there are some limited examples of MOOCs on Privacy and Data Protection taught  in Member States languages other than English;   Most of the existing MOOCs are taught by US based Universities (in any case EU Universities are not  delivering on this subject in English);   Given that essentially all of the generalist offer (i.e. in English) comes from United States, the type of  content (in particular around legislations and technical requirements addressing legislation) does not  appear suitable for European Based Learners;   Privacy MOOCs are delivered within the scope of several different disciplines (Social Sciences, Law,  Computer Security, Business & Management, Health & Society, Political Science), however courses  with a NIS focus are largely underrepresented.  In general, the current situation could be much improved especially in terms of NIS education and we  develop in the recommendations’ section. A positive note is however the already noted existence of  74 These MOOC are available on map at https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities  75 See https://www.mooc-list.com/  76 See https://www.miriadax.net/web/derecho-redes-sociales  77 See https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/CNAM/01013/session01/about  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://www.mooc-list.com/ https://www.miriadax.net/web/derecho-redes-sociales https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/CNAM/01013/session01/about  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  22  MOOCs in languages other than English developed in Spain and France. Given that MOOCs are essentially  stand-alone courses which can be delivered over a short number of weeks and that are taken by students  which are other than traditional university students (often people which already have University degrees),  there is scope for developing more offer in the area, also covering the different aspects of Privacy and Data  Protection at social, economic, legal and technical levels.  In particular, with the increased interest in the subject of Privacy-by-Design (see for example the ENISA  report Privacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering78) and the engineering of privacy  in system design, it is surprising that there is no offer around this aimed at software developers and data  protection officers. Perhaps a more comprehensive MOOC offer would help bridging the “awareness and  e-illiteracy gaps” that the report Privacy and Data Protection by Design did identify as a major issue for the  diffusion of privacy-by-design best practice in the design and implementation of software systems.  Software developers and data protection officers may find in MOOCs the opportunity to acquire  knowledge about privacy-by-design, while studying at their own pace.  Likewise, in the European context there has been an intense debate around Privacy and Data Protection,  for instance with regard to recent initiative and events: the proposed right to Erasure, the EU Privacy Seal,  the reform of the Data Protection Legislation in Europe79, the mass-surveillance issues. These are all  aspects that could feature in MOOCs aimed at Law and Social/Business experts and scholars. Currently  however this offer appears non-existent for specialised areas.  Therefore, the recommendation offered by last year report around the idea  of having European Institutes  developing more MOOCs offer in the area of Cybersecurity, appears even more valid in the area of Privacy  and Data Protection. European Institutes could also take advantage of existing European platforms and  initiatives in this area such as the OpenUpEd and the EMMA platforms, both funded by the European  Commission. The recommendation from last year report also insisted on “for Beginners” MOOCs, aimed at  a wider audience, of which the already mentioned Cybersecurity MOOC sponsored by the UK government  and delivered on the FutureLearn platform is an example. The non-English MOOCs (in French and Spanish)  described before appear quite generalist an approach and this seems a step in the relevant direction. Of  the English taught courses, one is offered as an introduction to data privacy for non-experts in particular  aimed at educators (i.e. teachers) at all level80. However this is strongly shaped by the US context.  78 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/deciphering-the-landscape-for-privacy-by-design  79 See http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/review/index_en.htm  80 See https://www.canvas.net/browse/excelined/courses/data-privacy-get-schooled  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/deciphering-the-landscape-for-privacy-by-design http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/review/index_en.htm https://www.canvas.net/browse/excelined/courses/data-privacy-get-schooled  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  23  4.2 Other specialized topics: Short Review of Privacy and Data Protection Quizzes and  Serious Games  While traditionally games (both digital and offline) are seen as having only an entertaining goal,  researchers and industry have started to explore the fusion of game-based approaches and Information  Technologies for serious purposes81. Serious and educational games are these days used in a variety of  contexts and fields that include for example promotion of well-being and rehabilitation, general education  or training of professionals. The use of serious games and gamified approaches to learning constitutes an  interesting path to explore also in terms of NIS education and awareness 82 83 84 and the creation of the NIS  pilot quiz by ENISA - for the activities of the 2014 Cyber Security Month- also follows this perspective. The  2015 activities related with the quiz are described in the next section of this report. In this section of the  report instead are briefly reviewed some of the existing entertaining- gamified opportunities for learning  and training in the area of Privacy and Data Protection. The material presented in this section has been  collected via a desktop research, during the months of May-July 2015. The review offered here does not  pretend to be exhaustive, and the goal is to preliminary discuss some types of existing games, consider  what are the intended audiences of these games and highlight best practices emerging from the gamified  approach. More research work would eventually be required for an exhaustive and better conceptualised  review on the subject of serious gaming in Privacy and Data Protection.  Serious Game is the modern tool using the front end of a game (mainly to engage the player) and a back  end engine to gather useful data which could use for improving work process efficacy and expanding  knowledge base85.  Clark Abt discussion in this book Serious Games86: Reduced to its formal essence, a game is an activity  among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting  context. A more conventional definition would say that a game is a context with rules among adversaries  trying to win objectives. We are concerned with serious games in the sense that these games have an  explicit and carefully thought-out educational purpose and are not intended to be played primarily for  amusement.  Across the web it is not uncommon to find quizzes or serious games in which a gamified entertaining  activity is matched with goals of raising awareness, disseminate best practices and offering additional  81 See for an overview the following publication Susi, T., Johannesson, M. & Backlund, P.

It is for example not uncommon to find quizzes about Privacy  published by news and media outlets (e.g. newspapers) as a complement to articles87 or other media  initiative on the subject.  More relevant for the purpose of this brief review are examples of quizzes that have been developed by  public authorities and public initiatives with the intent to raise awareness about specific aspects of, for  example, current legislation, general practices and general attitudes of population. An example of a quiz  developed by a public authority is the Privacy and Data Protection Quiz88 of the UK Information  Commissioner’s Office. This quiz is an entertaining way of disseminating the results of an annual survey  which is conducted by the Information Officer on 1500 respondents: the quiz offers participants the  opportunity to see how their view compares to that of the general public. Another example of a quiz  developed by a public authority, is a quiz on data protection created by the Data Protection Office of the  Rehinland-Pfalz Land in Germany89. The quiz offers participants an opportunity to test their knowledge  with particular emphasis on “the Internet and social media such as Facebook”. The same public authority  also offers a quiz on data protection for young people90, where participants are asked to guide the quiz  character “Ben” in his digital life and helping him making choices that are relevant for his data protection  and privacy. Outside Europe a similar initiative has been presented by the Office of the Privacy  Commissioner in Canada with a quiz for young people91 and one for businesses92. In both these quizzes the  goal is to make each participant test “How well do you know your privacy rights?”. Another example comes  from the Klicksafe93 project co-funded by the European Union, which is an awareness campaign promoting  media literacy and adequate handling of the Internet and new media. The Klicksafe project offers a  number of quizzes (available only in German) relevant for young people online life, including a quiz offering  tips about Privacy and Data Protection94. The quiz comes with an appealing graphical interface and the use  of avatars to guide participants across real-life scenario situations and quiz questions.  87 See for example http://newsquiz.sciencemag.org/privacy/,  http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-do-you-know- about-data-privacy-1429499471, http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-01-29/conosci-privacy-web- 072247.shtml?sondaggi, http://www.journaldunet.com/questionnaire/fiche/14520/d/f/1/  88 See https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/privacy-and-data-protection-quiz/  89 See https://datenschutzquiz.hs-kl.de/  90 See http://www.verbraucherzentrale-rlp.de/datenschutz-quiz  91 See https://www.priv.gc.ca/youth-jeunes/quiz/index_e.asp  92 See https://www.priv.gc.ca/quiz/html_e.asp  93 See http://www.klicksafe.de/  94 See http://www.klicksafe.de/qz/quiz03/_project/  http://newsquiz.sciencemag.org/privacy/ http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-do-you-know-about-data-privacy-1429499471 http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-do-you-know-about-data-privacy-1429499471 http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-01-29/conosci-privacy-web-072247.shtml?sondaggi http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/tecnologie/2014-01-29/conosci-privacy-web-072247.shtml?sondaggi https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/privacy-and-data-protection-quiz/ https://datenschutzquiz.hs-kl.de/ http://www.verbraucherzentrale-rlp.de/datenschutz-quiz https://www.priv.gc.ca/youth-jeunes/quiz/index_e.asp https://www.priv.gc.ca/quiz/html_e.asp http://www.klicksafe.de/ http://www.klicksafe.de/qz/quiz03/_project/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  25  Graph 1 – Screenshot of one of the questions composing the Klicksafe.de quiz on Data Protection  (Datenschutz)  These just mentioned are all examples that show the interest of public authorities in leveraging  entertaining quizzes for disseminating knowledge about ePrivacy. Quizzes are created for both young  people but also for other audiences, such as the general public or even companies. On the other side, the  use of quizzes confirms again the important role of Privacy and Data Protection Offices and other public  initiatives in offering training and learning opportunities.  Quizzes are a type of entertaining approach which offers learning opportunities leveraging a model of  sequential questions & answers. There are a few known examples of other types of games (both digital  and offline) related with Privacy and Data Protection aimed at schools, general audience and also  professionals. While the landscape of serious gaming about Privacy and Data Protection appears quite  fragmented and some of the existing games are now inactive or not used further, there are some relevant  examples which deserve to be mentioned in this report.  A first series of games are role-playing games in which players assume a fictional role, often that of  organisations who collect and deal with personal data. The scope of these role-playing games is to make  players understand how their personal data are collected, managed and used, often by very ruthless  organisations. A first example is the game Data Dealer95 a non-profit project and licensed under Creative  Commons in which “players take on the role of unscrupulous \"data dealers\", collect personal data all over  the internet, and learn how to turn this information into cash”96. Data Dealer is a browser game that  promotes awareness about how companies could collect personal data and the use they can make of this  data, and this is achieved by offering player the opportunity to take the role of these companies and  collect and exploit personal data. The game has received relevant news coverage and won the Most  Significant Impact Games for Change award in 201397.  95 See http://datadealer.com  96 See http://datadealer.com/about  97 See http://www.gamesforchange.org/2013/06/winners-of-the-g4c-awards-announced/  http://datadealer.com/ http://datadealer.com/about http://www.gamesforchange.org/2013/06/winners-of-the-g4c-awards-announced/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  26  Graph 2 – Screenshot of the Data Dealer educational game98  A non-digital game with a similar approach, was the Privacy Traders, a role-playing game originally  developed for the Internet Governance Forum Italy in 2011. The game was aimed at high school students  to be played in class. In this role-play game, students playing in groups could take the role of four or more  social networks and the scope of the game is to collect personal information of participants. The winner  will be who has collected the larger amount of personal data of other participants. In this way students  would learn that the key business practice of Social Network Sites is indeed the collection and exploitation  of personal data and that a Social Network account does not just come “for free” as users in fact trade in  their personal data. An interesting aspect of the Privacy Traders was that its content and gaming outcomes  were clearly linked with the work of the Italian Privacy Authority (so-called Garante Della Privacy), as the  game was accompanied by the explanation from an expert99 of how Privacy regulations in Italy would  apply to collection of personal data. Young people participating to the game received then also notions  about privacy regulations in Italy and how companies collecting private data should behave in accordance  to regulation. Similar to the previous two examples is the Privacy Game proposed by the Open  University100, again a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a fictional character and “make  decisions about what information characters might reveal to others and what they keep to themselves”. In  this case the role assumed is not that of a company collecting data, but that of a data subject (e.g. Internet  Shopper, Employer or even Hacker). The learning goal of the game is to highlight for players the value of  personal information as commodity. Another interesting example was the game Friend Inspector101. While  the above discussed role-playing games are general purpose in their application, Friend Inspector was a  game directly aimed at Facebook users and it had an explicit goal: raising awareness of Privacy in Social  Network Sites. Friend Inspector was a browser game that allowed participants to check who can see their  Facebook account and what information they have access to. The game also offered final  98 The game, including this image is released with a Creative Commons license Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC-BY-SA  3.0)  99 The expert presentation (in Italian) is also available as a Youtube video as part of the “game pack”, see  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9irSEkdQDfs  100 The game is hosted by the Centre for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy (CRISP)  101 See http://www.friend-inspector.org/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9irSEkdQDfs http://www.friend-inspector.org/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  27  recommendations on how players can improve their privacy on Facebook102. The game is now inactive due  to Facebook change of privacy policy as the end of April 2015. An additional example is a game created by  the Pan-EU Youth project103 using the game format play-decide104. These games offer young people the  opportunity to “Organise vivid debates with your friends at home or in the classroom and come up with a  policy on different issues on online responsibility and digital literacy”105. Specifically, the Privacy and Data  Protection play-decide game106, is a card game in which young people have the opportunity to debate  issues surrounding Privacy and is organised in three stages107, according to the play-decide format. The  first stage is the initial gathering of information supported by a set of cards containing information about  Privacy and Data Protection facts. The second step is a group discussion in which participants talk about  key themes of Privacy and Data Protection, again using a set of cards. The third and final stage is the  outcome of the game in which participants reach the formulation of policies on Privacy and Data  Protection. An interesting aspect of the game is that the policies formulated by playing the game can later  be shared on the Pan-EU Youth website. A last example of a game in the European Context is the \"The  earthquake data\"108 a card game for 2-4 people, which has been created for students of secondary schools  and vulnerable adults. The game is only available in Polish language under the original name of “Trzęsienie  danych” and has been created by the Panoptykon Foundation109. The game offers information to players  on how to better protect their privacy in everyday life. The game cards contain links to articles on the web  with additional information and practical advice.

The first is a game developed by the Canada’s  Centre for Digital and Media literacy, called Privacy Playground: The First Adventure of the Three  CyberPigs110. As stated on the teacher’s guide “The purpose of the game is to teach kids how to spot online  marketing strategies, protect their personal information and avoid online predators111”. Of particular  interest is that the game cater for a very young audience of pupils between 8-10 years of age. The game is  a graphical novel which readapts the story of the three little pigs and guides players trough scenarios and  quiz related with Privacy and the protection of their personal data. The second game is called Privacy and  Security Challenge112 and was created by The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology's (ONC) Office of the Chief Privacy Officer (OCPO) in the United States. This example is  different from the others discussed so-far as the game is used for training in first response situations, i.e.  situations that are dangerous or difficult to conduct in reality.  Specifically the game aims at training health  care provider professionals (e.g. nurses) to respond to Privacy and security challenges faced in a typical  small medical practice. This is a relevant approach leveraging serious games for training that clearly go  beyond raising awareness only. This is the only example identified in this short review that leverages this  approach to training professionals.  In conclusion, serious games are a path which is being explored as a way to transfer knowledge, support  learning, raise awareness, offer professional training and unveil controversial issues and practices  surrounding Privacy and Data Protection.  There are some relevant points to consider in conclusion of this  section. The landscape of serious gaming appear quite fragmented and some of the existing games, while  interesting, do seem now abandoned (e.g. Privacy Traders) or obsolete due to various reasons (e.g. Friend  Inspector, due to Facebook change of Privacy Policy). Of relevance of the gamified approach is the use of  gaming to reach a varied audience from very young people (e.g. pupils, high school students), to citizens,  to professionals. This shows how gamified approaches are flexible tools for dissemination, learning and  awareness at different levels and the recommendation is to continue exploring serious gaming in the area  of Privacy and Data Protection. Another interesting aspect to consider is that a good number of the games  discussed here is released under Creative Commons licenses113, this is a best practice that can support  wider re-play and in some cases further adaptations of the games. In particular non-digital games often  come with downloadable game “packs”, so that interest parties (e.g. schools) can download the game  material and instructions and print it for their own play. It is also relevant to note that there is interest in  110 See http://mediasmarts.ca/game/privacy-playground-first-adventure-three-cyberpigs  111 See http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/pdfs/games/privacy_playground_guide_2015.pdf  112 See http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/privacy-security-training-games  113 See http://creativecommons.org/  http://mediasmarts.ca/game/privacy-playground-first-adventure-three-cyberpigs http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/mediasmarts/files/pdfs/games/privacy_playground_guide_2015.pdf http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/privacy-security-training-games http://creativecommons.org/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  29  developing serious games that are non-digital/offline (e.g. board, card games) that can be played  collectively and in person by participants. This is an important best practice. Indeed, digital games  (including quizzes) are often single-player114 and therefore less able to support peer-learning and critical  discussion among players and between players and facilitators (e.g. teachers). Finally a further possible  recommendations is that games should also be accompanied by processes of evaluation of their results.  This would be relevant in order to verify how effective the gamified approach is for learning or training and  what could be done better in Privacy and Data Protection Games.  114 To this is an exception Open University Privacy Game that supports both single and multiplayer games.

Educational tools  5.1 The new version of the Education map115  A database has been created by ENISA with information on Network and Information Security courses in  Europe in the context of a close partnership with WG3 of NIS Platform. It was launched in October 2014  with the context of the advocacy campaign European Cyber Security Month. The database lists a number  of available courses and certification programmes linked to Network and Information Security, privacy and  data protection.  ENISA is working to enhance the database and the 2015 version contains relevant improvements among  which it is important to mention:  improvements to the search functionality, a better display of the  information which will ease users in consulting the available material and finally a better promotion of the  database towards education providers that will facilitate and support them to encode and add their offers  to the database. Regarding metrics and current size of this tool:  after +1 year of existence this map  displays 22 countries in Europe and includes more than 400 entries. ENISA encourages Higher Education  and Long Life Learning providers to include their offer in this map.  Graph 5- existing entries on the map year 1  5.2 The NIS quiz from pilot to version 1.0  In 2014, as part of the European Cyber Security Month116 and its NIS eEducation activities, ENISA has  developed a NIS self-assessment pilot quiz. The pilot quiz has originally been created with several goals in  mind. The first one is to disseminate best practices and notions around NIS – with particular emphasis on  general security and privacy - to a broad non-specialist audience. The model of the questions chosen for  the quiz has been that of a scenario, in which a narrative-short story is presented to participants and then  three options are offered as possible answers to the scenario problem. Participants are then asked to  select one of the options. Upon selection of an answer – whether correct or not – an explanation/feedback  is offered to participants on why the answer is correct or not within the context of the scenario. In addition  to the textual feedback, additional links to relevant material to consult are also offered. In this way  participants can with a single click, access relevant report and additional content. In graph 6 there is an  example of a question taken from the 2014 pilot quiz: a scenario is presented to participants – in the  example in graph 6 a scenario about botnets – then three options/answers are presented.  115 See https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities  116 See https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  31  In the example the participant has selected an incorrect answer and then there is the  explanation/feedback about the answer with a pointer to an ENISA report for more information.  Graph 6 – Example of a scenario and the feedback on an incorrect answer from the pilot quiz.  A second goal of the quiz was to combine together an entertaining-gamified activity with a serious  educational goal: offer via a quiz-game an opportunity for participants to familiarise themselves with some  of the key themes of NIS Education and some of the recommendations contained in a number of ENISA  reports. In this way the quiz also served a third goal: better disseminate part of the ENISA work to citizens  and other interested stakeholders. In particular several questions of the pilot quiz have been created using  a number of ENISA reports and recommendations – mainly those aimed at end users – and references to  reports are offered in the feedback to each answer. In addition, at the end of the quiz a list of all the  reports used for building the quiz is presented to participants (see graph 7).  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  32  Graph 7 – List of ENISA report presented at the end of the quiz to participants on which the pilot quiz is  based  The pilot quiz has received positive feedback from citizens, experts and public authorities. Most  importantly the quiz was completed by a good number of participants (see data in the next paragraph)  across the world. Therefore building on the encouraging results of the pilot, this year ENISA has continued  working on the idea of a quiz as an important approach to disseminate NIS practices to a wider audience of  non-experts. The approach adopted for the 2015 edition of the quiz, considers: overcoming shortcomings  observed in the test-pilot as well, make improvements in the areas of content and usability and keep intact  aspects of the pilot that worked well in particular the format of the question and the dissemination of  ENISA material. Therefore the goal for this year work is to make the pilot evolve into a more stable and  solid quiz, with additional questions, better scenarios, graphical and general use improvements. In the  following paragraphs some reflections are offered on the results of last year work and there is a  presentation of key results from last edition of the quiz. There is also a discussion about how these results  have informed the new quiz this year. There is then a discussion of the key aspects of the new version of  the quiz.  5.2.1 Results achieved with the pilot quiz in 2014  In this section of the report are present some data and results of the 2014 pilot quiz. Both numerical data  related with participation and examples of the textual feedback received from participants are presented.  These data have been taken in account to inform decisions for this year work on the quiz.  The pilot version of the quiz was launched by ENISA as part of the European Cyber Security Month  activities on 23 October 2014. In term of overall participation the quiz page has been visited by almost  40.000 (thousands) users and the quiz was completed (from start to finish) by 1400 participants. The quiz  has also been completed by participants from 81 countries, with clear prevalence of EU countries – with  some exceptions (United States and India also appear in the list of top 10 countries, perhaps due to the  quiz being in English). In the top 10 list of countries we have Belgium, United Kingdom, Greece,  Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Spain and Estonia. While the number of participants that completed the quiz  and the spread across the globe are very encouraging, there is also a gap between the number of unique  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  33  visitors to the quiz (almost 40 thousands) and the number of those who completed it. This is an aspect  which will be taken in account this year and improvements are planned to increase the number of people  completing the quiz from start to finish. In graph 8 is displayed the breakdown of participation across the  period of the Cyber Security Month (October – November) and the remaining months up to June 2015,  when the work on the new version of the quiz started.  Graph 8- Monthly breakdown of participants – with emphasis on the Cybersecurity Month period.  During last year piloting work, particular emphasis was placed on offering participants the opportunity to  give impressions, comments and feedback to ENISA. The goal was to collect material that could be used for  making improvements for future editions of the quiz and also listen to participant ideas. An important  aspect of this was the initial self-assessment of participants. ENISA together with its experts agreed that  the quiz should be a simple way to measure some of the participants’ skills related to NIS but should also  offer a way for participants to identify knowledge and skills gaps and offer information on how to bridge  these gaps. The quiz came with diverse levels of difficulties and at the beginning participants were asked to  self-assess their level of knowledge, according to three different levels  - beginner, intermediate, advanced  and do not know117 - and where, upon their selection, thus directed to the appropriate level quiz.  Graph 9 – Form of the Preliminary self-assessment for participants  In graph 10 it is possible to see the breakdown of participants in terms their initial self-assessment. The  quiz has been completed most at the advanced level (503 completion) and less at the beginner level (429  completion) although the variation between the two is not enormous. In perspective this tells probably  that more work needs to be done to increase participation and engagement for non-expert, as they were  indeed the main target audience for the 2014 pilot quiz. For this year edition the key focus will indeed be  117 The selection of the “do not know” option would lead participants to the beginner version of the quiz.  399 404  597  0  200  400  600  800  Oct-14 Nov-14 Dec 2014 - Jun 2015  Quiz Completion in the Cybersecurity  Month and after  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  34  on the beginner and intermediate levels of the quiz. A further consideration made during the discussion of  the experts is that probably the label “beginner” is not the most appropriate as it might point to  weaknesses of participants and for this year this will be replaced with more neutral labels (e.g. “initial  level” or “level 1”). An additional feature of the pilot quiz was also that upon good results in a lower level  of the quiz (e.g. beginner) the platform would encourage participants to take the next advanced level (e.g.  intermediate), thus encouraging participants to learn more and have a better sense of their knowledge.  This feature could also have had some impact on the increase rate in completion leaning toward higher  levels, however analytics measures for this aspect are not available.  Graph 10 - Breakdown of participants based on their self-assessment  In addition to the self-assessment, the pilot quiz did offer participants opportunities to provide textual  feedback to ENISA, both in term of their expectations about the quiz (prior to start the quiz) and at the end  as a general feedback about the engagement with the quiz asking what could be improved and what they  enjoyed about the quiz. The purpose for asking participants their comments was to gather evidences about  the relevance of this initiative directly from participants and have material to be used for shaping and  improving future editions of the quiz. In graph 11 is presented the feedback from appearing at the end of  the pilot quiz.

Some examples of  what the participants did like about the quiz:  It was reassuring and the responses after each question explained the answers simply.  I have learnt a little bit more about security. Now I assess the links that will help me to improve my  knowledge about security in the internet.  On the questions that I got wrong, the correct answer had good feedback with i.e. links to articles that  explain it all in (more) detail.  These comments point to relevant strengths of the quiz, in particular the opportunity for participants to  learn more about security and the emphasis placed on detailed feedback and additional material to  consult. As already discussed, these elements will remain part of the new version of the quiz.  The following are suggestions about what could be improved and done better:  I think some of the questions were a bit ambiguous - it is difficult from the description to pick one  particularly correct answer when more than one of the actions may be reasonable. Appreciate this is  difficult to get right with this sort of quiz.  Some of the answers should be explained a little bit more as to understand the right idea behind them.  Language, I think the different scenarios could be described in a simpler language, therefor enabling  easier access to the non-native English speakers.  These feedback points to some of the weaknesses of the quiz, and in particular the wording of scenarios  and answers which on occasion could be simplified hence offering a better understanding to participants.  Also these considerations have been taken in account for this year work.  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  36  5.2.2 Usability and other issues in the pilot version  The pilot version of the quiz has been reviewed both by usability experts and by the experts collaborating  with ENISA in term of its usability and graphical appealing and several improvements have been discussed  and planned for the new version in 2015, also taking in account the users’ feedback. Recommendations  output of this review include:   The introduction of multimedia material (rather than having just a textual quiz) where possible, in  order to: improve the general and lasting engagement with the quiz, offer better explanations to  participants, support participants across the whole breadth of the quiz and increase the number of  full completion of the quiz.   Better explanation of why a certain answer is correct within a scenario. Since the questions are  based on a narrative, answers are contextual to the narrative itself. One of the recommendations  received relates with the idea of offering better explanations as to why a specific answer is indeed  correct in the scenario, and not necessarily in general.   Increased number of quizzes. The pilot version was developed as a single quiz covering several NIS  areas. A relevant addition, already discussed also during the work of the experts both in 2014 and  2015 is to have quizzes organised around different topics (e.g. privacy or security etc.). Hence to  have multiple quizzes with participants being able to take them individually but also together for  instance with the award of the badge based on aggregated scores from the diverse quizzes.   To improve the gamification elements of the quiz. In the pilot version, these were limited to the  generation of a profile and score at the end of the quiz. A relevant addition to this year quiz are  Cyber Security Month badges that are awarded upon completion of the quiz and that participant  can share on Social Media. The use of badges is also one of the measures adopted for supporting  the full completion of the quiz by a larger number of participants.  Generally the idea is to: offer better textual descriptions, streamline the number of quizzes across diverse  subjects, improve the gamification aspects to create better engagement and add multimedia material to  better support the completion of the quizzes by participants. In the next section there is a discussion of  how these recommendations have shaped the new version of the quiz.  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  37  5.2.3 Version 1.0 of the Quiz  The general concepts and organisation of the 2015 quiz will remain similar to the original 2014 pilot (see  Graph 12). With some relevant improvements that are briefly presented in this section. The participant will  choose the difficulty level then select the choice between topics: Privacy or General security. Furthermore  they will reply to 10 scenarios by choosing an answer from the provided ones. Each answer will come with  an explanation and at the end a Cyber Security Month badge.  Graph 12 – Structure of the 2015 quiz  The questions will be presented to participants as scenarios/narratives with 3 options/answers among  which to choose. Similarly to the 2014 edition each answer will be accompanied with specific feedback and  additional material to consult. This approach has indeed proven successful for disseminating best practices  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  38  and for driving engagement. The feedbacks received from participants about this format have also been  encouraging. Relevant changes introduced this year in comparison to last year pilot are the following:   For this year there will be two quizzes rather than just one: one quiz will be devoted to general  security and the other one to privacy. This will be achieved by splitting the 2014 pilot quiz  questions (i.e. dividing those related with privacy from those related with security) and adding  additional questions to sum up to 10 questions for each quiz. In this way last year work will be  capitalised and extended, offering more content alongside the content already produced.   In this edition there will be two difficulties levels for the quiz, those that in the early pilot  corresponded to beginner and intermediate levels. The reason for this choice is the will to engage  with the quiz mainly the general audience rather than security experts, hence more effort is  devoted to develop a quiz for this specific audience which is the one that could receive additional  benefits from the quiz.   The Usability of the quiz has been substantially improved with: (1) a virtual avatar acting as a “guru  guide” through the quiz, in order to make the quiz more personal and increase the engagement,  (1) one short explanatory video in order to increase engagement and offer better explanations of  the goals and achievements of the quiz.   Wording of 2014 scenarios, answers and feedbacks has been simplified were possible. For new  questions developed in 2015 wording has been kept simpler in comparison to 2014 questions. In  this way the key feedback received from users will be addressed.   The version 1.0 will use a better gamified approach. Among other things this year there has been  the introduction of Cyber Security Month Badges, in order to offer a better engagement, reward  and opportunity to share results on Social Media.

Conclusion  This report has provided an initial mapping and a discussion about existing education and training  opportunities with particular focus on ePrivacy and has connected these with the wider offer of NIS  education discussed in the previous 2014 report Roadmap for NIS education programmes in Europe.  What has emerged from this analysis are strengths and weaknesses in the current landscape, but most  importantly several relevant best practices have been identified and possible improvements have been  signalled. What follows is a list of initial recommendations (both at EU and MS’ levels) based on the  results of the report, EU level organisations (e.g. University Networks, Users’ Coalitions and  Multipliers, Education institutions); Member State level organisations (e.g. Education institutions,  NGOs, think tanks, Governments).  6.1 For European level stakeholders   Consider to analyse the quantity of the offer of courses in MSs.   Consider to conduct further research to better understand how Privacy subjects are embedded in  undergraduate degrees. The report has highlighted that Privacy does not seem to feature in titles  of undergraduate degree courses and further research would be required to understand why (e.g.  if it is for marketing purposes or if there is a skill gap in current offer).   Consider to invest in MOOCs on Privacy and Data Protection, covering both basic and advanced  topics, for non-expert and expert audiences. There is a general lack of Privacy and Data Protection  MOOCs in the EU context, however this delivery opportunity could be better exploited also via  existing supported platforms (i.e. OpenUpEd and EMMA).   Consider to invest in MOOCs with a NIS focus, in particular addressing the issue of privacy-by- design and European Legislation. The report has highlighted that there is scope for some specific  MOOCs relating with issues currently debated at a European Level.   Consider to further explore serious games as a path to reach a varied audience of both experts and  non-experts. In particular, serious games should support re-playability and ideally be distributed  with non-restrictive licenses in order to support adaptation and wider reuse in educational settings  and by the public more generally. Consider investing resources also on the evaluation of results  achieved with serious games.   Consider exploring serious gaming not only for raising awareness but also as a training ground for  first-responders and other professionals. In the European context, serious games around Privacy  and Data Protection focuses extensively on education and awareness. While these are  fundamental aspects, there is also scope for using serious games for training first response  professionals.  Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States  Published  | Version 4 |  education  |  October 2015  40  6.2 For Member State level   Consider to create synergies with other countries in terms of transfer of best practices.   Consider to create metrics and assess the progress and the offer from the education providers.   Games available in one of the MS language could be translated to other languages, for a wider  impact, when applicable. The use of Creative Commons licenses could support this.   The report has highlighted that some of the existing MOOC are available in National Languages,  this is clearly an advantage and a good practice. Other MSs could consider develop Privacy and  Data Protection MOOCs in the respective MS’ languages.   Should consider to explore the offer of serious games and enrich it.   Consider to join ENISA’s project quiz in order to raise awareness by participating in the spread of  general quizzes and awareness month.

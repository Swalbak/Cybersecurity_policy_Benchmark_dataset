In less than 30 years they have  surpassed the traditional fixed line telephony. Every day millions of European citizens rely on mobile  telephony for work, social life, but also to contact emergency services. Hence outages of a mobile  network can have a severe impact on the economy and on society.  Mobile network outages are common. In 2012, EU Member States reported 79 significant incidents  of electronic communications to ENISA and the European Commission. Most of these incidents had  an impact on mobile telephony and mobile Internet.  The goal of this report is to help National Regulatory Authority (NRAs) understand if and how  roaming at national level could be used to improve resilience of mobile communication networks  and services in case of large outages and start the discussion with the market players around this  topic.  In some countries, national roaming is imposed by the NRAs with the objective to promote and  stimulate competition by facilitating the entrance of new actors in the market. Sometimes national  roaming is implemented on a voluntary basis between operators without intervention or request  from the NRA for commercial purposes but as it will become clear in this report it can also be used to  mitigate outages.  ENISA is aware that each Member State has a different regulatory approach and  telecommunications market. For these reasons this report, after investigating the technical and  organizational aspects, presents a portfolio of solutions that can be applied based on the different  markets and regulations:   No roaming   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection   Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection   Roaming permanently activated by the customer  Member States are invited to use this as a starting point for the discussion of national roaming as a  resilience solution with the mobile telecom operators in order to develop schemes to mitigate large  outages following the resulting recommendations:  Discuss portfolio of solutions offered - In this way they can use these options as a base to tailor their  own solution taking into consideration their own legal constrains and needs and agreements among  operators.  Promote National Roaming awareness – Each Member State should work with interested parties  such as mobile operators on National roaming solutions awareness in case of outages.  Identify clear thresholds in case of activation - In case one of the above solutions is selected, ENISA  invites the competent authority to define clear thresholds both in users affected and time limit in  order to facilitate the emergency response.  Prioritize voice and SMS - Another important recommendation includes services prioritization. In  case of activation of national roaming as a resilience solution not all types of traffic should be  transferred at one time on the other operator in order to avoid congestion.  Favour open Wi-Fi as alternative solution for data connectivity – Data connectivity should be  transferred to available wireless networks.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  v  Establish a M2M inventory - Considering the current trend and growth of M2M technologies  regarding smart cities and public utilities, it is auspicated that every Member State starts to develop  with providers an inventory of all these SIMs per service and provider in order to assess the possible  impact and define a comprehensive continuity plan in case of outage.  Be prepared for an eventual mobile network outage - Member States should consider   a comprehensive national risk assessment framework that takes into account not only  single provider’s business continuity plans but   envisions also cascading effects on the population and critical services as government  and public transport for example.  Identify key people within CI services - Key people and key services should be identified and  emergency preparedness plan should be defined accordingly.  Mobile communication networks and services have become an integral part of everyday life. People  are now more and more reliant on their mobile phone and expect to be connected anywhere at any  time. Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda remarked: “Telecom touches  everything and users are developing massive expectations of it. Markets must function, devices must  function, networks must function and investment needs to happen.”  For these reasons ENISA investigated national roaming as a solution for mitigating outages in order  to foster security and resilience of European communications networks and ensure that European  citizens can communicate also in case of major outages.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Digital_Agenda  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  vi  Table of Contents  Executive summary iv  1 Introduction 1  2 The role of mobile communications in everyday life 4  2.1 Penetration and adoption of mobile communications 4  2.2 Machine to Machine 5  2.3 Mobile network access at the home operator 6  2.4 Roaming 9  3 Existing national roaming schemes 11  3.1 Types of roaming schemes 11  3.2 National roaming in the EU 13  3.3 National roaming outside the EU 18  4 Limitations and challenges 20  4.1 Limitations 20  4.2 Challenges 21  5 Technical solutions for mitigating mobile network outages 24  5.1 No national roaming 24  5.2 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection 25  5.3 Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards 27  5.4 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection 29  5.5 Roaming permanently activated by the customer 30  6 Recommendations 32  Recommendation 1:  Discuss portfolio of solutions offered 32  Recommendation 2:  Promote National Roaming awareness 32  Recommendation 3:  Favour mutual aid agreements 32  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  vii  Recommendation 4:  Identify clear thresholds in case of activation 32  Recommendation 5:  Prioritize voice and SMS 33  Recommendation 6:  Favour open Wi-Fi as alternative solution for data connectivity 33  Recommendation 7:  Establish a M2M inventory 33  Recommendation 8:  Be prepared for an eventual mobile network outage 33  Recommendation 9:  Identify key people within CI services 34  7 References 35  EU Legislation 35  Other papers 35  Internet pages 36  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  Mobile communications are an integral part of everyday life. In less than 30 years they have  surpassed the traditional fixed line telephony. Every day millions of European citizens rely on mobile  telephony for work, social life, but also to contact emergency services. Hence outages of a mobile  network can have a severe impact on the economy and on society.  For example, last year there was a large mobile network outage in the Netherlands. The network of  one provider failed, causing outages in a vital economic area in the Netherlands. Millions of  customers were affected, for several days, and even public transport in a particular metropolitan  area was afflicted. It must be noticed that in this particular incident only the network of one provider  was affected. Subsequently, the Dutch government started a discussion with providers about  possibilities of using roaming to mitigate outages of mobile networks. Recently these discussions  resulted in a national roaming agreement specifically for significant mobile network outages.  Researches are on-going about possible extensions of this agreement.  ENISA has been working for several years with regulators in EU Member States to address security  and resilience of electronic communication networks. In particular, ENISA has been supporting  regulators in the implementation of Article 13a of the 2009 reform of the EU’s legislative framework  for electronic communications1. The goal is providing advice and fostering exchange of best practices  about improving the security and resilience of electronic communication networks in the EU. In this  document the reader will find an overview of different ways national roaming could be used to  address mobile outages.  Article 13a of the EU directive on a common regulatory framework for  electronic communications networks and services  As part of the 2009 reform of the EU’s legislative framework for electronic communications, a new  article in the Framework directive was added: Article 13a asks EU Member States to ensure security  and resilience of electronic communication services and networks. ENISA has been supporting the  EU Member States in implementing Article 13a. For example, ENISA set up an expert group of  experts from NRAs (national regulatory authorities) which meets several times per year to discuss  the implementation of Article 13a, past incidents, common issues and best practices. ENISA also  collects reports about significant incidents from NRAs across the EU and aggregates these reports to  provide a single EU perspective. Based on reports about past incidents and discussions with NRAs,  ENISA chooses topics for further investigation or research. This year, for example, ENISA is  investigating two topics in more detail:   Dependencies of electronic communications on power supply; this will be addressed in a  separate report.   National roaming to mitigate mobile network outages; results of our research are reported  in this document.  More information about ENISA’s work on Article 13a, and the Article 13a Expert Group can be found  at: http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13.  1  European Parliament and Council (2009), DIRECTIVE 2009/140/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25  November 2009 amending Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services  http://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  2  Trends in latest incidents  Mobile network outages are common. In this section we present some of the data NRAs reported to  ENISA and the European Commission (EC) for 2012, in the context of the Article 13a: EU Member  States reported 79 significant incidents of electronic communications to ENISA and the European  Commission. Most of these incidents had an impact on mobile telephony and mobile Internet (see  Figure 4).  Figure 1: Average number of users affected per incident per service (1000s). 2  For incidents in all four services, hardware failure was the most common cause. For mobile  telephony and mobile internet the second most common cause was a software bug.

They can use this report to start the discussion around the topic with industry experts involved in  security, resilience, and/or business continuity, especially belonging to Telecommunications  Provider. This report can be also used by civil protection, crisis management agency and critical  industries to get an idea of how to improve resilience of mobile communications for critical  functions and critical services who rely on mobile networks to function properly.  Goal & Scope  The goal of this report is to help NRAs understand if and how national roaming could be used to  improve resilience of mobile communication networks and services in their country and start the  discussion with the market players around this topic.  In this report are analysed only the core electronic communication services: mobile telephony and  mobile Internet access. Other types of mobile services or value added services are not considered.  It must be underlined that this report considers mobile phones but also mobile devices in general,  including mobile communications between machines (MTM). Moreover it should be also remarked  here that the focus is on national roaming from a resilience perspective, i.e. how national roaming  can be used to mitigate outages. Although they are mentioned at times, other types of motivations  for national roaming (for example, competition, innovation, cost-reduction, et cetera) are not  deepened.  Structure of this document  This document is structured as follows:   general background on electronic mobile communication in Europe and its technical  working;   introduction of national roaming and overview of existing national roaming agreements;   overview of challenges and limitations surrounding national roaming;   portfolio of a number of viable approaches that NRAs could evaluate to mitigate mobile  network outages using national roaming;   summary and recommendations.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  4  2 The role of mobile communications in everyday life  Mobile communication networks and services have become an integral part of everyday life. People  are now more and more reliant on their mobile phone and expect to be connected anywhere at any  time. Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda remarked: “Telecom touches  everything and users are developing massive expectations of it. Markets must function, devices must  function, networks must function and investment needs to happen.”  A good example of the possible impact of a mobile communication network outage is the previously  mentioned outage in the Netherlands 3 . In 2012, the infrastructure of a large electronic  communication operator was disrupted by a fire in a building adjacent to a site of the provider. The  consequences of the fire on the site of the provider affected about 5 million subscribers in the  western part of the country, impacting critical metropolitan areas like Rotterdam (a major port and a  major industrial area) and the Hague (the seat of the Dutch government). The outage affected both  2G and 3G communications, and had an impact on phone calls, messaging, Machine-to-Machine  communications and mobile Internet. It is important to note that due to the outage tram connection  between Utrecht - Nieuwegein were out of order too because of their reliance on M2M 2G for  communication with control centres. This incident highlights the dependency of economy and  society on mobile communication networks and services and how the outage of a mobile provider  could have cascading consequences on other critical services and therefore everyday life of large  part of the population.  2.1 Penetration and adoption of mobile communications  Penetration of mobile electronic communications is high in all EU countries and the number of  mobile SIM cards in use has exceeded 100% of the population in all EU Member States (see Figure  1). Mobile connections are expected to continue growing in the coming years, while at the same  time fixed line connections are expected to decrease in most EU countries (see Figure 2).

According to surveys, mobiles phone users want to check their phones about every 6 minutes and  some check it up to 150 times per day6. With the adoption of smartphones, use of mobile  communications will continue to increase as smartphones offer many new attractive features and  services for users. In 2017, smartphones are expected to account for about 90% of all mobile phones  (see figure 3).  Figure 5: Types of mobile phones in Europe 7  2.2 Machine to Machine  Besides consumer usage, electronic communications are also used in Machine-to-Machine (M2M)  communications, where two systems exchange data without human intervention. Mobile Machine- to-Machine communications can rely on 2G/2.5G/3G/3.5G/4G networks. They are used in public  utilities, automotive, consumer electronics, healthcare, security, smart metering (electricity meters),  RMAC (remote monitoring automation and control) telemetry applications, “track and trace,” with  mobile connectivity not integrated directly into a car, POS/payment and ATMs. Considering that this  technology represents one of the core components of the development of smart city they are one  critical point of failure.  Depending 2G/2.5G/3G/3.5G/4G the outage of a mobile provider could have  cascading consequences on other critical services and therefore everyday life of large part of the  population.  5Based on Ovum (2012), Mobile Regional and Country Forecast: 2012–17, Telco Strategy  6 Spencer B, (2013), Mobile users can't leave their phone alone for six minutes and check it up to 150 times a day, Daily Mail  http://www.dailymail.co.ukhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk viewed on 02/07/13  7 Based on Ovum (2013), Mobile Phone and Smartphone Forecast 2013–2017, Devices and platform  1.106.996  260.004  240.000  250.000  260.000  270.000  280.000  290.000  950.000  1.000.000  1.050.000  1.100.000  1.150.000  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017  Total mobile connections (000s) Total fixed voice lines (000s)  0  200.000  400.000  600.000  800.000  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017  Active Smartphones Active feature phones  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  6  2.3 Mobile network access at the home operator  Mobile communications permeate our reality and in order to start discussing organizational and  technical challenges there follows an overview of the components in a mobile network. It is shown  how normally a customer connects to his/her operator, and how a telephone call is set up8.  Note that this is an abstract and generalized picture. Network architectures and communication  technology is constantly changing and differs from one provider to the other. We briefly describe the  steps, introducing the main components of the mobile network.  Suppose a subscriber turns on his/her mobile device  and wants to make a telephone call:  1. The mobile device (of the subscriber) finds a  mobile base station (BTS) in reach and  requests the base station to connect. The  device sends the International Mobile  Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of his/her Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) card to the base station.  In addition, the device requests for a location  registration in order to use mobile services.  2. The base station (BTS) forwards the request to  a base station controller (BSC), and finally to  the mobile switching centres (MSC).  3. The MSC authenticates the device with the  IMSI of the SIM, and checks if the user can  connect and what services are available to the  user, by checking if IMSI is in the HLR (Home  Location Register). This is called the IMSI  attach procedure. In a next step the MSC  checks the kind of services available to the  user (the credit, etc.). If all is well, the location  registration request is accepted.  In this example the mobile device was connecting to a base station of its own operator, also  called home-operator.  Dealing with networks of multiple operators in automatic or manual modes  In practice in most EU countries, most areas are covered by the base stations of several operators. It  may even be the case that (temporarily) the mobile device is out of range of the home network, and  only in range of other networks. In this case, the device tries to select a more suitable network and  to request for a location registration on the visited network.  There are two modes for network selection: automatic and manual. In both cases, the device relies  on information directly stored in the SIM card:  8 GSMA (2012),Mobile Infrastructure Sharing  BSC  BTS  BSC  BTS  BTS  BTS  BTS  MSC  AuC  EIR VLR  HLR  Billing  gateway  Interconnection to other operators  Access network  Mobile  device  1  2  3  4  5  Figure 6: Connecting to the (home) network  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  7  - Home network and equivalent list including the home operator code (Mobile Country Code  followed the Mobile Network Code) derived from the IMSI or equivalent home operator  networks’ codes if present, in priority order.  - Operator controlled networks list including the codes for networks preferred by the  operator in priority order. The different access technologies for each network are also  reported.  - User controlled networks list including the code for networks preferred by the user in  priority order. The different access technologies for each network are also reported9.  - Forbidden networks list including the codes of networks with access denied to the device  with a reject message.  - Equivalent networks list including list of equivalent networks codes as downloaded by the  actual registered network. This list is replaced for each new location registration procedure.  These networks are equivalent to the current network in the networks selection10 .  In automatic mode, the mobile device scans the spectrum and finds all available networks. The  device then chooses a network in priority order based on the following list:  1. Home network or equivalents list in priority order (e.g. operator with a permanent national  roaming agreement with a tier)  2. User controlled networks list in priority order  3. Operator controlled networks list in priority order  4. Other network with received high quality signal in random order  5. Other networks in order of decreasing signal quality  This means that it requests first to the home network or equivalent as described in the first list. If  none of them are found, the device selects a network in the next list, et cetera. Once a network is  selected, the device sends a location registration request in order to register to this network and  access mobile services.  In manual mode, the device researches and displays all available networks including the networks  present in the forbidden networks list (in opposition to the automatic mode). The networks are  presented to the user in the same priority order as do the automatic mode. Then, the user selects  arbitrary a network from the networks list. Once the user has made a manual selection, the mobile  device sends a location registration request to the network in order to access mobile services from  this selected network11.  The base station forwards the request to the MSC. In case of visited network, the MSC would not  find the IMSI of the visited user in its HLR but can identify the code of the home network thanks to  the IMSI so it can contact the HLR of the home operator. In case there is no roaming agreement  between both operators, the home network answers that the device should never be allowed to  connect to the visited network and the BTS of the visited network sends a reject message in  response to the location registration request (see section 2.3.2). Mobile services are denied and the  mobile device does not connect to the base stations of that operator anymore. The situation is  depicted in Figure 7. In case a roaming agreement has been set up, the device follows the process as  described in the section 2.4.  9 3GPP Organisational Partners (2013), 3rd Generation Partnership Project;Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals;  Characteristics of the  Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application  (release 12)  10 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  11 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  8  Reject messages  There are many different types of reject messages sent in reply to a denied location registration  request12, but they can be summarized in two main categories: hard reject and soft reject. In both  cases, when a mobile device is not allowed to have access to a visited network, because roaming  agreements between the visited and the home operators are not activated, the visited operator  would send back an appropriate Reject Cause Value to let the device continue searching for other  networks.  If the network sends a “hard reject” message (Reject Cause Value = network not allowed), then the  device is not allowed to roam in the visited operator network and is informed that the network is  forbidden. The device then automatically adds the network to a list of “forbidden networks for  roaming” stored in the SIM card. This list is kept even when the device is switched off or when the  SIM card is removed. The device will not be able to connect to this network in automatic mode  anymore. Nevertheless, it could access it in manual mode if the location registration request  becomes successful. Indeed, during manual search, the device shows all the available networks to  the user, even the ones already included in the “forbidden Networks list”13. The user can select again  the same foreign network (which previously sent a hard reject message), and then a new location  registration request is sent and can potentially become positive (for example, in case of ad hoc  roaming activation). This of course means that users of an operator experiencing an outage will not  be able to automatically connect to any visited networks even if national roaming is configured and  authorized, unless they initiate a manual network search on the device.  On the other hand, in case of light error message (“soft reject”) (i.e. not forbidden), the device  continues receiving signals from the foreign networks even if it cannot connect to it. The negative  side of this configuration is a certain level of pollution of signals between antennas and mobile  devices. However, it does not impact quality of service for users or mobile devices’ battery longevity.  In this case only, the device can automatically switch networks at any time if the message becomes  positive. This of course means that, if the home operator experiences a network breakdown and the  visited operator authorizes national roaming for these affected subscribers, devices will  automatically switch to and access the visited network.  12 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  13 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  BTS  BTS BTS  Mobile  device  connect connect  reject accept  Figure 7: Coverage by multiple networks  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  9  2.4 Roaming  Roaming is defined as the use of mobile services from another operator, which is not the home  operator. The most well-known form of roaming is international roaming, which allows users to use  their mobile devices when abroad. National roaming is roaming on networks of operators within the  same country.  This happens in case the user cannot reach a base station of its home-operator, but connects to the  base station of another network (roaming), because for example:   the mobile device is being used abroad   in that area the home operator is not covered by base stations.  We call the network that is not a home network and to which the mobile device tries to connect to a  “visited network”.

The mobile device (of the subscriber – in blue) finds a mobile base station (BTS) of another  operator in reach (the pink components) and requests one of these base stations to connect.  The device sends the IMSI of its SIM to the base station to register. On the device, the  selection of an operator’s network could be either in manual or automatic mode. As  described in the section 2.3.1, mobile device selects a network based on different lists  classified in priority order. In addition, the device requests for a location registration in order  to use mobile services.  2. Like before, the base station (BTS) forwards the request to a base station controller (BCS),  and finally to the mobile switching centre (MSC) of the visited network.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  10  3. The steps are different from this point on:  a. The MSC of the visited operator tries to find the IMSI (of the SIM of the mobile device) in  its network’s HLR. The MSC however does not find it as that IMSI was allocated by a  competitor (the home operator).  b. The MSC uses the IMSI to identify the home network of the SIM (the blue components)  thanks to the Mobile Country Code followed by the Mobile Network Code. If a roaming  agreement exists between the providers, the MSC contacts the home network’s HLR,  authenticates the mobile device and retrieves the relevant parts of the profile of the  subscriber. This data (about the visiting subscriber) is stored in the VLR (Visiting Location  Register) of the visited network. The VLR keeps a temporary profile of the subscriber, for  the purpose of roaming. This is done even before the subscriber starts to consume any  services (idle mode)14.  A mobile device registered on a visited network periodically and automatically attempts to connect  to its home operator network or any other high priority networks (as described in the section 2.3.1)  if on automatic mode. A period is  configured in the SIM card to scan the available networks in a  specific location. The default period used is usually 60 minutes but can be configured from 6 minutes  to 8 hours in 6 minute steps in the SIM. If any higher priority networks are found, the mobile device  stays on the visited network15.  Often, the visited operator charges more than what the home network operator would have  charged. These extra costs are called ‘roaming costs’. Consumer organizations, governments in the  EU and the EC have repeatedly taken legislative steps to reduce roaming costs16 (for example, by  posing hard limits to the price of calls, data, and messages across the EU).  To avoid expensive bills due to inconsiderate consumption of mobile services on a foreign network,  users have the possibility to set up a “do not roam” button, especially for mobile data consumption.  With that set up directly configured in the mobile device, the users cannot consume data when they  are roaming on another network.  14 European Parliament (2006), Technical Issues on Roaming: Transparency, Technical Aspects and Data – Overview related to the  proposed regulation on Roaming  15 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  16  European Parliament and Council (2012), Regulation (Eu) No 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012  on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  11  3 Existing national roaming schemes  International roaming is perhaps the most well-known type of roaming, but also national roaming is  quite common. In this section we give a brief overview of existing national roaming schemes. The  overview is the result of the desktop research and interviews with all the different stakeholders.  3.1 Types of roaming schemes  We summarize hereunder the different types of national roaming schemes, used in the EU, and  outside the EU.  MVNO - Mobile Virtual  Network Operator  A MVNO is a virtual operator which does not own a mobile access  network. The MVNO has an agreement with another operator, to allow  its customers to access the mobile network and consume mobile  services17.  New entrants This national roaming scheme aims to facilitate new entrants in the  market – with the goal to improve competition. The new entrant makes  a national roaming agreement to have an immediate full geographic  coverage without high initial investments18. Such agreements are usually  temporary.  A common situation is to allow new 3G licensees to temporary use the  2G network of existing operators during the time it is rolling out its own  infrastructure19.  Note that Article 12 1(g) of the Access Directive (2002/19/EC) provides a  legal framework for imposing national roaming obligations to operators  with a significant market power in order to improve and stimulate  competition in the market.  France represents an example of this scheme.  Coverage of rural areas In this scheme a provider extends its coverage to scarcely populated  (rural) areas using a national roaming agreement. This national roaming  scheme aims to facilitate smaller operators who may not be able to  sustain the costs of covering a large territory with a low density of  population20.  Note that Article 4 of the directive No 128/1999/EC provides a legal  framework for this: “Member States may, where necessary, take action,  in accordance with Community law, to ensure the coverage of less- populated areas”21.  17 Sutherland E.

Regional licenses In countries with regional licenses, national roaming can be used by  operators to offer services in other regions. This allows smaller operators  to provide a national service, without actually covering the entire  country22. This situation is seen, for instance, in large countries like India  where the market is divided in regions/states.  In flight/at sea mobile  services  Some operators provide roaming services to allow customers to use  mobile services in flight or at sea, 23  for instance using roaming  agreements with satellite communications providers.  Emergency roaming The roaming agreement can be used for resilience purpose, supporting  the traffic of customers affected by an outage. Different schemes can be  implemented and are described in more detailed in the section 5.  Sweden, USA and Caribbean are good examples of different schemes of  national roaming for resilience purpose.  22 Sutherland E. (2011), The regulation of national roaming, International Telecommunications Society, 18-21 September 2011, Budapest,  p.2  23 Sutherland E.

Sometimes national  roaming is implemented on a voluntary basis between providers (as part of business agreements),  without intervention or request from the NRA. We summarized the findings of the research in Figure  9 where the different implementations of national roaming are represented. Note that we did not  find information or receive feedback about all EU countries, so this overview may be incomplete and  it represents only if national roaming is obliged by the NRA or allowed for commercial purposes.  NR required by NRA  NR allowed but not required  Figure 9: Existing national roaming implementations in the EU  Austria  In Austria, operators owning a 2G network are obliged to provide national roaming to operators  which enter the market with a 3G license without the need for deploying also a 2G infrastructure.  This type of national roaming can be used for a maximum duration of four years, and the 3G  licensees have to cover at least 20% of the population. The roaming obligation only covers roaming  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  14  on 2G network to 3G operators (i.e. not 3G-to-3G for example)24. The goal of this scheme is to  facilitate the entrance of 3G operators.  Czech republic  In the Czech Republic, the Electronic Communications Act does not require national roaming. Also  the national regulatory authority does not require national roaming to mobile operators although it  is possible to provide it on a commercial basis (common agreement). A change should occur in 2014,  after the completion of the auction for mobile frequencies.  Croatia  According to the Croatian Electronic Communication Act, all operators must provide access to their  networks. In 2005, Tele2 (3rd operator) signed a roaming agreement with Vipnet to ensure that,  upon its launch, its customers would have access to a network with national coverage which was in  force until 2008 when Tele2 signed a contract with HT. All terms are commercially agreed (in both  cases).  Denmark  According to the Danish law, all operators must provide access to their networks. With such scheme,  the Danish NRA aims at promoting the access of new entrants and particularly MVNO in order to  24 Ovum (2012), Country Regulation Overview – Austria  25 GSMA Intelligence(2013), Data Dashboard  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ viewed on 01/07/2013  26 GSMA Intelligence(2013), Data Dashboard  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ viewed on 01/07/2013  Austria (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  8,4M  13,4M 159% 3  Czech Republic (Q4 2012)25  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  10,5M  13,8M  138%  3  Croatia (Q4 2012)26  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  4,8M  6M 116% 3  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ https://gsmaintelligence.com/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  15  stimulate market competition27. In 2003, 3 Denmark signed a roaming agreement with TDC to  ensure that, upon its launch, its customers would have access to a network with national coverage.  Finland  In Finland, similarly, the Telecommunications Market Act was amended in 2001 to oblige 2G  licensees with significant market share to provide national roaming to 3G operators, covering a  minimum of 20% of the population. Furthermore, in 2006, the act was again amended to be more  general and applicable to all mobile network technologies to oblige all mobile operators with  significant market power to agree on national roaming with other operators upon request28.  France  In France, a recent entrant (i.e. Free/Iliad) made a national roaming agreement with the incumbent  operator Orange France in 2012 while building out its own infrastructure. In France, 2G national  roaming is enforced by the regulator, but the 3G agreement is based on commercial arrangement  between operators. To benefit from the 2G national roaming, Free had to cover a least 25% of the  population with 3G technology. This temporary agreement should be terminated by 201629.  Italy  In Italy national roaming is enforced by the NRA. New entrants have the opportunity to request  national roaming agreements from existing operators for a period up to 18 months.

Ireland  In Ireland, like in Austria, national roaming is mandatory for operators of 2G networks, and must be  offered to 3G operators covering 20% of the population. This agreement is in principle based on  commercial negotiations. In case of non-agreement, the regulator may set the prices based on the  retail price minus any avoidable costs32. In Ireland, two new entrants, Meteor and 3, successfully  concluded national agreements with established operators in 200533.  Poland  In Poland, operators are not obliged to offer national roaming, but it is allowed by the NRA. Indeed,  new entrants have had the opportunity to conclude national roaming agreements with existing  operators34. For example, Polish telecom P4 made a national roaming agreement with Polska  Telefonia Cyfrowa in 2012 to reduce gaps network coverage. This operator already concluded similar  deals with other operators in the past for the same purpose35.  30 Ovum (2013), Country Regulation Overview - Italy  31 GSMA Intelligence(2013), Data Dashboard  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ viewed on 01/07/2013  32 Ovum (2012), Country Regulation Overview - Ireland  33 Sutherland E.

The scheme is based on voluntary agreements between the operators (i.e.  Telenor, Tele2, TeliaSonera and Tree), and regards a limited number of SIM cards (4,000) to roam  nationally. A detailed overview on the solution is provided in chapter 5.3.  Spain  In Spain several operators have entered into national roaming agreements over the past years. In  2008 Yoigo concluded a five-year agreement with Telefonica Espana as well as with Orange Spain, in  order to extend its 2G and 3G coverage to areas not yet covered by its own network36.  The Netherlands  Following the outage of Vodafone in 2012, the Netherlands searched for a resilience solution in case  of an operator outage. As a result, the three operators (Vodafone, KPN and T-Mobile) have  concluded regional roaming agreements that would allow each two providers to temporary serve  the third provider’s customers in case of an outage. The coverage will not be necessarily national as  the agreement could enter into force for a specific region of the country only.  A detailed overview  of the solution is provided in chapter 5.2.  36 Ovum (2012), Mobile Network Sharing Deals Analyzer: 2H11–1H12, Telco Strategy  Sweden (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  9,5M  14,8M 156% 6  Spain (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  46,9M  53,2M 113% 4  Netherlands (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  16.7M  19.9M 119%  4  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  18  3.3 National roaming outside the EU  Australia  National roaming is allowed in Australia to extend the coverage of an operator in the countryside.  Vodafone Australia provides this service to its customers on demand37. The principle is that if  Vodafone’s customers want to use their mobile communications services in the rural areas of  Victoria and Tasmania, outside the coverage of their home operator, they have the possibility to  contact the customer centre to activate the national roaming service. In this case, customers roam  on the network of Telstra as soon as the network of Vodafone is not available in the specified areas.  The switch of networks is automatic unless the customer is already on a call. In this last scenario, the  call drops and the user has to redial the number from the Telstra’s network.  India  The Indian telecommunications sector is split according to the 22 circles of India and most of the  Indian operators have only local or regional licenses to operate mobile services. In this context,  roaming represents a way to provide mobile services at national level (i.e. in all circles). This kind of  roaming is called inter-circle roaming and is currently in the process of being regulated on prices by  the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)38. Each circle acts as a separate country/region  which makes the comparison with national roaming. Nevertheless, there are some cases of intra- circle roaming which can be associated to national roaming: a customer of an operator can use the  network of a competitor operating in the same circle. This type of intra-circle roaming has primarily  been implemented to improve operator's coverage inside circles where they do not have strong  network.  USA  In 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted an order to ensure that customers  have access to mobile Internet anywhere the service is technically available39.  37 Vodafone Australia, National roaming, http://www.vodafone.com.au/personal/services/coverage/nationalroaming viewed on  08/08/2013  38 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (2013), Consultation Paper on review of Tariff for National Roaming, New Delhi  39 Goldman D.

This completes the existing framework on national  roaming for voice services. Indeed, the national authority already requested operators to conclude  voice national roaming agreements for the first time in 1981. In 2007, the FCC strengthened its  position arguing that mobile providers need to provide voice roaming automatically.  In addition, USA has experienced some sorts of emergency national roaming. Such agreement was  introduced ad hoc in 2012 between AT&T and T-Mobile for areas heavily impacted by Hurricane  Sandy in New York and New Jersey. Customers were authorized to make calls in those areas on the  network which was the most operational, whichever the network was a home or a visited network.  This means that the switch of network was automatic, based on the best signals. This service was not  differently charged to the customers but followed the existing rate plans40.  Caribbean  In addition to USA, Caribbean has implemented emergency roaming agreements ad-hoc. Beginning  of 2013, CCT experienced an important outage, requesting the support of its competitors Digicel.  During more than 7 days, Digicel hosted both prepaid and post-paid customers of CCT without any  changes of tariff plans for them. They were able to make national and international calls while also  using their data services. CCT customers were requested to select the Digicel network thanks to the  manual mode of their device41.  40 Berry Review (2012), AT&T & T-Mobile Enter Into Emergency Roaming Agreement for Hurricane Sandy,  http://www.berryreview.com/2012/10/31/att-t-mobile-enter-into-emergency-roaming-agreement-for-hurricane-sandy/ viewed on the  09/08/2013  41  BVI Platinum (2013), CCT Network Woes Continue; Digicel/CCT Reach New Roaming Agreement,  http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=Article&articleID=1357663206 viewed on 08/08/2013  USA (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  317.1M  347.2M 109%  12  Virgin Island (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  23,816  28,696 120%  3  http://www.berryreview.com/2012/10/31/att-t-mobile-enter-into-emergency-roaming-agreement-for-hurricane-sandy/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  20  4 Limitations and challenges  We interviewed a number of experts from regulators and the telecommunications industry players,  asking them about their views on and experiences with national roaming. Some of the regulators we  interviewed had already some experience with national roaming in the past (e.g. Austria, Finland,  and Italy). Others currently have national roaming schemes in place (e.g. France, Sweden), or have  researched it in the past. We show which regulators were interviewed in the map below (cf. figure  10). In addition, we interviewed four mobile network providers who have been involved in national  roaming in France, in the Netherlands and in India (where national roaming is a regional matter). In  total hence we interviewed experts from 22 different organizations.  Figure 10: Interviews of regulators  In this section we summarize the issues that were raised and discussed in these interviews.  4.1 Limitations  In the course of this study a number of experts pointed us to the limitations of national roaming for  resilience purpose. It is clear that a number of outages cannot be addressed with national roaming.  In this section we try to underline all the major limitations that can be seen as a starting point for  future areas of research.  Outages affecting all providers in the country  Outages affecting all providers at once cannot be mitigated using roaming. For example, power cuts  usually affect all the providers in a geographic area at the same time. Similarly, natural disasters  might affect several providers at once.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  21  Outages affecting the home HLR  To set up a roaming call the VLR of the visited network and the HLR of the home network must  communicate with each other (via the MSCs) to authenticate the SIM of the mobile device (see  Section 2.4). National roaming cannot be used if the HLR of the home network is unreachable by the  visited operator. This means for example that failures of the HLR (a common cause of outages)  cannot be mitigated by roaming.  Similarly, the IN (Intelligent Network) of the home operator is needed to allow prepaid subscribers  to make calls. In case of IN or MSC breakdown, the visiting network is not able to check the profile  and balance of the visiting subscribers.  In 2012, Orange France and O2 UK mobile networks were separately affected by a core network  breakdown impacting millions of customers. In both cases, the HLR generated multiple error  messages creating an oversaturation of signals and leading the core network to crash. A similar case  appeared in the USA as well in 2011, impacting Verizon42.  Outages affecting shared infrastructure  There are settings where the access network is shared by several operators. For example, in certain  remote areas this may be used to share and reduce high costs of covering areas with low density of  subscribers. In these settings, an outage in the access network would affect several providers at  once. National roaming would not work to mitigate such an outage.  Overloads  National roaming can be a solution if other network providers are up and running and able to deal  with the traffic of the roaming devices. This means, as mentioned in the introduction, that in crises  situations where there is a high traffic overload on all providers, roaming is not a solution. A recent  example is when in 2013, operators in the centre of Boston experienced a big congestion of network  during the annual marathon due to high calls volume following the panic caused by the bombs  explosion43. The unavailability of mobile networks caused more panic, which made the work of  emergency services more difficult. National roaming, however, would not be a solution for this kind  of outage.  4.2 Challenges  During the interviews experts raised a number of challenges that should be addressed.  Overload of the visited network  If during an outage mobile devices are allowed to roam on other networks, this could cause an  overload or a reduced quality of service for the original subscribers of the visited network. As a way  to address this, providers offering roaming could configure restrictions and prioritize their own  customers, in order to keep an acceptable level of quality for their subscribers.  Competition  National roaming could negatively impact competition, and remove incentives for providers to offer  resilient and redundant networks. By allowing national roaming, one might create a “race to the  bottom”, where no provider has an incentive to provide resilient networks anymore – because it is  42  Fitchard, K. (JUL. 13, 2012), Why are mobile networks dropping like flies? Gigaom viewed on 01/07/2013  Why are mobile networks dropping like flies? Gigaom  http://gigaom.com/author/kfitchard/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  22  easy to back up on the networks of others during an outage. Interestingly, national roaming is often  used in the EU to actually improve competition (new entrant’s scheme e.g.).  One way to address these concerns would be to restrict national roaming to specific circumstances,  in order to deal with severe outages. Another way would be to ensure that the operator suffering  the outage actually bares additional costs for using the other networks (say intra-provider roaming  costs), so as to create an incentive for the operator to prevent outages in the future.  Set up costs  The implementation of national roaming could require (too) large investments by the providers. As a  way to address this, operators could leverage on existing international roaming infrastructure. In  other words, by technically mimicking international roaming as much as possible, the technical  investments needed should be limited.  Roaming costs  It is common practice for providers to charge roaming subscribers higher fees for international  roaming44. Also in national roaming, visited providers could be charging higher fees for the roaming  service. To transfer these costs to the subscriber would seem more complicated, however, in the  case of national roaming. Subscriber must be made aware there is an outage and asked to opt-in to  higher costs. This does not seem very feasible to organize for large numbers of users. At the same  time it would probably anger most consumers if the on top of the outage they are offered the same  services they paid but now for a higher price.  Triggering roaming  National roaming is considered a kind of last-resort solutions. The Dutch regulator, for example, has  agreed with operators to enable national roaming when it is expected that an outage will affect  500,000 customers affected and the network recovery time is expected to be longer than three days.  This however raises another issue. How can operators know if an outage will last a long time?  Providers might underestimate the time needed for recovery. During the outage in the Netherlands,  for example, the provider repeatedly said it expected to restore service in a matter of hours. But in  the end the incident lasted more than several days. One solution could be to use a more objective  parameter for triggering roaming: for example, the duration (until now). For example, the trigger  could be, if an incident lasts more than 12 hours, then national roaming should be enabled.  Voluntary or regulated  It is not clear whether the NRA has a legal mandate to oblige providers to engage in national  roaming agreements for the purpose of resilience. According to article 13a, EU Member States shall  ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks take all appropriate steps to  guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services  provided over those networks45.  One could argue that national roaming is a step to guarantee resilience. One could also argue that  the NRA should just set high-level resilience requirements, and that it is up to the provider to  44 This practice is often severely criticized by EU governments and the EC and stands to finish soon.  45 European Parliament and Council (2009), DIRECTIVE 2009/140/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25  November 2009 amending Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC  on the authorization of electronic communications networks and services  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  23  determine what are appropriate steps, and whether or not national roaming agreements could be  helpful in case of large outages.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  24  5 Technical solutions for mitigating mobile network outages  In this section we provide 5 different options for NRAs, based on the input we received from experts  from industry and regulators. For each option we list the pros and cons, and we discuss the main  challenges.

The NRA only raises awareness with subscribers (particularly subscribers in critical sectors)  about the importance of backup and failover solutions; ways to mitigate outages of their own  provider, including:  Figure 11: Current situation in Europe of implementation of  National Roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  25   Dual or backup SIMs: subscribing to mobile communications services with more than  one provider allows the customer to spread the risk across two or more providers.   Foreign SIMs: foreign providers have roaming agreement with more than one  operator in almost every country. In that sense, an international card allows the user  to use more than one network.   Other mobile communication services as Wi-Fi, satellite, radio, et cetera.  Technical set up and cost structure  This approach does not require any specific technical set up. In addition, the cost is totally supported  by the customers who ensure themself in case of outage. This approach is individual and depends on  each customer.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage of this approach is that it does not require any investments or legal agreements.  The approach is individual and depends on each customer which agrees to support their own  additional costs to insure him against the negative impact of an outage.  The main disadvantage is that the above-mentioned options are usually cumbersome for consumers:   With dual SIMs users should keep track of two telephone numbers for the important  contacts.   SIM from a foreign country would be too costly to use continuously. In addition,  foreign SIM card could be able to roam on specific providers’ networks with which  the home operator has concluded an international roaming agreement. There is no  way to prevent these specific operators to be affected. Lastly, some countries  impose customers to have a billing address in the country before subscribing to  mobile services so it would be difficult to acquire such a SIM card.   Other identified communications services do not represent a complete alternative:  Satellite telephony is too expensive to use continuously while Wi-Fi allows only a  sedentary use of the services. Wi-Fi could be associated to fixed communications  services more than a substitute to mobile services.  5.2 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection  As for the above mentioned solution, it is possible to activate national roaming, ad-hoc, leaving at  the customer level the decision to use or not this service thanks to the manual network selection.  The Netherlands is a similar example of this solution.  Technical set up  This ad hoc activation of national roaming can be configured according to two different models  already presented in the previous scheme. The only difference in this case is that the customer  manually selects the network to roam to. In that sense, the user is aware of the roaming service.  However, we cannot consider the manual registration alone as consent from the customer to pay  additional fees, if any. It is necessary to notify the users about the additional fees of national  roaming with clear messages (e.g. sms as for international roaming).  To allow only a manual selection of the network it is important to set up hard reject message with  network forbidden. In this case only the network is stored in the forbidden list included in the SIM  card and can only be selected manually by the user.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  26  In both cases described above, national roaming can be authorized by the visited operator at  national level or according to Location Area Code (i.e. LAC) in order to target the zones affected.  Cost structure  Costs could be billed in the commercial agreement between the providers who enable this  capability: pre-agree lump sum or on a reciprocal basis as described in the previous schemes.  Roaming costs, as a VAS, could be supported by the subscribers who manually select the roaming  network. They acknowledge the national roaming capability and related costs. However, as  described in the technical set up, the manual selection of a hosting network does not represent a  valid consent of the customer to support extra costs. In this sense, clear message are necessary to  raise the awareness about the additional costs.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage is the range of customers who can enjoy the continuous service. Every  customer can manually switch between networks in case the home operator’s network is not  available during an outage. The costs of this solution could be directly charged to the customers as  they manually activate the service and received a clear message informing them about the extra  costs they are subject to in case of national roaming. In that sense, they are aware that national  roaming is a VAS. This creates important incentives for the providers to deploy this solution.  The main disadvantage and challenge is the possible breaches in the market competition. It could  potentially decrease the willingness of operators to deploy a resilient network. Indeed, it is easier to  carry on the networks of competitors during an outage, especially if the costs are supported by the  customers. As a consequence, it is important to set up different thresholds in terms of number of  subscribers impacted, location areas impacted, expected duration of the outage, etc. according to  which the solution will be activate to allow the providers to use this service only in case of serious  incidents.  In addition, an important popularity of this scheme could cause an overload and threaten the service  quality for original subscribers of the visited network. However, the configuration per LAC, ranges of  classes of IMSIs allows a smaller negative impact on service quality for the visited operator’s  customers. The visited network has only to support the users communicating in the areas affected  by the network breakdown.  Lastly, this solution does not represent the most appropriate solution for Machine-to-Machine  communication. Indeed, with a manual solution, the SIM cards in the machine will not be able to  switch networks without a human intervention, which is not possible in most cases.  All things concerned, this solution can benefit to the entire society which has the choice to opt-in or  not. A threshold is necessary to avoid any abuses.  Netherlands - an example of implementation  Following the outage of Vodafone in 2012, the Netherlands searched for a resilience solution in case  of an operator outage. As a result, the three operators (Vodafone, KPN and T-Mobile) have concluded  regional roaming agreements that would allow each two providers to temporary serve the third  provider’s customers in case of an outage. The coverage will not be necessarily national as the  agreement could enter into force for a specific region of the country only.  General set up:  In case of important outage, affecting more people than the predefined thresholds (500,000  customers affected and the network recovery time is expected to be longer than three days), national  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  27  roaming agreements are used to provide primary post-paid services (Voice and SMS) to customers.  According to the exceeding of the thresholds and in concert with the partner operator this solution  can be activated without the involvement of the NRA in the process  Other services (machine to machine, data) are not included due to the possible waterfall effect and  the viable alternatives. For example hosting of rescued customers could impact the network of the  hosted operator. A national survey is currently being conducted regarding critical infrastructures  communications to identify interdependencies, assess impacts and find (technical) solutions.  For  data, Wi-Fi is currently considered as an alternative. This is due to the large volume of traffic of  mobile connectivity where roaming of data will most likely quickly overload the visited network. For  this reason data connectivity should be backed up by other means such free public Wi-Fi and fixed  broadband connections that can be made available in the affected area.  Two operators take over the traffic of the third operator experiencing an outage. The quality of  service for other users (from the helping operators) is closely monitored. Operators have their own  SLAs with their customers, based on KPIs. To be able to take over more traffic from the guest  operator, these key performance indicators can be lowered by the helping operators. Operators have  defined together a minimal level as a maximum to lower their KPIs during RR. However, in case a  critical level is reached in the network, each operator has the right to stop hosting foreign customers.  Technical set up:  National roaming is forbidden in the Netherlands. As a consequence, the international roaming  infrastructure cannot be used and a dedicated infrastructure is set up to support this scheme.  Furthermore, this solution is only possible in case of access network breakdown and not in case of  core network breakdown.  In order to use this service the customers need to manually select the new network on their device.  Since the migration of users is done in different batches of IMSIs, they may have to try several times  until they successfully connect to a foreign network, depending on whether they are part of the  already migrated batch of IMSIs or not. Once they return on an area covered by their home network,  users are switched automatically to their home network.  All the operators’ websites, customer support as well as employees are responsible for raising  customers’ awareness on what actions need to be taken in case of outage.  Costs:  Costs for traffic handling during the activation period will be charged based on the European  roaming tariffs. In case the regular KPIs of the host operator will be lowered to enable handling more  traffic of the guest operator, the host operator runs the risk of breaking SLA agreements with its own  customers. Negotiations for reimbursements of related penalties or claims are underway between  the wholesale departments of the operators. Those negotiations are done separately between each  two operators under confidentiality (Chinese wall) to ensure that competition will not be breached.  5.3 Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards  In this third approach national roaming works only for a specific set of SIMs (or a specific number  range) controlled both in terms of users and usage by the NRA. These specific SIM cards are  distributed by the NRA at the beginning of the outage to targeted users identified with a national  risk assessment and need to be retrieved or deactivated as soon as the network affected by the  outage is recovered. This strong control by the NRA avoids abuses and uses outside the scope of  resilience. The regulator is responsible for distributing the SIM and decides if it should be activate  depending on the expected impact of the outage.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  28  This scheme could be promoted by the NRA but voluntary agreed by providers, or totally obliged by  the NRA. The costs for the extra service (the possibility to roam) are paid by the NRAs or the  operators depending on the agreement.  Technical set up  The scheme requires specific SIM cards capable to have more than one home operator. In that  sense, they should be set up and registered in the HLR of every provider included in the roaming  agreement. This technical specificity ensures the efficiency of the roaming scheme during extended  types of outage, including HLR breakdown. Operators’ networks are flagged as equivalent home  operators’ network in the SIM card which allows the selection of any of those in manual or  automatic mode. As they all have the same priority, the stronger signal determines the network to  select.  No reject messages are needed in this case.  Cost structure  Even if the scheme leverages on the existing infrastructure, it requires the development and the  implementation of specific SIM cards capable to have more than one home operator. In addition, it  requires some organizational costs regarding the definition of the commercial agreement between  operators and the administration of the designated SIMs. Indeed, SIMs cards need to be distributed  by emergency centres during the outage which creates distribution and storage costs. These costs  can be supported by the regulator or by the operators depending on the agreement.  Costs of usage need to be supported by the operator affected by the outage in order to keep their  willingness to have a resilient infrastructure.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage of this scheme is the very limited impact on competition. As this service is  highly controlled by the NRA, the risks of abuses or uses of services outside the scope of resilience  are very low. In addition, as the cost of use is supported by the providers affecting by the outage, it  does not decrease their willingness to invest in a resilient network.  In addition, national roaming for a fixed range of SIMs decreases significantly the risks of network  congestion for the hosting operator. Depending on the number of emergency SIMs, it does not  require any increase of capacity and does not strengthen the quality of service for other customers.  The main disadvantage of the scheme is the limited benefit for customers. Only a limited number of  specific customers (mainly vital public functions) are insured against the impact of an outage and can  use a continuous mobile service. These customers are chosen by the NRAS which controls the  distribution of SIM cards.  In addition, the organizational burdens are quite important: emergency centres need to be  implemented to control and distributed the SIMs in case of outage. It represents the main challenge  of this solution: being able to distribute the SIMs card timely and efficiency to guarantee a limited  breach of mobile communications services.  All in all, it represents a pure solution of resilience, targeted only public vital functions.  Sweden - an example of implementation  In Sweden, the regulator (PTS) has implemented an emergency roaming scheme since 2008. The  scheme is based on voluntary agreements between the operators (i.e. Telenor, Tele2, TeliaSonera  and Tree), and regards a limited number of SIM cards (4,000) to roam nationally.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  29  These 4,000 SIM cards are called emergency SIM cards and are distributed beforehand to specific  crisis centres for use only in case of serious disruption of electronic services or communication  networks. That disruption could be the breakdown of multiples operators with a long expected time  to restore the infrastructure. The regulator decides whether the emergency roaming cards should be  used or not, following requests from the county administrative board concerned by an outage. If the  regulator agrees then the SIM cards are distributed to those parties. The use of these cards is  restricted to vital public functions chosen by the NRA. This means that SIMs are not always available  to targeted customers but highly controlled by the regulator. Once the networks of affected  operators are restored, SIM cards are returned to the crisis centre. The use is only allowed for a  specific period of time.  The user of these specific emergency SIM cards can automatically connect to any available networks,  depending on the quality of signals.  PTS has financed the implementation of this scheme as well as the acquisition of SIM cards, together  with subscriptions. However, the operators have to support the costs associated with their use. If  such costs should become unreasonably expensive for an individual operator, the regulator shall  compensate the operator46.  5.4 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection  A fourth technical solution is the ad hoc activation of national roaming, only in specific geographic  areas affected by the outage, relying on the automatic network selection mode on the customers’  phones or classes of IMSIs  The USA is a similar example of this solution.  Technical set up  This ad hoc activation of national roaming can be configured according to two different models:   National roaming is configured but not authorized in neither the home operator’s HLR or on  the visited network’s HLR. When the home operator experiences a network breakdown,  national roaming is authorized in the core networks of both parties.   National roaming is configured and authorized in the home operator’s HLR but not  authorized in the visited network. In case of outage, the visited network authorizes the  national roaming for affected users in order to immediately activate the resilience service.  Of course, in this last case, the visited operator would have to configure specific Reject Cause Value  messages, in order not to allow national roaming in case there is no incident. As the scheme needs  to work on automatic network selection mode, light reject messages would need to be used. Indeed,  with light reject messages, the concerned network does not enter into the forbidden networks list  which allows the user to automatically switch to this network in case the location registration  request becomes positive (only in case of outage).The Reject Cause Value messages are described in  the section 2.3.2.  In both cases described above, national roaming can be authorized by the visited operator at  national level or according to Location Area Code (i.e. LAC) or ranges/classes of IMSIs In this last  46 PTS (2008), Facts about emergency roaming  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  30  scenario, national roaming is only activated for the specific geographic area affected by the outage.  LACs are configured directly in the core network of an operator and can be defined according to  geographic areas, number of users, and group of antennas or specific technical features (e.g. an area  covering a railway line).  Cost structure  Costs are billed as defined in the commercial agreement between the providers who enable this  capability. It can be a pre-agreed lump sum with the amount calculated in advance based on  patterns or on a reciprocal basis where both operators (home and visited) calculate the traffic  generated during the outage and the visited network charges the home operator based on some  pre-agreed price per minute.  As the service is automatic for customers, they are not required to take any action to switch  operators which means that they could not be aware of the change of operators’ network. For that  reason, customers are charged according to their actual tariff plan as they would have made a call on  their home network.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main benefit of this approach is the assistance to the entire society affected by the outage:  every customer affected switches automatically to another network in case of outage of their home  operator. This benefit comes without any extra cost to the customer.  However, as a challenge, the visited network has to support an important additional traffic. This  peak of traffic could potentially affect the quality of service for the hosting customers. At the  extreme, it could potentially create a congestion of network for the hosting operator  Nevertheless as national roaming is configured by LAC it allows a smaller negative impact on service  quality for the entire visited operator’s base of customers. The visited network has only to support  the users communicating in the areas affected by the network breakdown. As a result, it keeps the  negative impact of national roaming concentrated in the area affected by the outage.  Lastly, there is a challenge, especially for NRA, to stimulate the operators to conclude such  agreements. Indeed, even if they can use the existing international roaming infrastructure (with  slightly adapted capacity), the variable costs to support can decrease their incentives to agree on  this scheme.  Nevertheless, the working costs avoid any abuses and keep the incentives of operators to develop a  resilient and redundant network. Indeed, more resilient is the network, less probable operator  would have to appeal to this service.  All in all, this resilient solution is beneficial for the entire society without additional costs for  customers. NRA has an important role to play to promote it and stimulate the operators to engage  with each other to deploy such a scheme despite their possible important costs.  5.5 Roaming permanently activated by the customer  A second extreme approach to implement national roaming is to set it up permanently between two  or more operators. This approach is similar to the international roaming: at any time customers can  access the network of another operator which has signed a national roaming agreement with their  home operator in order to use mobile communication services. However, this service needs to be  activated by the customer and is subject to additional fees.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  31  Australia is the main example of this solution even if the purpose is different in that case (extend  coverage in rural areas).  Technical set up  The device connects in priority to its home operator’s network to avoid unnecessary costs. In case  the network of its home operator is not available, it connects to the second priority network which is  the network of the operator which has concluded a national roaming agreement with the home  operator. The home operator directly sets up the priority networks in the SIM card of its users.  No reject messages are required if the services has been activated by the customer as the roaming is  permanently activated.  This set up works in both automatic and manual mode, depending on the user’s preferences.  Cost structure  Costs are billed as defined in the commercial agreement between the providers who enable this  capability. In a pre-agreed lump sum, the operators calculate in advance an amount of money to be  paid. This amount can be accurately calculated beforehand by well know patterns of traffic for each  region and time. As long as that amount is set, then the disrupted operator pays the visited operator  that amount after the incident has been resolved. Alternatively, the operators could agree to settle  the invoice, based on a reciprocal basis, i.e. they both calculate the traffic generated during the  outage and the visited network charges the home operator based on some pre-agreed price per  minute.  This service, as a VAS, is supported by the subscribers who request it. The billing method is in line  with the international roaming service.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage is the large ranges of customers who can benefit from this value added service.  Indeed, national roaming is always enabled and the customer who wants to ensure a continuous  service is in charge of the opt-in and supports the additional costs.  The main disadvantage and challenge is the probable breaches in the market competition. In this  scheme the operators are basically federating their networks. This is a highly regulated area by the  EU and should be considered only in very specific scenarios for a limited time. The incentives to  develop a complete and resilient network can be impacted as user can always choose to which  network to roam even besides outages. It also means that operators have less control over the  traffic and users on their networks. As a consequence, it is important to set up disruptive fees to  avoid users to usually roam on competitors’ networks.  In addition, an important popularity of this scheme could cause an overload and threaten the service  quality for original subscribers of the visited network. Nevertheless, operators could configure  restrictions and prioritize their own customers.  All things concerned, this solution can be easily used out of the scope of resilience by the users.  Abuses can easily appear and the threat of competition breaches is important. As a consequence,  this solution is not advised by ENISA.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  32  6 Recommendations  In the following recommendations section, you can find a set of actions that could need to be  taken to ensure an appropriate level of resilience in electronic mobile communications in your  country and be prepared in case of large scale outage.  Recommendation 1:  Discuss portfolio of solutions offered  ENISA is aware that each Member State has a different regulatory approach and telecom  market. For these reasons this report presents a portfolio of solutions that can be applied based  on the different markets and regulations:   No roaming   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection   Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection   Roaming permanently activated by the customer  Member States are invited to use this as a starting point for the discussion of national roaming  as a resilience solution with the mobile telecom operators. In this way they can use these  options as a basis to tailor their own solution taking into consideration their own legal  constraints and needs and agreements among operators. Competent authorities should discuss  them with the operators so that national, technical and legal constrains are clear and make sure that  operators are aware of the different technical options in case of need.  It is important to stress that national roaming is an appropriate and cost-efficient solution in case of  access network breakdown. However, additional measures need to be taken to mitigate issues  related to core network breakdowns or other outages not covered by national roaming.  Recommendation 2:  Promote National Roaming awareness  Each Member State should work with interested parties such as mobile operators on National  roaming solutions awareness in case of outages. It is important that the outcomes of this study are  shared among the operators and NRAs of each Member States and appropriate knowledge to face  this kind of events is developed. It is of utmost importance that all stakeholders work together to  develop countermeasures and mitigation activities to minimize impact of large scale or prolonged  outages and to assess the impact on critical infrastructures.  Recommendation 3:  Favour mutual aid agreements  One of the most important instruments for operators in facing large scale outages is the definition of  mutual aid agreements. Each competent authority should favour this kind of agreement between  parties as advanced means of emergency preparedness as this solution allows overcoming legal and  competitive barriers and proving to be effective in these scenarios.  Recommendation 4:  Identify clear thresholds in case of activation  In case one of the above solutions is selected, ENISA invites the competent authority to define clear  thresholds both in users affected and time limit in order to facilitate the emergency response. It is  important that these thresholds take into account incident trends and single business continuity  plans. Moreover they should also cover emergency engagement procedures and the coordination  between operators.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  33  Recommendation 5:  Prioritize voice and SMS  Another important recommendation includes services prioritization. In case of activation of national  roaming as a resilience solution not all the traffic should be transferred at one time on the other  operator in order to avoid congestion. Moreover for the same reason only voice and best effort SMS  should be roamed on the second network, leaving data connectivity out of the solution, in order to  use cell phones only for emergency communication and avoid overload of the visited network. This  is due to the large volume of traffic of mobile connectivity where roaming of data will most likely  quickly overload the visited network. For these reasons data connectivity should be backed up by  other means such free public Wi-Fi that can be made available in the affected area.  Recommendation 6:  Favour open Wi-Fi as alternative solution for data  connectivity  Following the previous recommendation, data connectivity should be transferred to available  wireless networks. In case of a mobile operator outage, in order to allow data connectivity from  mobile devices, free public Wi-Fi hot spots should be considered an option. Visited providers should  be allowed to open their proprietary spots in order to alleviate the traffic and allow IP based  communications. Moreover also other providers and private citizens should be allowed to open their  connectivity in case of outages due to natural disasters as it happened during the 2012 Emilia  earthquake47 emergency, relieving in this way the visited network from a possible congestion and  allow its use only for emergency communications.  Recommendation 7:  Establish a M2M inventory  M2M communications relying on 2G/2.5G/3G/3.5G/4G are used in public transport automotive,  tracking & tracing, remote maintenance & control, metering, POS/payment, consumer electronics,  healthcare and security sectors. Outages on a mobile provider could affect these sectors and could  have cascading consequences on other critical services and therefore everyday life of large part of  the population. Considering the current trend and growth of these technologies it is auspicated that  every Member State start to develop with providers an inventory of all these SIMs per service and  provider in order to assess the possible impact and define a comprehensive continuity plan in case of  outage. This should enable to face a scenario where, for example, the public transport of a major  metropolitan area relies on 2G SIMs of a particular provider. When this provider is affected by a  major outage disturbing the mobility of millions of people, there should be a timely assessment of  the impact and the activation of back up activities.  Recommendation 8:  Be prepared for an eventual mobile network outage  The continuous reliance on mobile communication and its expected growth paired with the  current trend on incidents requires Member States to be prepared for eventual network  outages of mobile providers. Enterprise business continuity plans prove to be efficient but they  do not eliminate completely the risk and cascading effects. Member States should consider   a comprehensive national risk assessment framework that takes into account not only  single provider’s business continuity plans but  47  Sharing vs. the earthquake in northern Italy: a cause for hope (2012) http://edgeryders.eu/protecting-and-enhancing-  commons/mission_case/sharing-vs-earthquake-northern-italy-cause-hope  http://edgeryders.eu/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/sharing-vs-earthquake-northern-italy-cause-hope#sthash.mqsOa2fy.dpuf http://edgeryders.eu/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/sharing-vs-earthquake-northern-italy-cause-hope#sthash.mqsOa2fy.dpuf  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  34   envisions also waterfall effects on the population and critical services as government  and public transport for example.  Scenarios like the one in which the affected national mobile provider has a large penetration  that includes also   SIMs used in public utilities and transport   dykes/dams   power grids   MTM controls  should be envisioned and ad hoc back up plan defined.  Recommendation 9:  Identify key people within Critical Infrastructure  services  Key people and key services should be identified and emergency preparedness plan should be  defined accordingly. In facing an emergency, one of the critical steps is to identify the critical  services and key people. Member States should build awareness and invite public and private sector  to assess their reliance on the mobile network. Moreover they should invite all the possible  stakeholders to identify key people within the most critical services and include them into the  national risk assessment framework in order to activate back up procedures. Eventually this would  require a civil contingency agency or competent organization to keep an updated list of these  services and people to be used during emergency.

In less than 30 years they have  surpassed the traditional fixed line telephony. Every day millions of European citizens rely on mobile  telephony for work, social life, but also to contact emergency services. Hence outages of a mobile  network can have a severe impact on the economy and on society.  Mobile network outages are common. In 2012, EU Member States reported 79 significant incidents  of electronic communications to ENISA and the European Commission. Most of these incidents had  an impact on mobile telephony and mobile Internet.  The goal of this report is to help National Regulatory Authority (NRAs) understand if and how  roaming at national level could be used to improve resilience of mobile communication networks  and services in case of large outages and start the discussion with the market players around this  topic.  In some countries, national roaming is imposed by the NRAs with the objective to promote and  stimulate competition by facilitating the entrance of new actors in the market. Sometimes national  roaming is implemented on a voluntary basis between operators without intervention or request  from the NRA for commercial purposes but as it will become clear in this report it can also be used to  mitigate outages.  ENISA is aware that each Member State has a different regulatory approach and  telecommunications market. For these reasons this report, after investigating the technical and  organizational aspects, presents a portfolio of solutions that can be applied based on the different  markets and regulations:   No roaming   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection   Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection   Roaming permanently activated by the customer  Member States are invited to use this as a starting point for the discussion of national roaming as a  resilience solution with the mobile telecom operators in order to develop schemes to mitigate large  outages following the resulting recommendations:  Discuss portfolio of solutions offered - In this way they can use these options as a base to tailor their  own solution taking into consideration their own legal constrains and needs and agreements among  operators.  Promote National Roaming awareness – Each Member State should work with interested parties  such as mobile operators on National roaming solutions awareness in case of outages.  Identify clear thresholds in case of activation - In case one of the above solutions is selected, ENISA  invites the competent authority to define clear thresholds both in users affected and time limit in  order to facilitate the emergency response.  Prioritize voice and SMS - Another important recommendation includes services prioritization. In  case of activation of national roaming as a resilience solution not all types of traffic should be  transferred at one time on the other operator in order to avoid congestion.  Favour open Wi-Fi as alternative solution for data connectivity – Data connectivity should be  transferred to available wireless networks.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  v  Establish a M2M inventory - Considering the current trend and growth of M2M technologies  regarding smart cities and public utilities, it is auspicated that every Member State starts to develop  with providers an inventory of all these SIMs per service and provider in order to assess the possible  impact and define a comprehensive continuity plan in case of outage.  Be prepared for an eventual mobile network outage - Member States should consider   a comprehensive national risk assessment framework that takes into account not only  single provider’s business continuity plans but   envisions also cascading effects on the population and critical services as government  and public transport for example.  Identify key people within CI services - Key people and key services should be identified and  emergency preparedness plan should be defined accordingly.  Mobile communication networks and services have become an integral part of everyday life. People  are now more and more reliant on their mobile phone and expect to be connected anywhere at any  time. Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda remarked: “Telecom touches  everything and users are developing massive expectations of it. Markets must function, devices must  function, networks must function and investment needs to happen.”  For these reasons ENISA investigated national roaming as a solution for mitigating outages in order  to foster security and resilience of European communications networks and ensure that European  citizens can communicate also in case of major outages.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner_for_Digital_Agenda  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  vi  Table of Contents  Executive summary iv  1 Introduction 1  2 The role of mobile communications in everyday life 4  2.1 Penetration and adoption of mobile communications 4  2.2 Machine to Machine 5  2.3 Mobile network access at the home operator 6  2.4 Roaming 9  3 Existing national roaming schemes 11  3.1 Types of roaming schemes 11  3.2 National roaming in the EU 13  3.3 National roaming outside the EU 18  4 Limitations and challenges 20  4.1 Limitations 20  4.2 Challenges 21  5 Technical solutions for mitigating mobile network outages 24  5.1 No national roaming 24  5.2 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection 25  5.3 Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards 27  5.4 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection 29  5.5 Roaming permanently activated by the customer 30  6 Recommendations 32  Recommendation 1:  Discuss portfolio of solutions offered 32  Recommendation 2:  Promote National Roaming awareness 32  Recommendation 3:  Favour mutual aid agreements 32  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  vii  Recommendation 4:  Identify clear thresholds in case of activation 32  Recommendation 5:  Prioritize voice and SMS 33  Recommendation 6:  Favour open Wi-Fi as alternative solution for data connectivity 33  Recommendation 7:  Establish a M2M inventory 33  Recommendation 8:  Be prepared for an eventual mobile network outage 33  Recommendation 9:  Identify key people within CI services 34  7 References 35  EU Legislation 35  Other papers 35  Internet pages 36  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  1  1 Introduction  Mobile communications are an integral part of everyday life. In less than 30 years they have  surpassed the traditional fixed line telephony. Every day millions of European citizens rely on mobile  telephony for work, social life, but also to contact emergency services. Hence outages of a mobile  network can have a severe impact on the economy and on society.  For example, last year there was a large mobile network outage in the Netherlands. The network of  one provider failed, causing outages in a vital economic area in the Netherlands. Millions of  customers were affected, for several days, and even public transport in a particular metropolitan  area was afflicted. It must be noticed that in this particular incident only the network of one provider  was affected. Subsequently, the Dutch government started a discussion with providers about  possibilities of using roaming to mitigate outages of mobile networks. Recently these discussions  resulted in a national roaming agreement specifically for significant mobile network outages.  Researches are on-going about possible extensions of this agreement.  ENISA has been working for several years with regulators in EU Member States to address security  and resilience of electronic communication networks. In particular, ENISA has been supporting  regulators in the implementation of Article 13a of the 2009 reform of the EU’s legislative framework  for electronic communications1. The goal is providing advice and fostering exchange of best practices  about improving the security and resilience of electronic communication networks in the EU. In this  document the reader will find an overview of different ways national roaming could be used to  address mobile outages.  Article 13a of the EU directive on a common regulatory framework for  electronic communications networks and services  As part of the 2009 reform of the EU’s legislative framework for electronic communications, a new  article in the Framework directive was added: Article 13a asks EU Member States to ensure security  and resilience of electronic communication services and networks. ENISA has been supporting the  EU Member States in implementing Article 13a. For example, ENISA set up an expert group of  experts from NRAs (national regulatory authorities) which meets several times per year to discuss  the implementation of Article 13a, past incidents, common issues and best practices. ENISA also  collects reports about significant incidents from NRAs across the EU and aggregates these reports to  provide a single EU perspective. Based on reports about past incidents and discussions with NRAs,  ENISA chooses topics for further investigation or research. This year, for example, ENISA is  investigating two topics in more detail:   Dependencies of electronic communications on power supply; this will be addressed in a  separate report.   National roaming to mitigate mobile network outages; results of our research are reported  in this document.

In this section we present some of the data NRAs reported to  ENISA and the European Commission (EC) for 2012, in the context of the Article 13a: EU Member  States reported 79 significant incidents of electronic communications to ENISA and the European  Commission. Most of these incidents had an impact on mobile telephony and mobile Internet (see  Figure 4).  Figure 1: Average number of users affected per incident per service (1000s). 2  For incidents in all four services, hardware failure was the most common cause. For mobile  telephony and mobile internet the second most common cause was a software bug.

They can use this report to start the discussion around the topic with industry experts involved in  security, resilience, and/or business continuity, especially belonging to Telecommunications  Provider. This report can be also used by civil protection, crisis management agency and critical  industries to get an idea of how to improve resilience of mobile communications for critical  functions and critical services who rely on mobile networks to function properly.  Goal & Scope  The goal of this report is to help NRAs understand if and how national roaming could be used to  improve resilience of mobile communication networks and services in their country and start the  discussion with the market players around this topic.  In this report are analysed only the core electronic communication services: mobile telephony and  mobile Internet access. Other types of mobile services or value added services are not considered.  It must be underlined that this report considers mobile phones but also mobile devices in general,  including mobile communications between machines (MTM). Moreover it should be also remarked  here that the focus is on national roaming from a resilience perspective, i.e. how national roaming  can be used to mitigate outages. Although they are mentioned at times, other types of motivations  for national roaming (for example, competition, innovation, cost-reduction, et cetera) are not  deepened.  Structure of this document  This document is structured as follows:   general background on electronic mobile communication in Europe and its technical  working;   introduction of national roaming and overview of existing national roaming agreements;   overview of challenges and limitations surrounding national roaming;   portfolio of a number of viable approaches that NRAs could evaluate to mitigate mobile  network outages using national roaming;   summary and recommendations.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  4  2 The role of mobile communications in everyday life  Mobile communication networks and services have become an integral part of everyday life. People  are now more and more reliant on their mobile phone and expect to be connected anywhere at any  time. Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda remarked: “Telecom touches  everything and users are developing massive expectations of it. Markets must function, devices must  function, networks must function and investment needs to happen.”  A good example of the possible impact of a mobile communication network outage is the previously  mentioned outage in the Netherlands 3 . In 2012, the infrastructure of a large electronic  communication operator was disrupted by a fire in a building adjacent to a site of the provider. The  consequences of the fire on the site of the provider affected about 5 million subscribers in the  western part of the country, impacting critical metropolitan areas like Rotterdam (a major port and a  major industrial area) and the Hague (the seat of the Dutch government). The outage affected both  2G and 3G communications, and had an impact on phone calls, messaging, Machine-to-Machine  communications and mobile Internet. It is important to note that due to the outage tram connection  between Utrecht - Nieuwegein were out of order too because of their reliance on M2M 2G for  communication with control centres. This incident highlights the dependency of economy and  society on mobile communication networks and services and how the outage of a mobile provider  could have cascading consequences on other critical services and therefore everyday life of large  part of the population.  2.1 Penetration and adoption of mobile communications  Penetration of mobile electronic communications is high in all EU countries and the number of  mobile SIM cards in use has exceeded 100% of the population in all EU Member States (see Figure  1). Mobile connections are expected to continue growing in the coming years, while at the same  time fixed line connections are expected to decrease in most EU countries (see Figure 2).

According to surveys, mobiles phone users want to check their phones about every 6 minutes and  some check it up to 150 times per day6. With the adoption of smartphones, use of mobile  communications will continue to increase as smartphones offer many new attractive features and  services for users. In 2017, smartphones are expected to account for about 90% of all mobile phones  (see figure 3).  Figure 5: Types of mobile phones in Europe 7  2.2 Machine to Machine  Besides consumer usage, electronic communications are also used in Machine-to-Machine (M2M)  communications, where two systems exchange data without human intervention. Mobile Machine- to-Machine communications can rely on 2G/2.5G/3G/3.5G/4G networks. They are used in public  utilities, automotive, consumer electronics, healthcare, security, smart metering (electricity meters),  RMAC (remote monitoring automation and control) telemetry applications, “track and trace,” with  mobile connectivity not integrated directly into a car, POS/payment and ATMs. Considering that this  technology represents one of the core components of the development of smart city they are one  critical point of failure.  Depending 2G/2.5G/3G/3.5G/4G the outage of a mobile provider could have  cascading consequences on other critical services and therefore everyday life of large part of the  population.  5Based on Ovum (2012), Mobile Regional and Country Forecast: 2012–17, Telco Strategy  6 Spencer B, (2013), Mobile users can't leave their phone alone for six minutes and check it up to 150 times a day, Daily Mail  http://www.dailymail.co.ukhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk viewed on 02/07/13  7 Based on Ovum (2013), Mobile Phone and Smartphone Forecast 2013–2017, Devices and platform  1.106.996  260.004  240.000  250.000  260.000  270.000  280.000  290.000  950.000  1.000.000  1.050.000  1.100.000  1.150.000  2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017  Total mobile connections (000s) Total fixed voice lines (000s)  0  200.000  400.000  600.000  800.000  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017  Active Smartphones Active feature phones  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  6  2.3 Mobile network access at the home operator  Mobile communications permeate our reality and in order to start discussing organizational and  technical challenges there follows an overview of the components in a mobile network. It is shown  how normally a customer connects to his/her operator, and how a telephone call is set up8.  Note that this is an abstract and generalized picture. Network architectures and communication  technology is constantly changing and differs from one provider to the other. We briefly describe the  steps, introducing the main components of the mobile network.  Suppose a subscriber turns on his/her mobile device  and wants to make a telephone call:  1. The mobile device (of the subscriber) finds a  mobile base station (BTS) in reach and  requests the base station to connect. The  device sends the International Mobile  Subscriber Identity (IMSI) of his/her Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) card to the base station.  In addition, the device requests for a location  registration in order to use mobile services.  2. The base station (BTS) forwards the request to  a base station controller (BSC), and finally to  the mobile switching centres (MSC).  3. The MSC authenticates the device with the  IMSI of the SIM, and checks if the user can  connect and what services are available to the  user, by checking if IMSI is in the HLR (Home  Location Register). This is called the IMSI  attach procedure. In a next step the MSC  checks the kind of services available to the  user (the credit, etc.). If all is well, the location  registration request is accepted.  In this example the mobile device was connecting to a base station of its own operator, also  called home-operator.  Dealing with networks of multiple operators in automatic or manual modes  In practice in most EU countries, most areas are covered by the base stations of several operators. It  may even be the case that (temporarily) the mobile device is out of range of the home network, and  only in range of other networks. In this case, the device tries to select a more suitable network and  to request for a location registration on the visited network.  There are two modes for network selection: automatic and manual. In both cases, the device relies  on information directly stored in the SIM card:  8 GSMA (2012),Mobile Infrastructure Sharing  BSC  BTS  BSC  BTS  BTS  BTS  BTS  MSC  AuC  EIR VLR  HLR  Billing  gateway  Interconnection to other operators  Access network  Mobile  device  1  2  3  4  5  Figure 6: Connecting to the (home) network  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  7  - Home network and equivalent list including the home operator code (Mobile Country Code  followed the Mobile Network Code) derived from the IMSI or equivalent home operator  networks’ codes if present, in priority order.  - Operator controlled networks list including the codes for networks preferred by the  operator in priority order.

This list is replaced for each new location registration procedure.  These networks are equivalent to the current network in the networks selection10 .  In automatic mode, the mobile device scans the spectrum and finds all available networks. The  device then chooses a network in priority order based on the following list:  1. Home network or equivalents list in priority order (e.g. operator with a permanent national  roaming agreement with a tier)  2. User controlled networks list in priority order  3. Operator controlled networks list in priority order  4. Other network with received high quality signal in random order  5. Other networks in order of decreasing signal quality  This means that it requests first to the home network or equivalent as described in the first list. If  none of them are found, the device selects a network in the next list, et cetera. Once a network is  selected, the device sends a location registration request in order to register to this network and  access mobile services.  In manual mode, the device researches and displays all available networks including the networks  present in the forbidden networks list (in opposition to the automatic mode). The networks are  presented to the user in the same priority order as do the automatic mode. Then, the user selects  arbitrary a network from the networks list. Once the user has made a manual selection, the mobile  device sends a location registration request to the network in order to access mobile services from  this selected network11.  The base station forwards the request to the MSC. In case of visited network, the MSC would not  find the IMSI of the visited user in its HLR but can identify the code of the home network thanks to  the IMSI so it can contact the HLR of the home operator. In case there is no roaming agreement  between both operators, the home network answers that the device should never be allowed to  connect to the visited network and the BTS of the visited network sends a reject message in  response to the location registration request (see section 2.3.2). Mobile services are denied and the  mobile device does not connect to the base stations of that operator anymore. The situation is  depicted in Figure 7. In case a roaming agreement has been set up, the device follows the process as  described in the section 2.4.  9 3GPP Organisational Partners (2013), 3rd Generation Partnership Project;Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals;  Characteristics of the  Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application  (release 12)  10 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  11 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  8  Reject messages  There are many different types of reject messages sent in reply to a denied location registration  request12, but they can be summarized in two main categories: hard reject and soft reject. In both  cases, when a mobile device is not allowed to have access to a visited network, because roaming  agreements between the visited and the home operators are not activated, the visited operator  would send back an appropriate Reject Cause Value to let the device continue searching for other  networks.  If the network sends a “hard reject” message (Reject Cause Value = network not allowed), then the  device is not allowed to roam in the visited operator network and is informed that the network is  forbidden. The device then automatically adds the network to a list of “forbidden networks for  roaming” stored in the SIM card. This list is kept even when the device is switched off or when the  SIM card is removed. The device will not be able to connect to this network in automatic mode  anymore. Nevertheless, it could access it in manual mode if the location registration request  becomes successful. Indeed, during manual search, the device shows all the available networks to  the user, even the ones already included in the “forbidden Networks list”13. The user can select again  the same foreign network (which previously sent a hard reject message), and then a new location  registration request is sent and can potentially become positive (for example, in case of ad hoc  roaming activation). This of course means that users of an operator experiencing an outage will not  be able to automatically connect to any visited networks even if national roaming is configured and  authorized, unless they initiate a manual network search on the device.  On the other hand, in case of light error message (“soft reject”) (i.e. not forbidden), the device  continues receiving signals from the foreign networks even if it cannot connect to it. The negative  side of this configuration is a certain level of pollution of signals between antennas and mobile  devices. However, it does not impact quality of service for users or mobile devices’ battery longevity.  In this case only, the device can automatically switch networks at any time if the message becomes  positive. This of course means that, if the home operator experiences a network breakdown and the  visited operator authorizes national roaming for these affected subscribers, devices will  automatically switch to and access the visited network.  12 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  13 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  BTS  BTS BTS  Mobile  device  connect connect  reject accept  Figure 7: Coverage by multiple networks  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  9  2.4 Roaming  Roaming is defined as the use of mobile services from another operator, which is not the home  operator. The most well-known form of roaming is international roaming, which allows users to use  their mobile devices when abroad. National roaming is roaming on networks of operators within the  same country.  This happens in case the user cannot reach a base station of its home-operator, but connects to the  base station of another network (roaming), because for example:   the mobile device is being used abroad   in that area the home operator is not covered by base stations.  We call the network that is not a home network and to which the mobile device tries to connect to a  “visited network”.

The mobile device (of the subscriber – in blue) finds a mobile base station (BTS) of another  operator in reach (the pink components) and requests one of these base stations to connect.  The device sends the IMSI of its SIM to the base station to register. On the device, the  selection of an operator’s network could be either in manual or automatic mode. As  described in the section 2.3.1, mobile device selects a network based on different lists  classified in priority order. In addition, the device requests for a location registration in order  to use mobile services.  2. Like before, the base station (BTS) forwards the request to a base station controller (BCS),  and finally to the mobile switching centre (MSC) of the visited network.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  10  3. The steps are different from this point on:  a. The MSC of the visited operator tries to find the IMSI (of the SIM of the mobile device) in  its network’s HLR. The MSC however does not find it as that IMSI was allocated by a  competitor (the home operator).  b. The MSC uses the IMSI to identify the home network of the SIM (the blue components)  thanks to the Mobile Country Code followed by the Mobile Network Code. If a roaming  agreement exists between the providers, the MSC contacts the home network’s HLR,  authenticates the mobile device and retrieves the relevant parts of the profile of the  subscriber. This data (about the visiting subscriber) is stored in the VLR (Visiting Location  Register) of the visited network. The VLR keeps a temporary profile of the subscriber, for  the purpose of roaming. This is done even before the subscriber starts to consume any  services (idle mode)14.  A mobile device registered on a visited network periodically and automatically attempts to connect  to its home operator network or any other high priority networks (as described in the section 2.3.1)  if on automatic mode. A period is  configured in the SIM card to scan the available networks in a  specific location. The default period used is usually 60 minutes but can be configured from 6 minutes  to 8 hours in 6 minute steps in the SIM. If any higher priority networks are found, the mobile device  stays on the visited network15.  Often, the visited operator charges more than what the home network operator would have  charged. These extra costs are called ‘roaming costs’. Consumer organizations, governments in the  EU and the EC have repeatedly taken legislative steps to reduce roaming costs16 (for example, by  posing hard limits to the price of calls, data, and messages across the EU).  To avoid expensive bills due to inconsiderate consumption of mobile services on a foreign network,  users have the possibility to set up a “do not roam” button, especially for mobile data consumption.  With that set up directly configured in the mobile device, the users cannot consume data when they  are roaming on another network.  14 European Parliament (2006), Technical Issues on Roaming: Transparency, Technical Aspects and Data – Overview related to the  proposed regulation on Roaming  15 3GPP Organisational Partners (2009), 3rd Generation Partnership Project : Technical Specification Group Core Network Terminals; Non- Access-Stratum (NAS) functions related to Mobile Station (MS) in idle mode (release 9)  16  European Parliament and Council (2012), Regulation (Eu) No 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012  on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  11  3 Existing national roaming schemes  International roaming is perhaps the most well-known type of roaming, but also national roaming is  quite common. In this section we give a brief overview of existing national roaming schemes. The  overview is the result of the desktop research and interviews with all the different stakeholders.  3.1 Types of roaming schemes  We summarize hereunder the different types of national roaming schemes, used in the EU, and  outside the EU.  MVNO - Mobile Virtual  Network Operator  A MVNO is a virtual operator which does not own a mobile access  network. The MVNO has an agreement with another operator, to allow  its customers to access the mobile network and consume mobile  services17.  New entrants This national roaming scheme aims to facilitate new entrants in the  market – with the goal to improve competition. The new entrant makes  a national roaming agreement to have an immediate full geographic  coverage without high initial investments18. Such agreements are usually  temporary.  A common situation is to allow new 3G licensees to temporary use the  2G network of existing operators during the time it is rolling out its own  infrastructure19.  Note that Article 12 1(g) of the Access Directive (2002/19/EC) provides a  legal framework for imposing national roaming obligations to operators  with a significant market power in order to improve and stimulate  competition in the market.  France represents an example of this scheme.  Coverage of rural areas In this scheme a provider extends its coverage to scarcely populated  (rural) areas using a national roaming agreement. This national roaming  scheme aims to facilitate smaller operators who may not be able to  sustain the costs of covering a large territory with a low density of  population20.  Note that Article 4 of the directive No 128/1999/EC provides a legal  framework for this: “Member States may, where necessary, take action,  in accordance with Community law, to ensure the coverage of less- populated areas”21.  17 Sutherland E.

Regional licenses In countries with regional licenses, national roaming can be used by  operators to offer services in other regions. This allows smaller operators  to provide a national service, without actually covering the entire  country22. This situation is seen, for instance, in large countries like India  where the market is divided in regions/states.  In flight/at sea mobile  services  Some operators provide roaming services to allow customers to use  mobile services in flight or at sea, 23  for instance using roaming  agreements with satellite communications providers.  Emergency roaming The roaming agreement can be used for resilience purpose, supporting  the traffic of customers affected by an outage. Different schemes can be  implemented and are described in more detailed in the section 5.  Sweden, USA and Caribbean are good examples of different schemes of  national roaming for resilience purpose.  22 Sutherland E. (2011), The regulation of national roaming, International Telecommunications Society, 18-21 September 2011, Budapest,  p.2  23 Sutherland E. (2011), The regulation of national roaming, International Telecommunications Society, 18-21 September 2011, Budapest,  p.24  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  13  3.2 National roaming in the EU  In some countries, national roaming is imposed by the NRAs with the objective to promote and  stimulate competition by facilitating the entrance of new actors in the market. Sometimes national  roaming is implemented on a voluntary basis between providers (as part of business agreements),  without intervention or request from the NRA. We summarized the findings of the research in Figure  9 where the different implementations of national roaming are represented. Note that we did not  find information or receive feedback about all EU countries, so this overview may be incomplete and  it represents only if national roaming is obliged by the NRA or allowed for commercial purposes.  NR required by NRA  NR allowed but not required  Figure 9: Existing national roaming implementations in the EU  Austria  In Austria, operators owning a 2G network are obliged to provide national roaming to operators  which enter the market with a 3G license without the need for deploying also a 2G infrastructure.  This type of national roaming can be used for a maximum duration of four years, and the 3G  licensees have to cover at least 20% of the population. The roaming obligation only covers roaming  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  14  on 2G network to 3G operators (i.e. not 3G-to-3G for example)24. The goal of this scheme is to  facilitate the entrance of 3G operators.  Czech republic  In the Czech Republic, the Electronic Communications Act does not require national roaming. Also  the national regulatory authority does not require national roaming to mobile operators although it  is possible to provide it on a commercial basis (common agreement). A change should occur in 2014,  after the completion of the auction for mobile frequencies.  Croatia  According to the Croatian Electronic Communication Act, all operators must provide access to their  networks. In 2005, Tele2 (3rd operator) signed a roaming agreement with Vipnet to ensure that,  upon its launch, its customers would have access to a network with national coverage which was in  force until 2008 when Tele2 signed a contract with HT. All terms are commercially agreed (in both  cases).  Denmark  According to the Danish law, all operators must provide access to their networks. With such scheme,  the Danish NRA aims at promoting the access of new entrants and particularly MVNO in order to  24 Ovum (2012), Country Regulation Overview – Austria  25 GSMA Intelligence(2013), Data Dashboard  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ viewed on 01/07/2013  26 GSMA Intelligence(2013), Data Dashboard  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ viewed on 01/07/2013  Austria (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  8,4M  13,4M 159% 3  Czech Republic (Q4 2012)25  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  10,5M  13,8M  138%  3  Croatia (Q4 2012)26  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  4,8M  6M 116% 3  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ https://gsmaintelligence.com/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  15  stimulate market competition27. In 2003, 3 Denmark signed a roaming agreement with TDC to  ensure that, upon its launch, its customers would have access to a network with national coverage.  Finland  In Finland, similarly, the Telecommunications Market Act was amended in 2001 to oblige 2G  licensees with significant market share to provide national roaming to 3G operators, covering a  minimum of 20% of the population. Furthermore, in 2006, the act was again amended to be more  general and applicable to all mobile network technologies to oblige all mobile operators with  significant market power to agree on national roaming with other operators upon request28.  France  In France, a recent entrant (i.e. Free/Iliad) made a national roaming agreement with the incumbent  operator Orange France in 2012 while building out its own infrastructure. In France, 2G national  roaming is enforced by the regulator, but the 3G agreement is based on commercial arrangement  between operators. To benefit from the 2G national roaming, Free had to cover a least 25% of the  population with 3G technology. This temporary agreement should be terminated by 201629.  Italy  In Italy national roaming is enforced by the NRA. New entrants have the opportunity to request  national roaming agreements from existing operators for a period up to 18 months.

Ireland  In Ireland, like in Austria, national roaming is mandatory for operators of 2G networks, and must be  offered to 3G operators covering 20% of the population. This agreement is in principle based on  commercial negotiations. In case of non-agreement, the regulator may set the prices based on the  retail price minus any avoidable costs32. In Ireland, two new entrants, Meteor and 3, successfully  concluded national agreements with established operators in 200533.  Poland  In Poland, operators are not obliged to offer national roaming, but it is allowed by the NRA. Indeed,  new entrants have had the opportunity to conclude national roaming agreements with existing  operators34. For example, Polish telecom P4 made a national roaming agreement with Polska  Telefonia Cyfrowa in 2012 to reduce gaps network coverage. This operator already concluded similar  deals with other operators in the past for the same purpose35.  30 Ovum (2013), Country Regulation Overview - Italy  31 GSMA Intelligence(2013), Data Dashboard  https://gsmaintelligence.com/ viewed on 01/07/2013  32 Ovum (2012), Country Regulation Overview - Ireland  33 Sutherland E.

The scheme is based on voluntary agreements between the operators (i.e.  Telenor, Tele2, TeliaSonera and Tree), and regards a limited number of SIM cards (4,000) to roam  nationally. A detailed overview on the solution is provided in chapter 5.3.  Spain  In Spain several operators have entered into national roaming agreements over the past years. In  2008 Yoigo concluded a five-year agreement with Telefonica Espana as well as with Orange Spain, in  order to extend its 2G and 3G coverage to areas not yet covered by its own network36.  The Netherlands  Following the outage of Vodafone in 2012, the Netherlands searched for a resilience solution in case  of an operator outage. As a result, the three operators (Vodafone, KPN and T-Mobile) have  concluded regional roaming agreements that would allow each two providers to temporary serve  the third provider’s customers in case of an outage. The coverage will not be necessarily national as  the agreement could enter into force for a specific region of the country only.  A detailed overview  of the solution is provided in chapter 5.2.  36 Ovum (2012), Mobile Network Sharing Deals Analyzer: 2H11–1H12, Telco Strategy  Sweden (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  9,5M  14,8M 156% 6  Spain (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  46,9M  53,2M 113% 4  Netherlands (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  16.7M  19.9M 119%  4  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  18  3.3 National roaming outside the EU  Australia  National roaming is allowed in Australia to extend the coverage of an operator in the countryside.  Vodafone Australia provides this service to its customers on demand37. The principle is that if  Vodafone’s customers want to use their mobile communications services in the rural areas of  Victoria and Tasmania, outside the coverage of their home operator, they have the possibility to  contact the customer centre to activate the national roaming service. In this case, customers roam  on the network of Telstra as soon as the network of Vodafone is not available in the specified areas.  The switch of networks is automatic unless the customer is already on a call. In this last scenario, the  call drops and the user has to redial the number from the Telstra’s network.  India  The Indian telecommunications sector is split according to the 22 circles of India and most of the  Indian operators have only local or regional licenses to operate mobile services. In this context,  roaming represents a way to provide mobile services at national level (i.e. in all circles). This kind of  roaming is called inter-circle roaming and is currently in the process of being regulated on prices by  the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)38. Each circle acts as a separate country/region  which makes the comparison with national roaming. Nevertheless, there are some cases of intra- circle roaming which can be associated to national roaming: a customer of an operator can use the  network of a competitor operating in the same circle. This type of intra-circle roaming has primarily  been implemented to improve operator's coverage inside circles where they do not have strong  network.  USA  In 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted an order to ensure that customers  have access to mobile Internet anywhere the service is technically available39.  37 Vodafone Australia, National roaming, http://www.vodafone.com.au/personal/services/coverage/nationalroaming viewed on  08/08/2013  38 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (2013), Consultation Paper on review of Tariff for National Roaming, New Delhi  39 Goldman D.

This completes the existing framework on national  roaming for voice services. Indeed, the national authority already requested operators to conclude  voice national roaming agreements for the first time in 1981. In 2007, the FCC strengthened its  position arguing that mobile providers need to provide voice roaming automatically.  In addition, USA has experienced some sorts of emergency national roaming. Such agreement was  introduced ad hoc in 2012 between AT&T and T-Mobile for areas heavily impacted by Hurricane  Sandy in New York and New Jersey. Customers were authorized to make calls in those areas on the  network which was the most operational, whichever the network was a home or a visited network.  This means that the switch of network was automatic, based on the best signals. This service was not  differently charged to the customers but followed the existing rate plans40.  Caribbean  In addition to USA, Caribbean has implemented emergency roaming agreements ad-hoc. Beginning  of 2013, CCT experienced an important outage, requesting the support of its competitors Digicel.  During more than 7 days, Digicel hosted both prepaid and post-paid customers of CCT without any  changes of tariff plans for them. They were able to make national and international calls while also  using their data services. CCT customers were requested to select the Digicel network thanks to the  manual mode of their device41.  40 Berry Review (2012), AT&T & T-Mobile Enter Into Emergency Roaming Agreement for Hurricane Sandy,  http://www.berryreview.com/2012/10/31/att-t-mobile-enter-into-emergency-roaming-agreement-for-hurricane-sandy/ viewed on the  09/08/2013  41  BVI Platinum (2013), CCT Network Woes Continue; Digicel/CCT Reach New Roaming Agreement,  http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=Article&articleID=1357663206 viewed on 08/08/2013  USA (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  317.1M  347.2M 109%  12  Virgin Island (Q4 2012)  Population Mobile connections SIMs penetration rate Number of Operators  23,816  28,696 120%  3  http://www.berryreview.com/2012/10/31/att-t-mobile-enter-into-emergency-roaming-agreement-for-hurricane-sandy/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  20  4 Limitations and challenges  We interviewed a number of experts from regulators and the telecommunications industry players,  asking them about their views on and experiences with national roaming. Some of the regulators we  interviewed had already some experience with national roaming in the past (e.g. Austria, Finland,  and Italy). Others currently have national roaming schemes in place (e.g. France, Sweden), or have  researched it in the past. We show which regulators were interviewed in the map below (cf. figure  10). In addition, we interviewed four mobile network providers who have been involved in national  roaming in France, in the Netherlands and in India (where national roaming is a regional matter). In  total hence we interviewed experts from 22 different organizations.  Figure 10: Interviews of regulators  In this section we summarize the issues that were raised and discussed in these interviews.  4.1 Limitations  In the course of this study a number of experts pointed us to the limitations of national roaming for  resilience purpose. It is clear that a number of outages cannot be addressed with national roaming.  In this section we try to underline all the major limitations that can be seen as a starting point for  future areas of research.  Outages affecting all providers in the country  Outages affecting all providers at once cannot be mitigated using roaming. For example, power cuts  usually affect all the providers in a geographic area at the same time. Similarly, natural disasters  might affect several providers at once.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  21  Outages affecting the home HLR  To set up a roaming call the VLR of the visited network and the HLR of the home network must  communicate with each other (via the MSCs) to authenticate the SIM of the mobile device (see  Section 2.4). National roaming cannot be used if the HLR of the home network is unreachable by the  visited operator. This means for example that failures of the HLR (a common cause of outages)  cannot be mitigated by roaming.  Similarly, the IN (Intelligent Network) of the home operator is needed to allow prepaid subscribers  to make calls. In case of IN or MSC breakdown, the visiting network is not able to check the profile  and balance of the visiting subscribers.  In 2012, Orange France and O2 UK mobile networks were separately affected by a core network  breakdown impacting millions of customers. In both cases, the HLR generated multiple error  messages creating an oversaturation of signals and leading the core network to crash. A similar case  appeared in the USA as well in 2011, impacting Verizon42.  Outages affecting shared infrastructure  There are settings where the access network is shared by several operators. For example, in certain  remote areas this may be used to share and reduce high costs of covering areas with low density of  subscribers. In these settings, an outage in the access network would affect several providers at  once. National roaming would not work to mitigate such an outage.  Overloads  National roaming can be a solution if other network providers are up and running and able to deal  with the traffic of the roaming devices. This means, as mentioned in the introduction, that in crises  situations where there is a high traffic overload on all providers, roaming is not a solution. A recent  example is when in 2013, operators in the centre of Boston experienced a big congestion of network  during the annual marathon due to high calls volume following the panic caused by the bombs  explosion43. The unavailability of mobile networks caused more panic, which made the work of  emergency services more difficult. National roaming, however, would not be a solution for this kind  of outage.  4.2 Challenges  During the interviews experts raised a number of challenges that should be addressed.  Overload of the visited network  If during an outage mobile devices are allowed to roam on other networks, this could cause an  overload or a reduced quality of service for the original subscribers of the visited network. As a way  to address this, providers offering roaming could configure restrictions and prioritize their own  customers, in order to keep an acceptable level of quality for their subscribers.  Competition  National roaming could negatively impact competition, and remove incentives for providers to offer  resilient and redundant networks. By allowing national roaming, one might create a “race to the  bottom”, where no provider has an incentive to provide resilient networks anymore – because it is  42  Fitchard, K. (JUL. 13, 2012), Why are mobile networks dropping like flies? Gigaom viewed on 01/07/2013  Why are mobile networks dropping like flies? Gigaom  http://gigaom.com/author/kfitchard/  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  22  easy to back up on the networks of others during an outage. Interestingly, national roaming is often  used in the EU to actually improve competition (new entrant’s scheme e.g.).  One way to address these concerns would be to restrict national roaming to specific circumstances,  in order to deal with severe outages. Another way would be to ensure that the operator suffering  the outage actually bares additional costs for using the other networks (say intra-provider roaming  costs), so as to create an incentive for the operator to prevent outages in the future.  Set up costs  The implementation of national roaming could require (too) large investments by the providers. As a  way to address this, operators could leverage on existing international roaming infrastructure. In  other words, by technically mimicking international roaming as much as possible, the technical  investments needed should be limited.  Roaming costs  It is common practice for providers to charge roaming subscribers higher fees for international  roaming44. Also in national roaming, visited providers could be charging higher fees for the roaming  service. To transfer these costs to the subscriber would seem more complicated, however, in the  case of national roaming. Subscriber must be made aware there is an outage and asked to opt-in to  higher costs. This does not seem very feasible to organize for large numbers of users. At the same  time it would probably anger most consumers if the on top of the outage they are offered the same  services they paid but now for a higher price.  Triggering roaming  National roaming is considered a kind of last-resort solutions. The Dutch regulator, for example, has  agreed with operators to enable national roaming when it is expected that an outage will affect  500,000 customers affected and the network recovery time is expected to be longer than three days.  This however raises another issue. How can operators know if an outage will last a long time?  Providers might underestimate the time needed for recovery. During the outage in the Netherlands,  for example, the provider repeatedly said it expected to restore service in a matter of hours. But in  the end the incident lasted more than several days. One solution could be to use a more objective  parameter for triggering roaming: for example, the duration (until now). For example, the trigger  could be, if an incident lasts more than 12 hours, then national roaming should be enabled.  Voluntary or regulated  It is not clear whether the NRA has a legal mandate to oblige providers to engage in national  roaming agreements for the purpose of resilience. According to article 13a, EU Member States shall  ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks take all appropriate steps to  guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services  provided over those networks45.  One could argue that national roaming is a step to guarantee resilience. One could also argue that  the NRA should just set high-level resilience requirements, and that it is up to the provider to  44 This practice is often severely criticized by EU governments and the EC and stands to finish soon.  45 European Parliament and Council (2009), DIRECTIVE 2009/140/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25  November 2009 amending Directives 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and  services, 2002/19/EC on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, and 2002/20/EC  on the authorization of electronic communications networks and services  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  23  determine what are appropriate steps, and whether or not national roaming agreements could be  helpful in case of large outages.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  24  5 Technical solutions for mitigating mobile network outages  In this section we provide 5 different options for NRAs, based on the input we received from experts  from industry and regulators. For each option we list the pros and cons, and we discuss the main  challenges.  No national  roaming  Ad-hoc activation of  roaming with manual  selection  Automatic  roaming for a  fixed set of SIM  cards  Ad-hoc  activation of  roaming with  automatic  selection  Roaming  permanently  activated by  the customer  Type of  outages  Access network - Not covered + Entire users base could  be covered  - No M2M  communications  + Only vital  public functions  could be covered  - No M2M  communications  + Entire user  base  + M2M  communications  + Entire user  base could be  covered  - Competition  Core network - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered  All operators  affected or  shared  infrastructure  - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered  Overloads - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered - Not covered  No solution for  mitigate outages  Ad-hoc activation  of NR with manual  selection  Automatic roaming  with fixed set of SIMs  Figure 11: Current situation in Europe  5.1 No national roaming  In this approach, national roaming is not set up as a solution to counterbalance the effects of an  outage. The NRA only raises awareness with subscribers (particularly subscribers in critical sectors)  about the importance of backup and failover solutions; ways to mitigate outages of their own  provider, including:  Figure 11: Current situation in Europe of implementation of  National Roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  25   Dual or backup SIMs: subscribing to mobile communications services with more than  one provider allows the customer to spread the risk across two or more providers.   Foreign SIMs: foreign providers have roaming agreement with more than one  operator in almost every country. In that sense, an international card allows the user  to use more than one network.   Other mobile communication services as Wi-Fi, satellite, radio, et cetera.  Technical set up and cost structure  This approach does not require any specific technical set up. In addition, the cost is totally supported  by the customers who ensure themself in case of outage. This approach is individual and depends on  each customer.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage of this approach is that it does not require any investments or legal agreements.  The approach is individual and depends on each customer which agrees to support their own  additional costs to insure him against the negative impact of an outage.  The main disadvantage is that the above-mentioned options are usually cumbersome for consumers:   With dual SIMs users should keep track of two telephone numbers for the important  contacts.   SIM from a foreign country would be too costly to use continuously. In addition,  foreign SIM card could be able to roam on specific providers’ networks with which  the home operator has concluded an international roaming agreement. There is no  way to prevent these specific operators to be affected. Lastly, some countries  impose customers to have a billing address in the country before subscribing to  mobile services so it would be difficult to acquire such a SIM card.   Other identified communications services do not represent a complete alternative:  Satellite telephony is too expensive to use continuously while Wi-Fi allows only a  sedentary use of the services. Wi-Fi could be associated to fixed communications  services more than a substitute to mobile services.  5.2 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection  As for the above mentioned solution, it is possible to activate national roaming, ad-hoc, leaving at  the customer level the decision to use or not this service thanks to the manual network selection.  The Netherlands is a similar example of this solution.  Technical set up  This ad hoc activation of national roaming can be configured according to two different models  already presented in the previous scheme. The only difference in this case is that the customer  manually selects the network to roam to. In that sense, the user is aware of the roaming service.  However, we cannot consider the manual registration alone as consent from the customer to pay  additional fees, if any. It is necessary to notify the users about the additional fees of national  roaming with clear messages (e.g. sms as for international roaming).  To allow only a manual selection of the network it is important to set up hard reject message with  network forbidden. In this case only the network is stored in the forbidden list included in the SIM  card and can only be selected manually by the user.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  26  In both cases described above, national roaming can be authorized by the visited operator at  national level or according to Location Area Code (i.e. LAC) in order to target the zones affected.  Cost structure  Costs could be billed in the commercial agreement between the providers who enable this  capability: pre-agree lump sum or on a reciprocal basis as described in the previous schemes.  Roaming costs, as a VAS, could be supported by the subscribers who manually select the roaming  network. They acknowledge the national roaming capability and related costs. However, as  described in the technical set up, the manual selection of a hosting network does not represent a  valid consent of the customer to support extra costs. In this sense, clear message are necessary to  raise the awareness about the additional costs.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage is the range of customers who can enjoy the continuous service. Every  customer can manually switch between networks in case the home operator’s network is not  available during an outage. The costs of this solution could be directly charged to the customers as  they manually activate the service and received a clear message informing them about the extra  costs they are subject to in case of national roaming. In that sense, they are aware that national  roaming is a VAS. This creates important incentives for the providers to deploy this solution.  The main disadvantage and challenge is the possible breaches in the market competition. It could  potentially decrease the willingness of operators to deploy a resilient network. Indeed, it is easier to  carry on the networks of competitors during an outage, especially if the costs are supported by the  customers. As a consequence, it is important to set up different thresholds in terms of number of  subscribers impacted, location areas impacted, expected duration of the outage, etc. according to  which the solution will be activate to allow the providers to use this service only in case of serious  incidents.  In addition, an important popularity of this scheme could cause an overload and threaten the service  quality for original subscribers of the visited network. However, the configuration per LAC, ranges of  classes of IMSIs allows a smaller negative impact on service quality for the visited operator’s  customers. The visited network has only to support the users communicating in the areas affected  by the network breakdown.  Lastly, this solution does not represent the most appropriate solution for Machine-to-Machine  communication. Indeed, with a manual solution, the SIM cards in the machine will not be able to  switch networks without a human intervention, which is not possible in most cases.  All things concerned, this solution can benefit to the entire society which has the choice to opt-in or  not. A threshold is necessary to avoid any abuses.  Netherlands - an example of implementation  Following the outage of Vodafone in 2012, the Netherlands searched for a resilience solution in case  of an operator outage. As a result, the three operators (Vodafone, KPN and T-Mobile) have concluded  regional roaming agreements that would allow each two providers to temporary serve the third  provider’s customers in case of an outage. The coverage will not be necessarily national as the  agreement could enter into force for a specific region of the country only.  General set up:  In case of important outage, affecting more people than the predefined thresholds (500,000  customers affected and the network recovery time is expected to be longer than three days), national  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  27  roaming agreements are used to provide primary post-paid services (Voice and SMS) to customers.  According to the exceeding of the thresholds and in concert with the partner operator this solution  can be activated without the involvement of the NRA in the process  Other services (machine to machine, data) are not included due to the possible waterfall effect and  the viable alternatives. For example hosting of rescued customers could impact the network of the  hosted operator. A national survey is currently being conducted regarding critical infrastructures  communications to identify interdependencies, assess impacts and find (technical) solutions.  For  data, Wi-Fi is currently considered as an alternative. This is due to the large volume of traffic of  mobile connectivity where roaming of data will most likely quickly overload the visited network. For  this reason data connectivity should be backed up by other means such free public Wi-Fi and fixed  broadband connections that can be made available in the affected area.  Two operators take over the traffic of the third operator experiencing an outage. The quality of  service for other users (from the helping operators) is closely monitored. Operators have their own  SLAs with their customers, based on KPIs. To be able to take over more traffic from the guest  operator, these key performance indicators can be lowered by the helping operators. Operators have  defined together a minimal level as a maximum to lower their KPIs during RR. However, in case a  critical level is reached in the network, each operator has the right to stop hosting foreign customers.  Technical set up:  National roaming is forbidden in the Netherlands. As a consequence, the international roaming  infrastructure cannot be used and a dedicated infrastructure is set up to support this scheme.  Furthermore, this solution is only possible in case of access network breakdown and not in case of  core network breakdown.  In order to use this service the customers need to manually select the new network on their device.  Since the migration of users is done in different batches of IMSIs, they may have to try several times  until they successfully connect to a foreign network, depending on whether they are part of the  already migrated batch of IMSIs or not. Once they return on an area covered by their home network,  users are switched automatically to their home network.  All the operators’ websites, customer support as well as employees are responsible for raising  customers’ awareness on what actions need to be taken in case of outage.  Costs:  Costs for traffic handling during the activation period will be charged based on the European  roaming tariffs. In case the regular KPIs of the host operator will be lowered to enable handling more  traffic of the guest operator, the host operator runs the risk of breaking SLA agreements with its own  customers. Negotiations for reimbursements of related penalties or claims are underway between  the wholesale departments of the operators. Those negotiations are done separately between each  two operators under confidentiality (Chinese wall) to ensure that competition will not be breached.  5.3 Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards  In this third approach national roaming works only for a specific set of SIMs (or a specific number  range) controlled both in terms of users and usage by the NRA. These specific SIM cards are  distributed by the NRA at the beginning of the outage to targeted users identified with a national  risk assessment and need to be retrieved or deactivated as soon as the network affected by the  outage is recovered. This strong control by the NRA avoids abuses and uses outside the scope of  resilience. The regulator is responsible for distributing the SIM and decides if it should be activate  depending on the expected impact of the outage.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  28  This scheme could be promoted by the NRA but voluntary agreed by providers, or totally obliged by  the NRA. The costs for the extra service (the possibility to roam) are paid by the NRAs or the  operators depending on the agreement.  Technical set up  The scheme requires specific SIM cards capable to have more than one home operator. In that  sense, they should be set up and registered in the HLR of every provider included in the roaming  agreement. This technical specificity ensures the efficiency of the roaming scheme during extended  types of outage, including HLR breakdown. Operators’ networks are flagged as equivalent home  operators’ network in the SIM card which allows the selection of any of those in manual or  automatic mode. As they all have the same priority, the stronger signal determines the network to  select.  No reject messages are needed in this case.  Cost structure  Even if the scheme leverages on the existing infrastructure, it requires the development and the  implementation of specific SIM cards capable to have more than one home operator. In addition, it  requires some organizational costs regarding the definition of the commercial agreement between  operators and the administration of the designated SIMs. Indeed, SIMs cards need to be distributed  by emergency centres during the outage which creates distribution and storage costs. These costs  can be supported by the regulator or by the operators depending on the agreement.  Costs of usage need to be supported by the operator affected by the outage in order to keep their  willingness to have a resilient infrastructure.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage of this scheme is the very limited impact on competition. As this service is  highly controlled by the NRA, the risks of abuses or uses of services outside the scope of resilience  are very low. In addition, as the cost of use is supported by the providers affecting by the outage, it  does not decrease their willingness to invest in a resilient network.  In addition, national roaming for a fixed range of SIMs decreases significantly the risks of network  congestion for the hosting operator. Depending on the number of emergency SIMs, it does not  require any increase of capacity and does not strengthen the quality of service for other customers.  The main disadvantage of the scheme is the limited benefit for customers. Only a limited number of  specific customers (mainly vital public functions) are insured against the impact of an outage and can  use a continuous mobile service. These customers are chosen by the NRAS which controls the  distribution of SIM cards.  In addition, the organizational burdens are quite important: emergency centres need to be  implemented to control and distributed the SIMs in case of outage. It represents the main challenge  of this solution: being able to distribute the SIMs card timely and efficiency to guarantee a limited  breach of mobile communications services.  All in all, it represents a pure solution of resilience, targeted only public vital functions.  Sweden - an example of implementation  In Sweden, the regulator (PTS) has implemented an emergency roaming scheme since 2008. The  scheme is based on voluntary agreements between the operators (i.e. Telenor, Tele2, TeliaSonera  and Tree), and regards a limited number of SIM cards (4,000) to roam nationally.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  29  These 4,000 SIM cards are called emergency SIM cards and are distributed beforehand to specific  crisis centres for use only in case of serious disruption of electronic services or communication  networks. That disruption could be the breakdown of multiples operators with a long expected time  to restore the infrastructure. The regulator decides whether the emergency roaming cards should be  used or not, following requests from the county administrative board concerned by an outage. If the  regulator agrees then the SIM cards are distributed to those parties. The use of these cards is  restricted to vital public functions chosen by the NRA. This means that SIMs are not always available  to targeted customers but highly controlled by the regulator. Once the networks of affected  operators are restored, SIM cards are returned to the crisis centre. The use is only allowed for a  specific period of time.  The user of these specific emergency SIM cards can automatically connect to any available networks,  depending on the quality of signals.  PTS has financed the implementation of this scheme as well as the acquisition of SIM cards, together  with subscriptions. However, the operators have to support the costs associated with their use. If  such costs should become unreasonably expensive for an individual operator, the regulator shall  compensate the operator46.  5.4 Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection  A fourth technical solution is the ad hoc activation of national roaming, only in specific geographic  areas affected by the outage, relying on the automatic network selection mode on the customers’  phones or classes of IMSIs  The USA is a similar example of this solution.  Technical set up  This ad hoc activation of national roaming can be configured according to two different models:   National roaming is configured but not authorized in neither the home operator’s HLR or on  the visited network’s HLR. When the home operator experiences a network breakdown,  national roaming is authorized in the core networks of both parties.   National roaming is configured and authorized in the home operator’s HLR but not  authorized in the visited network. In case of outage, the visited network authorizes the  national roaming for affected users in order to immediately activate the resilience service.  Of course, in this last case, the visited operator would have to configure specific Reject Cause Value  messages, in order not to allow national roaming in case there is no incident. As the scheme needs  to work on automatic network selection mode, light reject messages would need to be used. Indeed,  with light reject messages, the concerned network does not enter into the forbidden networks list  which allows the user to automatically switch to this network in case the location registration  request becomes positive (only in case of outage).The Reject Cause Value messages are described in  the section 2.3.2.  In both cases described above, national roaming can be authorized by the visited operator at  national level or according to Location Area Code (i.e. LAC) or ranges/classes of IMSIs In this last  46 PTS (2008), Facts about emergency roaming  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  30  scenario, national roaming is only activated for the specific geographic area affected by the outage.  LACs are configured directly in the core network of an operator and can be defined according to  geographic areas, number of users, and group of antennas or specific technical features (e.g. an area  covering a railway line).  Cost structure  Costs are billed as defined in the commercial agreement between the providers who enable this  capability. It can be a pre-agreed lump sum with the amount calculated in advance based on  patterns or on a reciprocal basis where both operators (home and visited) calculate the traffic  generated during the outage and the visited network charges the home operator based on some  pre-agreed price per minute.  As the service is automatic for customers, they are not required to take any action to switch  operators which means that they could not be aware of the change of operators’ network. For that  reason, customers are charged according to their actual tariff plan as they would have made a call on  their home network.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main benefit of this approach is the assistance to the entire society affected by the outage:  every customer affected switches automatically to another network in case of outage of their home  operator. This benefit comes without any extra cost to the customer.  However, as a challenge, the visited network has to support an important additional traffic. This  peak of traffic could potentially affect the quality of service for the hosting customers. At the  extreme, it could potentially create a congestion of network for the hosting operator  Nevertheless as national roaming is configured by LAC it allows a smaller negative impact on service  quality for the entire visited operator’s base of customers. The visited network has only to support  the users communicating in the areas affected by the network breakdown. As a result, it keeps the  negative impact of national roaming concentrated in the area affected by the outage.  Lastly, there is a challenge, especially for NRA, to stimulate the operators to conclude such  agreements. Indeed, even if they can use the existing international roaming infrastructure (with  slightly adapted capacity), the variable costs to support can decrease their incentives to agree on  this scheme.  Nevertheless, the working costs avoid any abuses and keep the incentives of operators to develop a  resilient and redundant network. Indeed, more resilient is the network, less probable operator  would have to appeal to this service.  All in all, this resilient solution is beneficial for the entire society without additional costs for  customers. NRA has an important role to play to promote it and stimulate the operators to engage  with each other to deploy such a scheme despite their possible important costs.  5.5 Roaming permanently activated by the customer  A second extreme approach to implement national roaming is to set it up permanently between two  or more operators. This approach is similar to the international roaming: at any time customers can  access the network of another operator which has signed a national roaming agreement with their  home operator in order to use mobile communication services. However, this service needs to be  activated by the customer and is subject to additional fees.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  31  Australia is the main example of this solution even if the purpose is different in that case (extend  coverage in rural areas).  Technical set up  The device connects in priority to its home operator’s network to avoid unnecessary costs. In case  the network of its home operator is not available, it connects to the second priority network which is  the network of the operator which has concluded a national roaming agreement with the home  operator. The home operator directly sets up the priority networks in the SIM card of its users.  No reject messages are required if the services has been activated by the customer as the roaming is  permanently activated.  This set up works in both automatic and manual mode, depending on the user’s preferences.  Cost structure  Costs are billed as defined in the commercial agreement between the providers who enable this  capability. In a pre-agreed lump sum, the operators calculate in advance an amount of money to be  paid. This amount can be accurately calculated beforehand by well know patterns of traffic for each  region and time. As long as that amount is set, then the disrupted operator pays the visited operator  that amount after the incident has been resolved. Alternatively, the operators could agree to settle  the invoice, based on a reciprocal basis, i.e. they both calculate the traffic generated during the  outage and the visited network charges the home operator based on some pre-agreed price per  minute.  This service, as a VAS, is supported by the subscribers who request it. The billing method is in line  with the international roaming service.  Pros, Cons and issues/challenges  The main advantage is the large ranges of customers who can benefit from this value added service.  Indeed, national roaming is always enabled and the customer who wants to ensure a continuous  service is in charge of the opt-in and supports the additional costs.  The main disadvantage and challenge is the probable breaches in the market competition. In this  scheme the operators are basically federating their networks. This is a highly regulated area by the  EU and should be considered only in very specific scenarios for a limited time. The incentives to  develop a complete and resilient network can be impacted as user can always choose to which  network to roam even besides outages. It also means that operators have less control over the  traffic and users on their networks. As a consequence, it is important to set up disruptive fees to  avoid users to usually roam on competitors’ networks.  In addition, an important popularity of this scheme could cause an overload and threaten the service  quality for original subscribers of the visited network. Nevertheless, operators could configure  restrictions and prioritize their own customers.  All things concerned, this solution can be easily used out of the scope of resilience by the users.  Abuses can easily appear and the threat of competition breaches is important. As a consequence,  this solution is not advised by ENISA.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  32  6 Recommendations  In the following recommendations section, you can find a set of actions that could need to be  taken to ensure an appropriate level of resilience in electronic mobile communications in your  country and be prepared in case of large scale outage.  Recommendation 1:  Discuss portfolio of solutions offered  ENISA is aware that each Member State has a different regulatory approach and telecom  market. For these reasons this report presents a portfolio of solutions that can be applied based  on the different markets and regulations:   No roaming   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with manual selection   Automatic roaming for a fixed set of SIM cards   Ad-hoc activation of roaming with automatic selection   Roaming permanently activated by the customer  Member States are invited to use this as a starting point for the discussion of national roaming  as a resilience solution with the mobile telecom operators. In this way they can use these  options as a basis to tailor their own solution taking into consideration their own legal  constraints and needs and agreements among operators. Competent authorities should discuss  them with the operators so that national, technical and legal constrains are clear and make sure that  operators are aware of the different technical options in case of need.  It is important to stress that national roaming is an appropriate and cost-efficient solution in case of  access network breakdown. However, additional measures need to be taken to mitigate issues  related to core network breakdowns or other outages not covered by national roaming.  Recommendation 2:  Promote National Roaming awareness  Each Member State should work with interested parties such as mobile operators on National  roaming solutions awareness in case of outages. It is important that the outcomes of this study are  shared among the operators and NRAs of each Member States and appropriate knowledge to face  this kind of events is developed. It is of utmost importance that all stakeholders work together to  develop countermeasures and mitigation activities to minimize impact of large scale or prolonged  outages and to assess the impact on critical infrastructures.  Recommendation 3:  Favour mutual aid agreements  One of the most important instruments for operators in facing large scale outages is the definition of  mutual aid agreements. Each competent authority should favour this kind of agreement between  parties as advanced means of emergency preparedness as this solution allows overcoming legal and  competitive barriers and proving to be effective in these scenarios.  Recommendation 4:  Identify clear thresholds in case of activation  In case one of the above solutions is selected, ENISA invites the competent authority to define clear  thresholds both in users affected and time limit in order to facilitate the emergency response. It is  important that these thresholds take into account incident trends and single business continuity  plans. Moreover they should also cover emergency engagement procedures and the coordination  between operators.  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  33  Recommendation 5:  Prioritize voice and SMS  Another important recommendation includes services prioritization. In case of activation of national  roaming as a resilience solution not all the traffic should be transferred at one time on the other  operator in order to avoid congestion. Moreover for the same reason only voice and best effort SMS  should be roamed on the second network, leaving data connectivity out of the solution, in order to  use cell phones only for emergency communication and avoid overload of the visited network. This  is due to the large volume of traffic of mobile connectivity where roaming of data will most likely  quickly overload the visited network. For these reasons data connectivity should be backed up by  other means such free public Wi-Fi that can be made available in the affected area.  Recommendation 6:  Favour open Wi-Fi as alternative solution for data  connectivity  Following the previous recommendation, data connectivity should be transferred to available  wireless networks. In case of a mobile operator outage, in order to allow data connectivity from  mobile devices, free public Wi-Fi hot spots should be considered an option. Visited providers should  be allowed to open their proprietary spots in order to alleviate the traffic and allow IP based  communications. Moreover also other providers and private citizens should be allowed to open their  connectivity in case of outages due to natural disasters as it happened during the 2012 Emilia  earthquake47 emergency, relieving in this way the visited network from a possible congestion and  allow its use only for emergency communications.  Recommendation 7:  Establish a M2M inventory  M2M communications relying on 2G/2.5G/3G/3.5G/4G are used in public transport automotive,  tracking & tracing, remote maintenance & control, metering, POS/payment, consumer electronics,  healthcare and security sectors. Outages on a mobile provider could affect these sectors and could  have cascading consequences on other critical services and therefore everyday life of large part of  the population. Considering the current trend and growth of these technologies it is auspicated that  every Member State start to develop with providers an inventory of all these SIMs per service and  provider in order to assess the possible impact and define a comprehensive continuity plan in case of  outage. This should enable to face a scenario where, for example, the public transport of a major  metropolitan area relies on 2G SIMs of a particular provider. When this provider is affected by a  major outage disturbing the mobility of millions of people, there should be a timely assessment of  the impact and the activation of back up activities.  Recommendation 8:  Be prepared for an eventual mobile network outage  The continuous reliance on mobile communication and its expected growth paired with the  current trend on incidents requires Member States to be prepared for eventual network  outages of mobile providers. Enterprise business continuity plans prove to be efficient but they  do not eliminate completely the risk and cascading effects. Member States should consider   a comprehensive national risk assessment framework that takes into account not only  single provider’s business continuity plans but  47  Sharing vs. the earthquake in northern Italy: a cause for hope (2012) http://edgeryders.eu/protecting-and-enhancing-  commons/mission_case/sharing-vs-earthquake-northern-italy-cause-hope  http://edgeryders.eu/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/sharing-vs-earthquake-northern-italy-cause-hope#sthash.mqsOa2fy.dpuf http://edgeryders.eu/protecting-and-enhancing-commons/mission_case/sharing-vs-earthquake-northern-italy-cause-hope#sthash.mqsOa2fy.dpuf  National Roaming for Resilience  National roaming for mitigating mobile network outages  November 2013  Page  34   envisions also waterfall effects on the population and critical services as government  and public transport for example.  Scenarios like the one in which the affected national mobile provider has a large penetration  that includes also   SIMs used in public utilities and transport   dykes/dams   power grids   MTM controls  should be envisioned and ad hoc back up plan defined.  Recommendation 9:  Identify key people within Critical Infrastructure  services  Key people and key services should be identified and emergency preparedness plan should be  defined accordingly. In facing an emergency, one of the critical steps is to identify the critical  services and key people. Member States should build awareness and invite public and private sector  to assess their reliance on the mobile network. Moreover they should invite all the possible  stakeholders to identify key people within the most critical services and include them into the  national risk assessment framework in order to activate back up procedures. Eventually this would  require a civil contingency agency or competent organization to keep an updated list of these  services and people to be used during emergency.

    "abstract": "Mobile communications are an integral part of everyday life. In less than 30 years they have surpassed the traditional fixed line telephony. Every day millions of European citizens rely on mobile telephony for work, social life, but also to contact emergency services. Hence outages of a mobile network can have a severe impact on the economy and on society. Mobile network outages are common. In 2012, EU Member States reported 79 significant incidents of electronic communications to ENISA and the European Commission. Most of these incidents had an impact on mobile telephony and mobile Internet. The goal of this report is to help National Regulatory Authority (NRAs) understand if and how roaming at national level could be used to improve resilience of mobile communication networks and services in case of large outages and start the discussion with the market players around this topic."

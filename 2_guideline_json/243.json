BIBLIOGRAPHY 87  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  This report analyses information and presents an overview of coordinated vulnerability  disclosure (CVD) policies at the national level within the EU. Aside from offering a  comprehensive overview of the EU CVD state of play, it also provides high-level key findings  and recommendations for future improvements.  As shown by the recent Apache Log4j vulnerability, a single software flaw can put hundreds of  millions of devices around the world at risk, leaving organizations struggling to patch affected  systems before the vulnerability turns into a security incident. This is yet another vulnerability  with global repurcussions that shows the importance of security research, communication  between stakeholders, patching and good security practices.  A national CVD policy is a framework under which security researchers are allowed and  encouraged to research ICT products and services, following a set of rules, and report any  vulnerabilities they find to the national authorities or the product vendor. A national CVD policy  helps to increase the overall level of cybersecurity in a country; it increases transparency, and  this helps to build trust in the ICT services and products used in that country. In addition, it  allows for valuable time and cooperation between stakeholders for patch development, which  can potentially reduce the time for exploitation.  At the national level, the research shows that, while evolving in a fragmented EU environment,  multiple EU Member States are making progress in the development of national CVD policies.  Currently, only Belgium, France, Lithuania and the Netherlands are undertaking CVD policy  work and have implemented policy requirements. Among these four countries, policy initiatives  strongly differ. In parallel, four other Member States are on the point of implementing a policy. In  these cases, the proposal is either being examined at the level of policymakers or is being  tested in pilot projects. Another set of ten EU Member States are considering implementing a  national CVD policy or are on the point of doing so. However, failure to reach a consensus at  the political or legislative levels hampered the process. Finally, another group of Member States  (nine) has not implemented a CVD policy and the process for establishing one has not yet  started.  This EU market heterogeneity could be explained by various challenges faced by national  governments when considering CVD initiatives. These challenges include legal, economical and  political aspects which are further addressed in this report. Additionally, the lack of alignment of  CVD practices, terminology, understanding and assessment of a CVD process is perceived as  an obstacle for the implementation of national CVD policies and cooperation between Member  States.  More specifically, it turned out that the comprehensive CVD process is often, but not always,  supported by national CSIRTs, which many countries see as the natural focal point for these  activities. Good practices related to CVD policies and authorities’ involvement have been shared  by Member States representatives and collected in this report.  CVD policy initiatives carried out in China, Japan and the United States were also reported.  These non-EU players presented various methods of creating and adapting a CVD national  policy, and maintaining and working on vulnerability registries. These notions are further  detailed aside from EU practices and illustrated with inspiring inputs from experts.  Furthermore, there are several challenges that were identified by the Member States and are  presented for discussion, along with relevant recommendations that can help mitigate them and  A national CVD  policy helps to  increase the  overall level of  cybersecurity in  a country it  increases  transparency,  and this helps to  build trust in the  ICT services and  products used in  that country.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  support the implementation of national vulnerability disclosure policies. These challenges were  identified and categorized based on their nature as legal, economic or political, and include  findings such as:  • legal risks faced by researchers;  • limited economic incentives for vulnerability research;  • political challenges related to the role of the government and ‘safe harbour’ for  researchers.  Lastly, following the analysis, several recommendations and concrete suggestions were  presented for the role of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) in supporting  CVD in the EU. Some of the most important recommendations and suggested objectives are  listed below.  Major recommendations  • Take the necessary steps to develop and implement national CVD policies.  • Define the role of ethical hackers in relevant national laws to establish a framework for  ethical security research around vulnerabilities.  • Develop incentives for security researchers to actively participate in CVD research.  Role for ENISA and the European Commission  • Provide clear guidance to Member States on how to establish a CVD policy.  • Promote knowledge building and information exchange on CVD at the EU level.  • Encourage the harmonization of CVD initiatives across countries.  The information regarding the state of play of EU Member States presented herein was  collected between Q2 and Q3 2021. Any updates to that status since then will be presented in  future ENISA work.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  1. INTRODUCTION  This ENISA study primarily aims to draw a comprehensive overview of the background and  current state of play of coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) practices across the EU  Member States and outside the EU. First, the study presents a summary of the existing or  planned national CVD policy initiatives along with good practices, challenges and  recommendations on policy attempts. Second, the study offers an analysis of national, regional  and global vulnerability databases, and presents the different practices on vulnerability and  registry management along with the formats, metrics and procedures used in these databases.  National CVD policies  A national CVD policy is a framework under which security researchers are allowed and  encouraged to research ICT products and services, following a set of rules, and report any  vulnerabilities they find to the national authorities or the product vendor. A national CVD policy  helps to increase the overall level of cybersecurity in a country and increases transparency. This  helps to build trust in the ICT services and products used in that country.  Intended audience  The study is meant to be a source of information for any CVD stakeholder having an interest in  the latest thinking on this topic. The intended audience for this report can be segmented into  different CVD expert groups. These groups include policymakers and national authorities  involved in coordinated vulnerability management initiatives; national Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs); and  actors from the private sector owning an open-source or commercial database who want to  learn about current CVD developments and good practices. Lastly, vendors and researchers are  invited to treat the study as a support document in their activities.  Policy context  The current policy and legal context concerning CVD policies and vulnerability databases at the  EU and international levels are framed by key developments such as the Budapest Convention  on Cybercrime (2001), the Cybersecurity Act (2019) and the upcoming Network and Information  Security 2 (NIS2) directive, where the proposal specifically states the involvement of CSIRTs in  the national coordinated vulnerability processes. Nevertheless, further clarification and  harmonisation actions are currently being discussed.  In addition, the NIS2 directive proposal describes the development of a European vulnerability  database to support organizations and suppliers in registering, disclosing and monitoring  vulnerabilities in ICT products and services. This vulnerability database will provide all  interested parties with access to information describing the vulnerabilities; the affected products  or services; the severity of vulnerabilities and the circumstances under which they can be  exploited; and the availability of a patch or, in the absence of one, guidance regarding what  steps must be taken by system administrators or users in order to mitigate the risks.  Methodology  The data collected through desk research related to CVD policy and registries helped  contextualise findings and draw observations. Furthermore, 19 interviews were conducted with  national competent authorities and CERTs. These interviews enriched secondary research and  enabled the extrapolation of key findings with evidence-based input. An in-depth analysis and  triangulation of the data collected resulted in key findings, a detailed description of analysis  outcomes on the current CVD state of play in the EU and recommendations on planned EU  CVD initiatives.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  Structure  The report includes the following main sections.  • ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies in the EU’, which focuses on national  vulnerability management policies, including information gathered from 19 interviews  with national competent authorities and EU Member States’ CERTs.  • ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies outside the EU’, which focuses on  vulnerability disclosure policies and practices in the United States, China and Japan  • ‘CVD policy practices’, which analyses desired elements of CVD processes based on  interviews with EU Member States, good practices observed within EU Member States  and an analysis of the challenges involved in developing a national CVD Policy  • ‘Recommendations’, which provides comprehensive recommendations related to the  issues addressed, aiming to improve the current state of play within the EU.  The information regarding the state of play of EU Member States presented herein was  collected between Q2 and Q3 of 2021. Any updates to that status since then will be presented  in future ENISA work.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  10  2. COORDINATED  VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE  POLICIES  2.1 STATE OF PLAY CVD POLICIES IN THE EU AND RELEVANT  COUNTRIES AND REGIONS OUTSIDE THE EU  This Section presents an assessment of the state of play, good practices and challenges in the  establishment of CVD policies across the European Union, and in some non-European  countries, namely China, Japan, and the United States.  The findings are based on analysis and complemented with inputs from interviews shared by  representatives from the Member States that either have a CVD policy in place, are in the  process of implementing one or do not have any CVD policy in place. In particular, the  interviews covered all countries that have established a CVD policy, most countries in the  process of establishing a CVD policy or on the point of establishing one and a selection of  countries with no CVD policy in place. The representatives to be interviewed were selected in  such a way as to guarantee an adequate representation while taking into account the various  regions and countries’ sizes. This information was complemented with a detailed analysis of the  best practices and challenges, particularly legal challenges, that should be highlighted in the  context of the establishment of CVD policies across the EU.  More specifically, this overview encompasses:  • the state of play CVD policies in the EU and a number of relevant non-EU countries  and regions outside the EU;  • an overview of good practices in CVD, including a template CVD policy and procedure,  bringing together the good practices and ideas collected from the different countries;  • an overview of challenges and issues, including technical, policy, economic and legal  issues;  • possible solutions and recommendations to address these challenges and issues.  2.2 STATUS OF CVD POLICIES IN THE EU  The state of implementation of national CVD policies across the Member States shows that  substantial differences exist among them. The research shows that while evolving in a  fragmented EU environment, multiple Member States are making progress in the  development of national CVD policies but at different rates.  The Netherlands lead the EU’s efforts in establishing CVD policies. Together with the  Netherlands, France, Belgium and Lithuania are the only countries which have a fully  established national CVD policy. Some Member States (4) are on the point of implementing a  policy. In these cases, the proposal is either being examined at the level of policymakers or is  being tested in pilot projects. Several Member States (10) are in the process of implementing a  national CVD policy or are on the point of doing so. However, failure to reach a consensus at  the political or legislative levels hampered the process. Finally, another group of Member States  (9) has not implemented a CVD policy and the process for establishing one has not yet  commenced.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  11  Most of the Member States without a CVD policy in place expressed the intention of establishing  one in the future, especially in the context of the national transposition of the NIS2 directive.  Very few Member States seem to be opposed to implementing a CVD policy. In some cases,  this is because current practices or legal frameworks in place in the countries already allow  CVD processes to take place even without a formal policy. Figure 1 and Table 1 provide an  overview of the implementation of CVD policy at the national level in the EU.  Table 1 – Implementation of CVD policy at the national level in the EU  Country Status CVD policy at  the national  level  Belgium Belgium has an established CVD policy that envisages full  protection of the researcher acting in the scope of an existing  policy.  Implemented  Bulgaria Bulgaria hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy, but the national  CERT is involved in the establishment of CVD practices.  Not  implemented  Czechia Czechia does not have a CVD policy in place. The national  CERT is assessing different options for reducing  vulnerabilities, including creating a national CVD policy.  In progress  Denmark Denmark is in the initial phase of its pilot CVD project. On the point  of  implementing  Germany Germany does not have a national regulation on CVD. A CVD  policy by the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik (BSI) is about to be published. It should  be regarded as the German national policy.  On the point  of  implementing  Estonia Estonia hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy. Vulnerabilities  are handled through an array of strategies that the country has  in place.  Not  implemented  Ireland Ireland does not have a policy in place, and implementing one  is not regarded as a priority.  Not  implemented  Greece Greece hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy but takes a  positive stance on the idea of establishing one.  In progress  Spain Spain does not have a national CVD policy. A CVD framework  has been partially established at the level of the Spanish  In progress  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  12  Government National Cryptologic Center - Computer Security  Incident Response Team (CCN-CERT) and INCIBE-CERT.  France France has an established CVD policy. Art 47 (art. L 2321-4  Code de la défense) creates a safe harbour for vulnerability  reporters when certain legal criteria are met.  Implemented  Croatia Croatia hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy and there is no  plan to implement one at this stage.  Not  implemented  Italy Italy does not have a CVD policy in place. Discussions on  amendments to the criminal code might be pushed forward in  light of the NIS2 directive.  In progress  Cyprus Cyprus does not have a formal policy for CVD in place. A  policy might be established in response to the more formal  obligation stemming from the NIS2 directive.  Not  implemented  Latvia Latvia does not have a CVD policy in place, but by the end of  the year the country will put in place a formal voluntary CVD  policy for state institutions.  On the point  of  implementing  Lithuania Lithuania has a national CVD policy in place, formalised in the  amendment to the law on cybersecurity of the Republic of  Lithuania.  Implemented  Luxembourg Luxembourg has no formal CVD policy in place. A CVD policy  has been released by the national CERT and there are  ongoing discussions on a CVD policy.  In progress  Hungary Hungary hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy. There are  ongoing negotiations regarding amendments to the Hungarian  cybersecurity act ,specifically to include vulnerability  disclosure requirements.  In progress  Malta Malta hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy and there is no  plan to implement one at this stage.  Not  implemented  The  Netherlands  The Netherlands has an established CVD policy that  guarantees full protection for researchers.  Implemented  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  13  Figure 1 presents a mapping of the state of play in the implementation of CVD policies in the EU  Member States. The map divides countries based on a scale of (1) to (4), where (1) indicates  that the country has a policy in place and (4) indicates that the country has no policy in place.  The values in between indicate either that the process of implementing a policy is in progress,  or that the country is just on the point of implementing one.  From the mapping of the state of play of CVD implementation, a geographical consideration that  could be drawn is the relative greater maturity of western European countries compared to other  European regions. Conversely, southern European countries and central and eastern European  countries are lagging behind in this process.  Austria Austria does not have a CVD policy in place at this time but is  considering whether to include a CVD policy in the national  transposition of the NIS2 directive.  In progress  Poland Poland does not have a CVD policy in place. In 2017, security  breaches were partially decriminalised to improve the  protection of researchers.  Not  implemented  Portugal Portugal does not have a CVD policy in place but a task force  has been established to develop a CVD policy. The task force  presented a proposal with a comprehensive list of legislative  amendments. The proposal is now being examined by  decision-makers.  On the point  of  implementing  Romania Romania hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy and no  progress in this direction has been made.  Not  implemented  Slovenia Slovenia hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy. The country is  planning to include a CVD policy in the next cybersecurity  strategy.  In progress  Slovakia There is no CVD policy in place, while at the legislative level  there are implicitly established processes regarding CVD.  In progress  Finland Finland has no CVD policy in place but it has begun efforts in  this direction. Besides, a CVD policy has been released by the  national CERT.  In progress  Sweden No CVD policy in place at the national level and there is no  plan to implement one at this stage.  Not  implemented  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  14  Figure 1 – Implementation of CVD policy at the national level in Europe  2.3 CVD WITHIN EACH MEMBER STATE  Belgium  Since 2018, the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (CCB) has worked in collaboration with  the Public Prosecution Service, the vulnerability reporter community, the private sector and  public authorities on the development of a national approach to CVD policies. The national CVD  policy is a formal policy explicitly included in the Belgian cybersecurity strategy (adopted by the  National Security Council and the Prime Minister’s Office) and in the CCB baseline security  guidelines (adopted by the CCB management). In 2019, the CCB adopted, as an example to  IMPLEMENTED  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  15  other organisations, a CVD policy for its website1. In December 2020, the CCB published  national guidelines to encourage all Belgian organisations to adopt a CVD policy or a bug  bounty2.  The policy promotes the adoption of coordinated vulnerability disclosure guidelines for private  and public entities and is divided into the following different documents: Guide part I – Good  practices; Guide part II – Legal aspects; an example of policy; a folder; and FAQs. The CCB is  in charge of the implementation of the national CVD policy and it provides a template of policy.  The national CVD policy attributes a role to the CCB (with its CERT team) as a CVD coordinator  by default (even when there is no CVD policy put in place by the concerned organisation). If a  vulnerability is not yet known and threatens to have a direct or indirect impact elsewhere, the  organisation responsible for identifying it must inform the CCB and the other organisations  potentially concerned, even if it does not want the vulnerability to be made public.  Without modification of the existing legal framework, those guidelines clarify the legal situation  of the researchers when the organisation has adopted a CVD policy and attributes a role to the  CCB (with its CERT team) 3 as a CVD coordinator by default (even when there is no CVD policy  in place).  In Belgium, a CVD policy or a bug bounty is considered as a type of accession agreement,  which is usually published on a website, outlining the contractual provisions between the  responsible organisation and the researchers (accepted by them when they freely decide to  participate in the policy). Subject to compliance with the mutual obligations described in the  policy, the adoption of such a policy implies an authorisation from the responsible organisation  for the researchers to access or to try to access, with good intentions, the concerned IT systems  to identify possible vulnerabilities or to provide any relevant information about the security of its  IT systems. Therefore, the access or the attempts to access those IT systems by the  researchers are lawful, as long as the pre-determined rules of the CVD are met. These rules  should ensure, among other things, the confidentiality of the information exchanged and provide  a responsible and coordinated framework for any disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities. The  term ‘disclosure’ does not necessarily mean that the vulnerability will be made public, but rather  that the participant communicates it to the responsible organisation. The participant is obliged to  communicate the vulnerability to the responsible organisation, but the public disclosure of the  vulnerability (by the participant or the organisation concerned) is optional and must be  coordinated. If a vulnerability is not yet known and threatens to have a direct or indirect impact  elsewhere, the organisation concernedmust inform the CCB and the other organisations that are  potentially involved, even if it does not want the vulnerability to be made public.  The CCB policy is presented in detail in the Annex.  There are quite a few organisations in Belgium that have a CVD or a bug bounty  policy in place: Roximus, Telenet, Voo, Base, SNCB, Brussels Airlines, Port of  Antwerp, VRT, Kinepolis, KUL, Randstad, Itsme, New pharma, Cybersecurity  coalition, Tomorrowland, Torfs and Dpg Media. Furthermore, there is an important  bug bounty platform (Intigriti) that is based in Belgium and has coordinated some of  those policies.  1 Centre for Cyber Security Belgium, ‘CCB coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy’.

CERT Bulgaria is, nonetheless, already involved in the establishment of CVD practices. CERT  Bulgaria uses an internal portal to which each of the users has access. The portal includes an  ‘installation database’, in which each user has indicated the type of software and hardware  employed. Daily information is collected from the US National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)  on newly discovered vulnerabilities. This information is matched with the installation database  and the constituents receive an email with vulnerabilities relevant to the software and hardware  it uses. The constituents can see the same information on their profiles by entering the portal.  In fulfilment of its proactive obligations, CERT Bulgaria prepares and sends monthly bulletins. It  publishes brief statistical information on the most recent attacks and/or threats with the most  important recommendations on how to counteract them and information on the published  vulnerability bulletins of Microsoft, CISCO, Adobe and others popular vendors used by our  constituents.  In this respect, while the 2020 national cybersecurity strategy5 does not mention CVD, the  document lays down the main measures that will need to be achieved to meet the security  objectives set out in the NIS directive. Among others, the strategy put forward the ‘development  of the minimum required capacity of the individual CERT/CSIRTs’ and ‘the expansion of the  scope, capabilities and functions of the Security Operations Center (SOC)’. In addition to  incident and attack response activities, SOCs cover all aspects related to cybersecurity, such as  awareness raising, resilience, detection, disclosure, crisis reporting and management.  Czechia  While there is no CVD policy currently in place, the National Cyber and Information Security  Agency (NÚKIB) is continuously assessing ways of reducing vulnerabilities, including creating  a national CVD policy. In 2018, the governmental CERT (part of NÚKIB) mentioned CVD as a  topic that the country needs to catch up with and in the National Cyber Security Strategy of the  Czech Republic (2021), there is a reference to a ‘coordinated approach of private and public  entities in cybersecurity’. In the proposal of the Action plan for the national cyber security  strategy of the Czech Republic for the period from 2021 to 2025, there is a task to prepare a  proposal for a national CVD policy in 2021. Also, in the 25 Years of the Czech Republic’s OECD  Membership report, the country pledged to include CVD as a tool that should be adopted in  national programs and standards.  Furthermore, the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency has established close  cooperation with selected private companies to exchange information about cybersecurity  threats, trends and best practices. The National Security Agency has an agreement on the  government’s security programme with Microsoft and Cisco, under which ‘the parties can share  and exchange cybersecurity information, which means that the NSA has access to these  4 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G.

However, by no means could this  memorandum of understanding substitute establishing a CVD mechanism.  Denmark  Denmark has not yet implemented a CVD policy; however, the country is in the initial phase of  its pilot CVD project.  As part of the Danish Cyber and Information Security Strategy 2018–2021 (initiative 1.7), a draft  on a governmental CVD policy framework has been prepared. The strategy mentions that  communications concerning cyber threats are the responsibility of the Danish Centre for Cyber  Security in collaboration with the relevant sectoral authority. Communication will need to be  coordinated in the event of a major, cross-sectoral incident, under the responsibility of the  central operational communication staff (DCOK). ‘The DCOK is responsible for ensuring rapid  disclosure and coordination of relevant information to the general public, including to the  media’ 6. No further details are provided in the strategy.  Germany  Formally, Germany does not have a national regulation on CVD. The German Federal Office  for Information Security (BSI) has, nonetheless, a policy in place which will be published after  approval by BSI management and the relevant ministries. Processes related to reporting within  the federal administration to the BSI and by the BSI have been established for dealing with  vulnerabilities (cf. § 4 Paragraph 2-4 BSIG). According to this, all federal authorities must report  to the BSI any information in connection with newly identified vulnerabilities that are important  for the performance of tasks or the security of the information technology of other authorities.  All the vulnerabilities found are reported to the affected manufacturer via the BSI so that they  can act accordingly. The aim of the procedure is to minimise damages resulting from the  possible exploitation of vulnerabilities. On the one hand, the coordinated participation of  affected manufacturers enables functioning security updates to be provided. On the other hand,  the temporary retention of vulnerability and attack details reduces the potential damages.  Currently, the BSI policy should be regarded as the German national policy, as this authority is  the focal point for CVD. In this context, it is not expected for other public entities in Germany to  publish another formal CVD policy.  The Bundeswehr (German armed forces) has also published, on 21 October 2020, its  vulnerability disclosure policy 7. The policy applies to Bundeswehr IT systems and web  applications that are connected to and accessible over the internet, particularly the websites of  the Bundeswehr 8. The program affects all digitally accessible systems of the Bundeswehr, i.e.  their hospitals (Berlin, Koblenz, etc.), universities (Munich and Hamburg) and others.  This policy cannot be used to prepare or transmit vulnerability reports in third-party programs  without the consent of the Bundeswehr.

GERMANY – Bundeswehr vulnerability disclosure policy 9  The Bundeswehr published its vulnerability disclosure policy on 21 October 2020. Whenever a  vulnerability is discovered, researchers should proceed as follows.  • Before you report, find out about the cases that do not fall within the scope of our Bundeswehr  vulnerability disclosure policy and are not dealt with in this context.  • Use the contact form to get in touch with us about the security problem or send your results by  email to security@bundeswehr.org. Encrypt your documentation with our Pretty Good Privacy  (PGP) key so that this sensitive information does not fall into the wrong hands. To optimise  communication between you and the central reporting office in the Bundeswehr, we ask you to  use the format template provided.  • Do not exploit the vulnerability or problem by, for example, downloading, changing or deleting  data, or uploading code.  • Do not pass on information about the vulnerability to third parties or institutions unless this has  been approved by the Bundeswehr.  • Do not carry out any attacks on our IT systems that compromise, change or manipulate  infrastructure and people.  • Do not carry out social engineering (e.g. phishing), (distributed) denial of service, spam or  other attacks on the Bundeswehr.  • Provide us with sufficient information so that we can reproduce and analyse the problem. Also,  provide a contact option for questions.  Bundeswehr commitments include the following.  • We will try to end the vulnerability as soon as possible.  • You will receive feedback from us on the receipt of your report and on your report.  • If you follow the instructions of the Bundeswehr security policy, the law enforcement authorities  will not be informed of your connection to the findings. This does not apply if it is evident that  criminal or intelligence intentions are being pursued.  • We will treat your report confidentially and will not pass your personal data on to third parties  without your consent.  • We will inform you of the receipt of your report, as well as the validity of the vulnerability / IT  security gap and the elimination of the problem during the processing period.  • The finder is judged according to his abilities and not according to age, education, gender,  origin or social rank. That is why we show this respect publicly and recognise this  achievement. In addition, if nothing else is desired, we will describe the closed vulnerability  and the name (or alias) of the discoverer on our ‘thank you’ page, to publicly express our good  cooperation with the Bundeswehr.  9 This section draws from the vulnerability disclosure policy of the Bundeswehr (VDPBw).

Estonia  Estonia has not yet implemented a CVD policy and the Cybersecurity Strategy for 2019–2022 of  the Republic of Estonia does not elaborate on possible mechanisms for CVD 10.  However, vulnerabilities are handled through the array of strategies and institutions that the  country has in place. For example, the Department of Standards and Supervision has overseen  the development of a new standard on information security (which should be enforced in  January 2022). The supervisory authority regularly oversees public sector institutions on  standards’ implementations. Besides, the Department of Analysis and Prevention carries out  cybersecurity analysis based on the data gathered by the national CERT and conducts  prevention campaign (e.g. yearly awareness-raising campaign on cyber hygiene). Estonian  private companies and academia are active in vulnerability disclosure, but the cooperation  between these actors and the governmental agencies is not formalised.  In 2018, after the Return of Coppersmith’s Attack (ROCA) vulnerability in the eID systems was  discovered, the Estonian Information System Authority (EISA) suggested vulnerability  disclosure as a possible solution to prevent these types of incidents from happening again. In  particular, EISA mentioned that ‘anticipated sources of information – international notification  mechanisms and notification from vendors – failed Estonia this time while the information  provided by an international group of researchers allowed to address the issue’. The notification  mechanisms are designed for incidents with significant impact and thus not ideal when  addressing vulnerabilities in earlier stages of crises, as in the case of ROCA. According to EISA,  the episode could have allowed to revisit the notification mechanism, involving vulnerability  sharing to be addressed jointly 11.  Ireland  Ireland does not have a policy in place and does not consider implementing such a policy as a  priority.

According to the issued decree, the CCN-CERT will provide the public  administrations with the following services.  • Support and coordination for treating vulnerable aspects and solving security incidents  taking place in the General State Administration, regional administrations, entities  comprising local administrations and public law entities with their legal status, that are  linked to or depend on any of the preceding administrations.  • Information about vulnerable aspects, alerts and warnings of new threats to information  systems, gathered from different sources of renowned prestige, including own sources.  INCIBE-CERT is the reference security incident response centre in Spain. Art. 11.1 a) 2º and b)  of the decree-law for the NIS transposition15 establishes the role of INCIBE-CERT as the  reference CERT/CSIRT for private companies and the citizens. Among the different services  that INCIBE-CERT provides to these subjects, there is the coordination of vulnerabilities.  Art. 11.2 of the decree-law establishes that the CERTs/CSIRTs will coordinate with each other  and with the rest of the national and international CSIRTs in responding to incidents and  managing security risks. The security risks include the managing and coordination of  vulnerabilities. INCIBE-CERT provides support to those who want to provide information on  vulnerabilities detected in either INCIBE-CERT or third-party systems, for private companies  and citizens.

SPAIN – INCIBE-CERT CVD policy17  INCIBE-CERT sets out the actions that are not allowed in the search for  vulnerabilities.  • Using social engineering.  • Compromising the system and persistently maintaining access to it.  • Changing the data accessed by exploiting the vulnerability.  • Using malware.  • Using the vulnerability in any way beyond proving its existence. To demonstrate that the  vulnerability exists, the reporter could use non-intrusive methods. For example, listing a  system directory.  • Using brute force to gain access to systems.  • Sharing vulnerability with third parties.  • Performing DoS or DDoS attacks.  The INCIBE-CERT also sets out the steps that should be followed to report a  vulnerability, i.e. send the (ideally) encrypted information to incidencias@incibe- cert.es  The following information is required to report a vulnerability.  • A clear and detailed description of the vulnerability.  • Clear and detailed information on how the vulnerability was discovered. The objective is to be  able to reproduce it.  • Other information that may be useful when reporting the vulnerability, such as proof of the  existence of the vulnerability (screenshot, link, etc.); timeline or some information about the  moment the vulnerability was discovered; any type of information deemed necessary to  locating and resolving the vulnerability in the fastest and most efficient way possible.  Once the notification is received, INCIBE-CERT will confirm receipt and begin  communication with the interested party. If the vulnerability involves a Critical  Infrastructure Operator, INCIBE-CERT also has different contact points to  facilitate communication and ensure the notification has been correctly received.  In addition, its specialised technical team offers support to mitigate and resolve  the vulnerability as soon as possible. Once the vulnerability is communicated,  periodic follow-ups are carried out until the standard term set by the INCIBE- CERT. Whether the management of the vulnerability is successful, or if the actor  responsible for managing the vulnerability has not taken sufficient measures to  remedy it within 60 days, INCIBE-CERT will issue a notice publishing the  vulnerability together with the reporter if he wants. Researchers are not  16 CVE numbering authorities (CNAs) are organisations from around the world that are authorised to  assign CVE IDs to vulnerabilities affecting products within their distinct, agreed-upon scope, for inclusion in  first-time public announcements of new vulnerabilities.

Nonetheless, if the person reporting  the vulnerability desires, it will offer its communication channels as a promotion  for the disclosure.  France  France has established a CVD policy in 2016. If a researcher reports a suspected vulnerability  to theAgence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI)18, Art. 47 of the Law  for a Digital Republic supersedes Art. 4019. Art. 47 exempts the researcher (‘goodwill person’)  who reports the vulnerability from the provisions contained in Art. 40. The agency must also  protect the confidentiality of the identity of the researcher who reports the vulnerability20.  Art. 47 (art. L 2321-4 Code de la défense) creates a safe harbour for vulnerability reporters  when two legal criteria are strictly met, constituting a statutory derogation to French criminal law  (Art. 40 Code de procédure pénale).  1. Researchers reporting a vulnerability must act in good faith i.e., either knowing that  they act within the boundaries of the legal framework, or that they reasonably ignore  that they are acting outside of the legally authorised scope.  2. Vulnerabilities must be reported to ANSSI exclusively – no other public institution can  receive a vulnerability notification and meet Art. 47’s legal criteria to create a safe  harbour.  When those two criteria are strictly met, the following applies.  1. Vulnerability discovery will not be prosecuted even if it should normally amount to a  crime.  2. ANSSI can protect the vulnerability’s owner identity and anonymise the vulnerability  report and any information relating to the vulnerability’s discovery.  ANSSI oversees the implementation of the law and provides guidance and procedures allowing  researchers to benefit from the safe harbour. Besides, ANSSI contribute to the registration of  vulnerabilities to MITRE when coordinating vulnerability disclosures with both researchers and  vendors. CERT FR provides a list of security alerts, including vulnerability information, however,  vulnerability reporting is limited to a set of organisations operating in France and having incident  response teams.  Notably, a comprehensive CVD policy inspired by current state-of-the-art recommendations  (ISO norms, etc.) is currently under review by ANSSI.

The latest National Cyber Security Strategy of the Republic of Croatia is from 2015 and  does not mention responsible disclosure or CVD21.  Italy  Currently, Italy does not have a CVD policy in place. The Department for the Digital  Transformation within the Presidency of the Council of Ministries in 2018 (named Digital  Transformation Team at that time) drafted a CVD policy that aimed to be general and potentially  able to cover both the private and public sectors. The work has been carried out in collaboration  with the national CERT. A pilot programme aimed at supporting private companies in  implementing CVD policies and improving internal/external processes has been prepared, but  since then no progress has been made due to the lack of legal certainty regarding the protection  of researchers.  Within the discussion around the NIS2 directive, the discussion on CVD picked up and some  players that were against changing the legal code seem now to be more inclined towards  introducing a CVD policy. Italy is proposing an amendment to the text of NIS2 directive aiming  at facilitating the establishment of a CVD policy within Member States, by the time the NIS2 will  be received for the national transposition. The proposed amendment to the NIS2 text states that  the Member States should define the conditions according to which the identification and  disclosure of vulnerabilities would not entail a breach of criminal law. According to Italy, leaving  the discretion to the judges in deciding what constitutes unauthorised access to a system would  be alarming as every judge would have the freedom to establish, according to his parameters,  what should be considered ethical hacking and what should not  Many private companies, such as the TIM Group (formerly Telecom Italia Mobile), have CVD  policies in place and published on their website. However, according to the current penal code  in Italy, these companies would still be able to sue the security researchers.  Cyprus  Cyprus does not have a formal policy for CVD in place, although a policy might be established  in response to the more formal obligation stemming from the NIS2. The country has  consolidated the national CSIRT through the development of appropriate procedures and  information exchange interfaces for the effective response to and management of incidents.  Incident response mechanisms have been identified and codified in relevant secondary  legislation, but no CVD is envisaged22. The Cyber Security Strategy of the Republic of Cyprus  2020 mentions that ‘in addition to exchanging information regarding threats and cyber incidents,  information exchange about systems’ vulnerabilities should also be promoted, offered by the  Cypriot market, in coordination with companies and customers vulnerability disclosure’23.  21 Republic of Croatia Ministers of Interior (2015), ‘The National Cyber Security Strategy of the Republic of Croatia’ (Official  Gazette No 108/2015).

The handling and management processes  will instead be implemented by the national CSIRT.  Latvia  Latvia does not have yet a CVD policy in place, but the country is in a transition phase. Indeed,  by the end of the year, Latvia will put in place a formal policy encouraging state institutions to  implement a CVD policy. This will provide state institutions with a policy template and will  designate responsible entities that will be in charge of the implementation of the policy. For now,  there are some institutions and organisations that have voluntary CVD published. CERT Latvia  has led by example with the publication of its vulnerability disclosure policy.  Initially, the policy will be voluntary and CERT.LV will provide support during the implementation  and act as a coordinator among the involved parties in the CVD process. After the report is  published, the implementation steps will continue in close cooperation between the Ministry of  Defence (MoD) and CERT.LV.  Besides, the latest Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia (2019) envisages the definition of a CVD  policy. ‘Following the principles described in National Defence Concept,’ the strategy reads, ‘it is  necessary to develop regulations on responsible security vulnerability disclosure, which are  important for ICT security, addressing of gaps and vulnerabilities and encouraging system  designers and operators be more responsible (Activity 2.1)’24.  Already since 2016 Latvia has been taking steps towards the definition of a CVD policy. In 2016  the MoD proposed to address the responsible disclosure policy (RDP) / CVD process via  legislation. In particular, the proposal intended to specify the responsible disclosure process in  the law on IT security. This proposal attempted to address the lack of a framework establishing  the steps to take after a vulnerability was discovered by a researcher, and the lack of protection  for researchers. A multi-stakeholder working group was established to discuss the best  approach to include RDP in the law. Legal experts, security researchers, cyber policy experts,  CERT.LV and several other groups and institutions were represented in this working group.  Unfortunately, the proposal failed to convince all involved parties and was not accepted.  Retrospectively, according to representatives from the MoD of the Republic of Latvia, it can be  admitted that the proposal was cumbersome. This is also one of the reasons why the policy  framework that is currently being proposed is voluntary.  Some organisations in Latvia have published their CVD policies, for instance, in the  banking sector JSC Swedbank (as early as 2015) and JSC SEB Banka. CERT.LV  has led by example with the publication of its vulnerability disclosure policy.  LATVIA – CERT.LV responsible disclosure policy 25  We support responsible security vulnerability disclosure policy and principles and welcome any  security researchers to report security flaws in the CERT.LV services and resources (cert.lv  domain).

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in the CERT.LV services,  please contact us at cert@cert.lv and include the following information:  • a detailed description of the vulnerability;  • detailed information about the exploitation of the vulnerability;  • if applicable, a link, screenshot or any other information that could help to identify the  vulnerability you have found.  We prefer that you use CERT.LV PGP key (https://cert.lv/en/contacts) to protect the information you  are sending. We will keep you updated while we solve the issue and inform you when the  vulnerability is fixed.  What do we expect from you? It is important that you follow good practices.  • You should not use the vulnerability to access or attempt to access information that does not  belong to you (only to prove the existence of the vulnerability).  • You should not use the vulnerability to remove or modify the information.  • You should not affect the availability of our services through denial of service (DoS) attacks.  • You should not make any social engineering attacks.  • We would appreciate you letting us fix the reported vulnerability before going public with it.  What does CERT.LV offer?  • We do not offer monetary compensation, but when the issue is solved CERT.LV can help to  prepare information for publication and promote the researcher’s contribution if that is mutually  agreed upon.  If you found a vulnerability in other institutions’ services, please contact us at cert@cert.lv (please  use CERT.LV public PGP key: https://cert.lv/en/contacts).  Lithuania  Lithuania has a national CVD policy in place which has been adopted through the Republic of  Lithuania Law on Cyber Security and its amendments regarding CVD policy formalisation. The  law entered into force on 28 June 2021. All ministries were involved in the approval of the law.  For example, the Ministry of Justice, Prosecutor General’s Office and Police department  provided indications on the conditionalities for the researchers’ activities to be established. They  asked in particular to set not only the right to search for vulnerabilities but also to set an  obligation to notify the relevant organisation about the search being performed. Concerning the  implementation of the law, the MoD designated the National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC –  national CERT) as coordinator.  It is important to note that the CVD policy in Lithuania does not apply to vendors but only to  cybersecurity entities (CSEs) that are the owners of assets that the vulnerabilities are being  found on. The NCSC does contact the vendor though, in case a vulnerability is found in a  product that might be used by other parties (and the essence of the vulnerability is not a  misconfiguration or a vulnerability that is already known). Nevertheless, the NCSC has no right  to oblige the vendor to take any action if the vendor is not a CSE.  IMPLEMENTED  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  26  Voluntary vulnerability disclosure mechanisms were already applied by organisations in  Lithuania (e.g. JSC Ignitis group or the Vilnius municipality administration). According to a report  facilitated by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Center (GCSCC), a (voluntary) vulnerability  disclosure framework was already in place in 2017, based on which ‘organisations have  established their processes and mechanisms to receive, disseminate and share information on  vulnerabilities’26.  Furthermore, the Order on the approval of the rules on the insurance of security and integrity of  public communications networks and public electronic communications services already  required that ‘providers of public communications networks report certain types of security  incidents’. In this context, different CSIRTs in the country, such as CERT-LT, were provided with  ‘mechanisms in place to share information including specific timeframes’27.  Nonetheless, there was no vulnerability disclosure practice applied on a national level, which is  why ordinary citizens or ‘white hackers’ had limited opportunities to share or report such  vulnerabilities found in other information systems, especially from a legal point of view.  As such, in 2020, the Ministry of National Defence started drafting an amendment to the  Republic of Lithuania Law on Cyber Security (hereinafter ‘the amendment’). The amendment  determines the following restrictions, that apply to a search of vulnerabilities, and that define  what makes it legitimate.  1. The operation, functionality, services and data availability or integrity of the communication and  information system may not be disrupted or altered.  2. When a vulnerability is identified, the search activity is terminated.  3. Within 24 hours of the start of the search activity, information on search results must be submitted  to the NCSC under the Ministry of National Defence or CSE.  4. It is not unnecessarily sought to validate, monitor, record, intercept, acquire, store, disclose, copy,  modify, corrupt, delete, destroy data managed by a cybersecurity entity.  5. No attempts are made to guess passwords. Passwords obtained illegally are not used and  employees of the CSE or other persons who have the right to use non-public information relevant  to the search for loopholes are not exploited or manipulated in order to obtain the information.  6. Information about the detected vulnerability is shared only with the NCSC under the Ministry of  National Defence or CSE and made public according to the amendment.  Only if all those requirements are met would the search for vulnerabilities be  regarded as lawful. Failure to comply with at least one of those requirements would  lead to an application of criminal liability.  Luxembourg  For now, Luxembourg has no formal CVD policy in place.

The  possibility of creating, in the near future, a platform at GOVCERT.LU that encourages  researchers to report bugs, especially those associated with vulnerabilities, will be analysed’.  The strategy defines the strategic objectives that should be achieved in the next 4 years and will  be complemented by an action plan outlining concrete measures to be implemented following a  definite time frame, and the actors called on to contribute to their implementation. The High  Commission for National Protection will provide the action plan to interested parties upon  request.  Besides, the national CERTs have been charged with the operational objective to monitor  threats and vulnerabilities and to make the results available to all Luxembourg actors 28. The  Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL), in its role as CERT for the  Luxembourg economy and municipalities, sets out the procedure for vulnerability disclosure for  its constituency 29, receives reports about new vulnerabilities in software and hardware products  or discovers them.  In the context of the public sector, i.e. governmental and institutional actors and critical  infrastructures, designated according to national legislation, Luxembourg’s governmental  CERT (GOVCERT) launched in 2019 a hall of fame30 and implemented an informal policy on  disclosure31 in alignment with the National Cybersecurity Strategy III 32. However, in  GOVCERT’s experience, the hall of fame has not provided sufficient incentives to encourage  widespread reporting. Indeed, since the service is online, only a few vulnerability reporters  reached out and even fewer vulnerabilities have officially been brought to the attention of  GOVCERT.  LUXEMBOURG – CIRCL step for responsible vulnerability disclosure33  The Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL), in its role as CERT for the  Luxembourg economy and municipalities, sets out the procedure for vulnerability disclosure for its  constituency, receives reports about new vulnerabilities in software and hardware products or  discovers them. CIRCL can receive vulnerability notifications from named or anonymous reporters.  In some cases, CIRCL discovers the vulnerability within the frame of a specific incident analysis or  report. Notifications can only be received by the standard report process of CIRCL. The use of  PGP34 is recommended while exchanging information about the vulnerability. CIRCL expects from a  clear statement from the reporters on whether they want to remain anonymous. By default, the  reporters will be mentioned to the software or hardware vendor.  CIRCL expects from reporters a reasonable effort to ensure that the report is complete and includes  enough information for the vendor to evaluate the vulnerability report.

This notification is considered the initial notification. The default delay  for the vendor to resolve the vulnerability is 30 days, starting from the initial notification. If the vendor  cannot fulfil within 30 days, the vendor must provide to CIRCL an explanation why he cannot correct  the vulnerability within that time frame. Under such a condition, an additional grace period can be  requested. CIRCL and/or the reporter will review the explanation and CIRCL will find an agreement  with the vendor if possible. A request for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) assignment  is done at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by CIRCL if the vendors are  not known to have an existing CVE assignment procedure.  Publication by the vendor  If the grace period is over, the vendor publishes the vulnerability, along with patches or updates to  correct the vulnerability. The publication can be done via the official public vendor channels or  security channels.  Publication by CIRL or/and the reporter  If the grace period is over and the vendor does not provide an acceptable answer, CIRCL and/or the  reporter will publish the information of the vulnerability.  Hungary  Currently, in Hungary there is no CVD policy in place. Last year, the National Cyber Security  Centre of Hungary (NCSC HU) has suggested initiating a process for establishing a CVD policy,  but the proposal faced opposition from the government.  At the moment, there are ongoing negotiations about amending Act L of 2013 on electronic  information security of state and local government bodies (Hungarian cybersecurity act) to  include vulnerability disclosure requirements for institutions falling within the scope of the act 35.  Currently, system owners are obliged to undertake vulnerability scanning on their systems and  to manage the mitigation process, along with maintaining a database about their vulnerabilities.  Automatic black-box vulnerability scan systems36 help these system owners in the process. The  system owners are mandated to share the relevant information with the CSIRT only if an  incident occurs. The National Cyber Security Center of Hungary is also publishing a  recommendation about vulnerability disclosure requirements.  Besides, due to COVID-19, the NCSC HU developed a vulnerability scan process on healthcare  applications. The NCSC HU is operating this process by connecting the medical institutions and  the application developers and by ensuring cooperation between the parties in the mitigation  process. Public disclosure is not part of the NCSC HU coordination process, and it depends on  the willingness of the developers.  Notably, together with the Netherlands and Romania, Hungary launched the Global Forum on  Cyber Expertise (GFCE) initiative for CVD. The objective of the initiative, launched in 2016,  35 Act on the Electronic Information Security of Central and Local Government Agencies (Act L of 2013/Information Security  Act) (2013).

Participants to the initiative have undersigned the CVD manifesto, committing to implement  public reporting mechanisms on vulnerabilities in their ICT systems and calling upon other  organisations to do the same. The manifesto aims to make all parties more aware of the  importance of cooperation to improve cybersecurity. Furthermore, the program aims at  developing a draft memorandum on CVD, at promoting the importance of CVD during  conferences and high-level meetings and at strengthening a CVD network38.  The initiative in the GFCE laid the groundwork for a joint project of four participating States  (Czechia, Hungary, the Netherlands and Romania) aiming at operationalising the relevant  confidence-building measure of the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) at  a regional level. The project encourages responsible reporting of vulnerabilities affecting the  security of / in the use of ICTs on a voluntary basis.  Malta  Malta has not yet implemented a CVD policy. The Malta Cyber Security Strategy 2016 mentions  that ‘the possibility of a national responsible disclosure policy framework may also be explored.  The framework would need to establish the right parameters and conditions to ensure its  effectiveness’. According to the report, the framework could be enabled through ‘self-regulation,  promotion and encouragement by the government, as well as through a proper framework to  ensure responsible vulnerability disclosure’.  The Netherlands  The Netherlands has had a CVD policy in place since 2013. The Netherlands has led the EU’s  efforts in establishing CVD policies and heavily contributed to supporting other Member States  in their efforts to address their own challenges and concerns. It is a formal policy although there  is no reference to CVD in Dutch law. The closest to an official policy is the beleidsbrief OM,  loosely translated, the ‘policy letter of the public prosecutor on CVD’. The public prosecutor  plays an autonomous role and has the discretion to decide when to prosecute. In this context,  historical judicial cases have established the boundaries within which a security researcher can  operate.  Since 2013 the National Cyber Security Centre of the Netherlands (NCSC NL) has received  and processed hundreds of reports39. Many organisations in the country have actively adopted  CVD and have been satisfied with the results. Even though there are vulnerability reports of  minor or theoretical issues, there are some important reports that would not have been found  otherwise and could, if abused, have had major adverse effects on the security of the  infrastructure or customer data.  37 Cybil, ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (GFCE Initiative)’.

Austria  Austria does not have a CVD policy in place at this time. CERT.AT provide on their website a  section for incident reporting, both in the context of obligatory/voluntary reporting according to  NIS law, and in the context of spontaneous reporting, while no section is dedicated to laying  down a CVD mechanism.  During the NIS1 transposition process, establishing a CVD policy was regarded as unnecessary  given that the national law already allowed for disclosure. Currently, Austria is considering  whether to include a CVD policy in the national transposition of the NIS2 directive. According to  the national CERT, there is a spectrum of vulnerabilities based on the type of data that are dealt  with. For some vulnerabilities (e.g. those including personally identifiable data)40 there might be  the need for a CVD legal baseline, whereas with the majority of discovered vulnerabilities the  national law would be sufficient. It also depends on whether the vulnerability is in common off- the-shelf software, bespoke software or reachable services on the Internet.  Some private companies are fostering the sharing of vulnerabilities according to established  best practices. For example, A1 Telekom Austria runs a bug bounty program. Everyone is  eligible to participate in the program, subject to the conditions and requirements of A1 Telekom  Austria41.

AUSTRIA – Borealis vulnerability disclosure policy (42)  Borealis, an Austria-based international provider of advanced and circular  polyolefin solutions, published on this website a guide for researchers on how to  disclose vulnerabilities. The policy sets out steps and requirements for users,  researchers and the company itself. Borealis is requiring that all users:  • make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to  production systems and destruction of data during security testing;  • perform research only within the scope set out below;  • use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to Borealis;  • keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between the user and  Borealis for 90 days while it is used by Borealis to resolve the issue.  The steps for a responsible disclosure are:  • send your findings to infosecurity@borealisgroup.com and encrypt them to prevent this critical  information from falling into the wrong hands;  • do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example by  downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or  modifying other people’s data;  40 The PI system collects, stores and manages data from your plant or process. You connect your data sources to one or  more PI interface nodes. The interface nodes get the data from your data sources and send it to the PI Server.  41 Open Bug Bounty (2021).

Error! Bookmark not defined.  Poland  Currently, there is no consistent policy for managing security vulnerabilities such as CVD in  Poland. The 2018 cybersecurity strategy refers to the possibility for relevant CSIRTs to publish  information on significant incidents, when it is necessary to prevent an incident from occurring,  or when, for other reasons, disclosure of the incident is in the public interest43.  The issue of reporting vulnerabilities has been partially covered by the National Cybersecurity  System Act. In addition, in 2017, security breaches were partially decriminalised to improve  researchers’ protection (Articles 269b and 269c of the penal code)44.  The CSIRT NASK (Research and Academic Computer Network) team receives reports of  vulnerabilities regularly and finds them as part of software security research. CSIRT NASK  approaches each case individually and does not strictly follow the Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure process proposed by CERT/CC45. Sometimes, the centre cooperates with foreign  institutions that can help in contacting software or devices’ vendors.

However, a task force including the Portuguese  National Cybersecurity Centre (CNCS), public authorities and stakeholders from the  cybersecurity community was convened to work on a proposal for establishing a policy at the  national level which anticiptes the need to amend the criminal law. The task force presented a  proposal with a comprehensive CVD policy and legislative amendments. The proposal is now  being examined by decisionmakers.  In 2020, the CNCS also developed a National Cybersecurity Framework setting out a relatively  long list of security measures and standards that organisations can use to perform a risk-based  approach to tackle cyber threats. This framework includes information on setting processes to  receive, analyse and respond to vulnerabilities disclosed from internal and external sources46.  This allows willing organisations to implement their own process to receive, analyse and verify  the submission of vulnerabilities. In terms of process implementation, the document states that  organisations should do the following.  • ‘Make available a process to report vulnerabilities, both internally and externally’.  • ‘Provide a process to receive security alerts, recommendations, bulletins from vendors  and suppliers, interest groups and others’.  • ‘Consistently evaluate, treat and respond to each submission’.  The pieces of evidence that should be provided (by the organisation) are the following.  • ‘Support document for vulnerability management process’.  • ‘Records from past subscription to technical interest groups’.  • ‘Records of receiving and treating reported vulnerabilities’47.  Notably, it is in the view of the CNCS that each vendor should put in place its CVD policy and  establish its own rules. The planned role of the national CERT would be to oversee the  communication between the parties and check if the whole process is carried out consistently  with the national guidelines. The CERT would, therefore, act as the mediator.  Finally, the National Cybersecurity Centre and the DNS.PT Association (referred to as ‘.PT’)  jointly launched Webcheck.pt48, an initiative to promote the adoption of good practices and  standards contributing to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of the internet. As promoters  areresponsible for the maintenance of the Webcheck.pt platform, .PT and CNCS allow the  interested communities to perform security tests and disclose results under the terms and  conditions outlined in the website’s policy49.  Romania  Romania initiated, together with the Netherlands and Hungary, the GFCE initiative for CVD with  the objective to share experiences and lessons learned in CVD. According to ENISA, the  National Cyber Security Directorate (NCSD) participates in the initiative on CVD, ‘having  46 Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre (CNCS) (2020), National Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.0 EN, April.

The GFCE website mentions, among the expected outcomes of initiatives, the draft of a CVD  policy at the national level in Romania51. No advancement in the GFCE initiative seems to be  currently on the way.  Slovenia  Slovenia has not yet implemented a CVD policy. The country is planning to include a CVD  policy in the next cybersecurity strategy. A CVD policy will likely be included in an amendment  to the Information Security Act, which transposed the NIS Directive into national legislation and  was adopted in 2018, or even as a new act considering the NIS2 directive transposition into  national legislation.  Most likely, the envisaged responsible body will be the national CERT. The Information Security  Administration will also conduct awareness-raising campaigns aimed at tackling the entities that  have been opposing the establishment of a CVD policy in the past.  Indeed as of 2018 the SI-CERT had proposed to add this topic to the upcoming law on  information security, while no consensus for support was reached at that time. The highlighted  challenges related in particular to the awareness of decision-makers at the political level on the  current best practices in the information security community52. The 2018 Information Security  Act did not make any reference to CVD, although providing that competent national authority  ‘may inform the public about individual incidents … when disclosure is in the public interest’53.  The 2020 Digital Slovenia Strategy for the Information Society54 does not make any reference to  CVD neither.  Slovakia  Slovakia has not yet implemented a CVD policy. However, a CVD policy mechanism is available  in Slovakia at the level of CERT. In 2019, the SK-CERT has published its ‘Vulnerability  Reporting Guideline’ 55.  The National Cyber Security Centre SK-CERT published this guideline as a recommended  procedure for vulnerability reporting. The guideline is also suitable for vulnerability reporting in  products and services of the National Security Authority and SK-CERT.  On a legislative level, while there is no CVD policy in place, there are implicitly established  processes regarding CVD.

The Cybersecurity Act (CSA)56 mentions ‘vulnerability’ only as part of ex ante security measures  mandatory for essential services providers and the public sector. The delegated Act.  no. 362/2018 then elaborates more on the importance of establishing the ex ante security  measures on the known vulnerabilities and processes of revision. The delegated Act  no. 436/2019 Coll. requires to check if the vulnerabilities and the vulnerability revision processes  are present in the security measures and documentation. The delegated Act no. 166/2018 Coll.  binds the CSIRT teams to safeguarding confidentiality once a vulnerability is discovered during  their operations.  Thus, while a CVD policy is not present, it might be subsumed under Art. 8 of the CSA which  constitutes the single point of contact regarding the cybersecurity issues for essential services  operators and the public sector. The kind of cyber security information that the constituency  should be reporting to the established single point of contact is broadly defined. Therefore, even  vulnerability reports might be included. Although, they are not explicitly mentioned.  Finland  Finland has no CVD policy in place at this time and there is no mention of vulnerabilities in the  law. That said, they do appear to be making efforts in this direction.  In 2010, the National Cyber Security Center Finland (NCSC FI) had published a vulnerability  coordination policy as an effort to spell out their position and to initiate a discussion on the topic.  According to representatives from the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency  (Traficom), the policy published in 2010 was not widely implemented across the country.  However, the overall good situation with vulnerability management in the country could explain  the limited application of this CVD policy.  Nevertheless, the policy has been used as a policy template to help vendors evaluate their own  policies. It is envisaged that it will be updated and promoted at the level of decision-makers to  form a national CVD policy, especially in the context of the new provisions that will stem from  the NIS2 directive.  The role of CERT FI should also be mentioned. According to ENISA, there are three CSIRTs  that have ‘extensive experience with coordinating vulnerability disclosure. These are CERT FI in  Finland, JP-CERT in Japan and CERT-CC in the United States. The work carried out by these  coordination centres is widely recognised and it is recommended that since they already have  the know-how they should continue to lead these activities’57.  CERT FI acts as coordinator in the process of vulnerability disclosure. The aim of the centre is  that the information about vulnerabilities, related patches and updates, reaches all involved  parties, including the end users of products. CERT FI ensures that as many major vulnerabilities  as possible are patched and that fixes are applied. As a vulnerability coordinator, it promotes  56 European Commission (2019), Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019  on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology  cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (Text with EEA relevance)  PE/86/2018/REV/1, Brussels, 7.6.2019  57 ENISA (2015), Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure – From challenges to recommendations.

CERT FI handles about 50 vulnerabilities every year.  Private organisations operating in Finland, such as the Cisco Product Security Incident  Response Team58, acknowledge the collaboration with third-party coordination centres such as  CERT FI to manage a coordinated disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to them and impacting  multiple vendors59.  CERT FI sends information and news about vulnerabilities to customers on an almost daily  basis and researches Finland’s situation when a newly released vulnerability seems like it might  affect Finland. The Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability is a good example of this type of  activity. CERT FI was mapping the situation in Finland when the vulnerability was released. The  centre contacted every vulnerable organisation via email or direct phone calls. Over a month, all  the vulnerable exchange servers (300) in Finland were patched.  Moreover, the ‘white hat hacker’60 ecosystem in Finland is quite active and CERT  FI receives a handful of vulnerability notifications/reports from them every year.  The bug bounty programs are also popular in Finland.  Sweden  Sweden does not have a CVD policy in place at a national level and there is no plan to  implement one at this stage. The 2017 national cybersecurity strategy61 does not provide any  indications for developing CVD mechanisms.  The Swedish national CSIRT, CERT-SE, gets involved in 5–10 cases per year, where CERT- SE preferably supports the resolution of vulnerabilities by helping reporters reach the  manufacturers, guids reporters and manufacturers to business standard procedures and, if  needed, acts as an intermediary between the two.  Sweden-based companies such as Swedbank, Northvolt or Klarna appreciate security  researchers and encourage them to report potential vulnerabilities identified in any product,  system or asset and offer responsible disclosure program guidelines62. Other companies use  private initiatives like HackerOne or OpenBugBounty to be notified about vulnerabilities and  interact with reporters.  2.4 CVD OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION  This Section provides an overview of the CVD-related practices outside the  European Union, in particular, it explores the latest trends in the People’s Republic  of China, the United States of America and Japan.

China’s process is one ‘in which high threat vulnerabilities are  likely evaluated for their utility in intelligence operations before they’re published [on the  Chinese National Vulnerability Database], and the publication is made or delayed for these high  threat vulnerabilities based on whether they can be operationally useful to the [Ministry of State  Security] whether for domestic surveillance or foreign intelligence operations’65. It is likely that  the Chinese government holds on to high value vulnerabilities to be used for national security  goals. One reason to believe that is the delay in publishing these vulnerabilities compared to the  lower-threat ones: from 21 to even 156 days longer. For instance, the vulnerability CVE-2017- 0199 of Microsoft Office was revealed by Chinese databases with a delay of nearly 2 months –  sufficient time to exploit this software vulnerability and launch attacks against other countries or  organisations. It is no coincidence that this same vulnerability is at the heart of both WannaCry  and NotPetya attacks.  In 2020, the Chinese government was looking at introducing specific rules on how to disclose  vulnerabilities, and to require researchers to report them to authorities before making them  public. It is a crucial issue because media, in this manner, are limited from publishing any  vulnerability details before they have been communicated to the competent authorities. This  limitation weighs on companies and individuals who will receive information with a significant  delay66. In 2019, there were various thefts of high-profile data in Chinal, such as internet café  customers’ information or sensitive medical data. Therefore, the official reason for the massive  government presence was the need to not compromise national security and public interests. At  the same time, it was required that Chinese nationals assisted the cyber efforts of the country67.  Already in Article 7 of the cybersecurity law (2017) citizens are required to support and  cooperate with national intelligence services. This assistance to the institutions becomes explicit  in the regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products (2021)  which will be explained below.  To better understand the new law on vulnerability disclosure, it is helpful to briefly describe the  current Chinese cybersecurity legal system. The Chinese cybersecurity legal system is  organised in a pyramid with the national security law of 2005 at the top and the cybersecurity  law of 2017 one step below it. The cybersecurity law, approved since 2016, aims to safeguard  the Chinese ‘cyberspace sovereignty’ by strengthening existing regulations that concern cyber  activities. For instance, companies that did not store their data in China at that time had to  purchase cloud sharing services to avoid heavy fines68. The network security is the goal set to  protect citizens’ rights and interests, safeguard national security and promote economic  development. To achieve network security, the law requires network owners and network  operators to adopt security measures such as security incident recording or the establishment of  security management bodies. In addition, companies supplying network products and services  in China must comply with the mandatory national security maintenance requirements. Those  that do not comply with the cybersecurity law may receive fines up to 1 000 000 RMB  (132 719 EUR69), face an arrest of operations and even incur the revocation of business  64 O’Neill, P. H.

The cybersecurity law confirms and consolidates the passage from elective regimes  toward obligatory standards and requirements in the cybersecurity field.  At the bottom of this legislative pyramid, stands the data security law and the abovementioned  regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products, both entered into  force at the beginning of September 2021. The latter has many implications, which are explored  below.  Regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products  On 1 September 2021, new regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in  network products came into effect. They have been drafted and updated for two years, since  2019, before their official release.  In these 2 years there have been six rounds of updates and implementations, which indicates  the great interest that the various ministries have in this area. The first three steps were  necessary for the Chinese government to incorporate the various opinions of interested  stakeholders. The regulations were introduced on 19 June 2019; the opinions of the community  have been accepted since 10 August 2019; and in November the Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology (MIIT) held a forum for enterprises, seeking advice, and to collect  opinions from the industry. The fourth round, from December 2019 to December 2020, was the  most important one because it involved a long negotiation between the MIIT, the Ministry of  Public Security (MPS), the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the network  operators. Following this negotiation, the articles of the regulations increased from 8 to 16.  Finally, from December 2020 to May 2021, the final draft of the legislation has been submitted  to the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission for the final review and the regulation was  officially issued simultaneously by the three ministries (MIIT, CAC and MPS) on 13 July 2021.  The regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products is not the  only law that came into force on 1 September, as the new regulations to protect the critical  information infrastructure, were also released. They underline the importance of network threats  and vulnerabilities along withcybersecurity monitoring, handling and emergency response. As  already mentioned, the data security law also became effective, giving network operators a few  directions on how to perform security protection obligations to protect networks from  interference, damage or unauthorised access, and prevent network data from being disclosed,  stolen or tampered with. The latest noteworthy act is the personal information protection law, the  Chinese version of the general data protection regulation (GDPR), which focuses on the  governance of Internet platforms and provides for an emergency plan in the event of personal  information security incidents.  The management and security vulnerabilities law  The regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products find their  legislative basis in Article 22 of the cybersecurity law: ‘when a provider of network products or  services discovers security defects or vulnerabilities in its network product or services, it shall  take remedial measures immediately, inform users in time and report to the competent  authorities in accordance with relevant regulations’.  The competent authority is subsequently indicated in the Ministry of Industry and Information  Technology (MIIT). The law’s legislative intent is managing what they define ‘network products’,  i.e. all devices that can be connected to the internet. Product vulnerabilities are key because  they constitute one of the greatest threats to digital infrastructure security. In this view, the  regulation shifts the emphasis on network product providers who are responsible for ensuring  the cybersecurity of their products.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  38  They are required to fix security vulnerabilities of their network products, eliminate security risk  from the source of threats, prevent security incidents caused by malicious exploitations and  effectively support the high-quality development of the digital economy, consolidating the  security foundations of the rapidly developing digital society. More generally, four major  objectives can be recognised in this regulation: maintain national cybersecurity; regulate  vulnerability-related behaviours (standardise vulnerability discovery, reporting, patching and  release); clarify the responsibilities and obligations of the network product providers, network  operators and organisations or individuals engaged in vulnerability-related activities;  encouraging various entities to make full use of their technical advantages to discover, collect  and release vulnerabilities. There is a clear desire to standardise the behaviour of the various  actors involved but above all to avoid that information on vulnerabilities is managed  independently.  Another important aspect of the regulations is to define the role of the three Chinese ministries  that participated in the consultations prior to the publication of the new package of laws. There  is a clear division of supervision responsibilities that can be derived from Article 3 of the  regulations. The CAC is responsible for overall coordination of network product security  vulnerability management. MIIT, a strong ministry which can easily handle the product vendors  (included cars and airplanes companies), is responsible both for the comprehensive  management of network product security vulnerabilities and for the telecom and internet  industry network product security vulnerability supervision. Finally, the MPS is the ministry in  charge of combating illegal and criminal activities by exploiting loopholes according to the law. It  is responsible for the supervision and management of network product security vulnerabilities.  The collaboration between these three ministries is regulated by Articles 3 and 7 of the  regulations and can be divided into three areas. The first one provides real-time vulnerabilities  information sharing among three departments: the Network Security Threat Information Sharing  Platform of the MIIT, the National Cybersecurity Notification Center of the MPS and the Chinese  National Vulnerabilities Database (CNVD) of CN-CERT under the China Internet Network  Information Center of the CAC. The second one states that the security vulnerabilities of major  network products must be jointly evaluated and handled by the three departments. The last area  concerns the vulnerability registration platform managed by MIIT, which subsequently informs  the MPS and the China Internet Network Information Center.  As previously mentioned, one of the main purposes of the Chinese government is to use this  new regulation to standardise the behaviour towards the discovery and disclosure of  vulnerabilities. The goal is to ensure clear disclosure rules for the researchers, an almost  immediate fix by the product providers and effective verification of the repair by network  operators.  The law can be summarised as follows70.  • Art. 4 lists the red lines that demarcate the boundary of what organisations and  individuals shall not do. Three prohibitions should be mentioned. The first one is not to  compromise cybersecurity, i.e. no organisation or individual may take advantage of the  security vulnerabilities of network products to engage in activities that endanger  cybersecurity. The second prohibition is not to illegally collect, sell or publish  information about security vulnerabilities of network products. The third one regards  more generally hazardous activities and the right behaviour to avoid them. Together  70 Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission (2021), ‘Notice of the Minitry of Industry and Information  Technology and the States Internet Information Office of the Ministry of Public Security on Issuing the regulations on the  management of network product security vulnerabilities’. Available at: http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021- 07/13/c_1627761607640342.htm  http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/13/c_1627761607640342.htm http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/13/c_1627761607640342.htm  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  39  with the red lines and the prohibitions, the punishments for the misconducts can be  found in Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15.  • Art. 5 establishes a vulnerability reporting channel, which shall keep reception logs of  the network product security vulnerability information for not less than 6 months.  • Art. 6 encourages people to report vulnerabilities to network product providers.  • The Articles 7, 8 and 9 regulate the responsibilities and obligations for three different  entities, namely network product providers, network operators and reporters.  • Art. 7 concerns network product providers and the behaviours they must adopt. For  instance, they are required to share all vulnerability reports with the MIIT within two  days (7.2) and are encouraged to set up a reward mechanism for reported  vulnerabilities (7.3) as a sort of bug bounty program.  • Art. 8 is dedicated to network operators and contains only one paragraph regarding the  timely verification of communicated vulnerabilities and their repair in a short time. The  requirements are higher for the reporters, so as to exercise a strict control over them,  and they decrease with the network product providers, only to be minimized for  network operators. The reason is that in China the latter are state-owned companies,  hence, they are already directly regulated. Therefore, although the Article 8 is very  short, the level of control is not lower than the one exercised on reporters and vendors.  • Art 9 is dedicated to organisations and individuals who discover a vulnerability. It  prohibits researchers from disclosing vulnerabilities details before a vendor has had a  reasonable chance to patch and prevent cybersecurity risks (9.1). It prohibits  researchers from exaggerating risks associated with security flaws or using a  vulnerability to extort vendors (9.3). It prohibits the publication of programs and tools to  exploit vulnerabilities and put networks at risk (9.4). It prohibits disclosing vulnerability  details to ‘overseas organisations or individuals other than network product providers’  (9.7)71.  • Art. 10 regulates the procedure that network operators and product vendors must  follow to report any vulnerability they face. It mandates that any organisation, or  individual researcher, register their vulnerability reporting platforms with the MIIT  (which has the duty to notify the MPS and the CAC). It is important to distinguish that  the report is not anonymous for the companies but can be for the researcher when  they inform the company. Furthermore, these actors are encouraged to submit  vulnerability information to the relevant platforms of the MIIT and the CAC. Following  the red lines set in Article 4, the penalties concern respectively the three main actors of  the new regulations (product vendors, network operators and reporters) and the  hazardous activities.  • Art. 12 is specific to product vendors. It punishes both failures to take measures to  remedy or report network product security vulnerabilities and the circumstances  specified in Art. 60 of the cybersecurity law.  • Art. 13 punishes network operators if no measures are taken to repair or prevent  network product security vulnerabilities, also applying the situations specified in Art. 59  of the cybersecurity law.  71 Cinpanu, C. (2021), ‘Chinese government lays out new vulnerability disclosure rules’, The Record. Available at:  https://therecord.media/chinese-government-lays-out-new-vulnerability-disclosure-rules/  https://therecord.media/chinese-government-lays-out-new-vulnerability-disclosure-rules/  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  40  • Art. 14 addresses the penalties for reporters based on a misconduct collecting or  publishing information about network product security vulnerabilities and in Art. 62 of  the cybersecurity law.  • Art. 15 covers hazardous activities. It punishes those who use the security  vulnerabilities of network products to engage in activities endangering network security  or provide technical support for others to engage in activities endangering network  security by taking advantage of the security vulnerabilities of network products  (including the circumstances specified in Art. 63 of the cybersecurity law).  The new regulations aim on one hand to improve the working mechanism for vulnerability  reporting, evaluation, patching and release. On the other hand, they aim to strengthen technical  support with the construction of the Network Security Threat Information Sharing Platform of the  MIIT which will collect, evaluate and process vulnerabilities (and share information with the  other vulnerability platforms and ministries).  When it comes to data collection, the main one collects information from different platforms,  each dedicated to a specific sector: the China Academy of Information and Communications  Technology for common network product vulnerability; the China Software Testing Center for  mobile internet app vulnerability; or the China Automotive Technology and Research Center for  vulnerabilities regarding automobiles.  Implications of the new rules  According to some security analysts, the obligation to report all vulnerability details to the MIIT  within 2 days after the discovery is the most troubling part of the law72. In particular, they notice  that if other countries start imposing the same requirements on security researchers, it adds risk  in aggregating unpatched vulnerability data, creating an unprecedented treasure trove of  unpatched bugs for our adversaries to attack and steal. Another issue is represented by western  bug bounty platforms that have been working with Chinese security researchers for the past  years. The fear is that they will provide the Chinese government with a way to be aware of any  vulnerability disclosure programme that includes Chinese researchers who report weaknesses  (even from non-Chinese companies)73.  Furthermore, according to other analysts, these new rules will reduce any prior flexibility security  researchers had and will oblige them to share security research with the Chinese government.  This probably will not imply a rise in the volume of attacks but an increase in sophistication.  There will be repercussions on western organisations that are carrying out research and  development activities in China, since the Chinese government will identify the vulnerabilities in  their products before them74. Despite the fact that the provision allows the disclosure of cyber  weaknesses to foreign manufacturers, there is no guarantee that this will happen.  Japan75  In Japan, the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities in products such as software is performed  in accordance with the ‘Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline’ (hereafter  ‘Guideline’). This guideline is based on a 2004 notification from the Ministry of Economy, Trade  and Industry (METI) entitled ‘Standards for Handling Software Vulnerability Information and  Others’, which was amended in 2014 and 2017. The notification was renamed ‘Standards for  72 Balaji, N. (2021), ‘Zero-day bugs must be reported to government within 2 days of discovery – New Chinese IT law’,  CyberSecurityNews.

The  guideline was created and jointly announced in cooperation with several industry organisations,  namely the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), the  Japan Information Technology Service Industry Association (JISA), the Computer Software  Association of Japan (CSAJ) and the Japan Network Security Association (JNSA). It serves as  a recommendation to parties relevant to the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. The  recommended processes in the guideline are in alignment with ISO/IEC 29147:2014  ‘Vulnerability disclosure’. For the purposes of this document, vulnerabilities in products such as  software and firmware will be considered.  In this guideline, vulnerability reports from researchers are sent to the Information-technology  Promotion Agency (IPA), a policy implementation agency under the jurisdiction of METI  handling initial analysis and triage. After this process, the reports are sent to the JPCERT  Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC), an independent, non-profit organisation funded by METI for  coordination with the vendor/developer of the product. Once the vulnerability has been  addressed by the vendor/developer, an advisory will be published on Japan Vulnerability Notes  (JVN), typically in conjunction with an advisory from the vendor/developer. Through this  coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, a total of 1 875 advisories have been published on  JVN as of March 2021.  While this coordinated vulnerability disclosure process has worked fairly well, the number of  reports received has increased significantly over the past few years. Various factors have  caused this increase, among them being an increase in the overall awareness of security  vulnerabilities, in the number of researchers searching for vulnerabilities, in the number of  products available and in the availability of easy-to-use tools for vulnerability discovery. The  increase in reports has led to a process overflow where some reports are not being handled in a  timely manner. The guideline initially stated that all reported vulnerabilities must be coordinated  and subsequently disclosed on JVN after the vulnerability has been addressed. While it is  probably best to coordinate and disclose all reported vulnerabilities, regardless of their severity  or the number of users that a particular product has, this is not practical in practice. Also, since  this guideline has been published, many vendors/developers have become receptive to the  coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, but there remain vendors/developers that are not.  As a recommendation for creating a policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure, the  experiences in Japan lead to the following considerations.  • Incentive should be provided to researchers to report vulnerabilities to an organisation  that can directly address the vulnerability or at least coordinate with an organisation  that can address the vulnerability.  • Monetary incentive should also be provided (bug bounty).  • Recognition should also be provided (credit on an advisory).  • Incentives should be provided to vendors to support the coordinated disclosure of  vulnerabilities.  • Vendors should be allowed to promote their own actions to address vulnerabilities as a  good practice (market appeal).  • Third-party coordinators can also provide value in this process.  • Advisories should be published so that information can reach a wider audience.  • Support should be provided in the coordination process where multiple organisations  need to be contacted with a vulnerability (multi-party coordination).  • The coordination process should be clarified so that researchers know how a reported  vulnerability will be coordinated and disclosed.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  42  • Vendors should be taught how to create a coordination process so that researchers  know vendors will address reported vulnerabilities.  United States of America76  The US technical and security community has been concerned with vulnerability disclosure for  decades. In 2002, in what was not the first attempt to standardise CVD behaviour, an IETF draft  standard, prepared by research experts from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT), which  develops and promotes voluntary internet standards, noted that the issue had been ‘a divisive  topic for years’77. Security experts, industry leaders, and policymakers have sought to balance  the need to protect users from those who seek to exploit vulnerabilities, the rights and roles of  security researchers and those who make and maintain the systems that everyone uses. What  was once a contentious area rife with conflict has seen an emerging consensus in the United  States, with government policy and law supporting private-sector leadership. While there are no  one-size-fits-all solutions, there can exist best practices and accepted ways of handling  vulnerability information.  Early governament response to vulnerabilities: coordination and anti-hacking statutes  The initial approach to protect the public took two forms. First, the software and security  communities realised that software vulnerabilities required organised coordination. Following the  infamous Morris Worm that brought down much of the Internet in 1988 and demonstrated the  risks of vulnerable systems, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)  established the Computer Emergency Response Team, now known as the CERT Coordination  Center or CERT/CC. This organisation plays a number of roles in securing the internet,  including acting as a ‘trusted third party’ that could facilitate communication between the then  small but burgeoning security research community, and the relatively small number of software  vendors.  Early computer exploits in the 1980s also drove the government to punish bad actors in the new  and poorly understood domain, in an attempt to discourage their activities. The legislature  targeted malicious behaviour in the US anti-hacking statute, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  (CFAA). Passed in 1986 and amended in 1994 and 1996, the law can apply to anyone who  accesses a computer without authorisation, with criminal and civil penalties. This law is  controversial among cyber law scholars, and many early judicial interpretations set a very broad  scope that would include much potentially beneficial security research.  Software vendors could also use American copyright law to deter security research. The Digital  Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA 1998) was a landmark attempt to balance copyright and the  free flow of information in the internet age. Section 1201 of this law criminalises attempts to  circumvent access control to a copyrighted work, regardless of the intent, although there are  now recent exemptions to DMCA for security research. Since much software is copyrighted  under US law, and basic technical protection measures are often included, this law has been  used to threaten and prosecute hackers who have identified vulnerabilities in software. Some of  these vulnerabilities were used maliciously to the detriment of companies and innocent users,  but others may have been used more constructively. Both the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  (CFAA) and DMCA were used to threaten security research, and authorities ultimately had to  clarify what they meant.  76 This Section of the report was a contribution by Allan Friedman, Director of Cybersecurity Initiatives at the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), US Department of Commerce, to the 2018 CEPS Task Force  on Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe – see footnote (7).  77 Christey, S. (2002), Memo ‘Responsible vulnerability disclosure process’, Internet Engineering Task Force, February.  Available at: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  43  Chaos and contention  As the security community slowly grew in the early 2000s, the relationship between security  researchers and vendors grew worse in the US. While some disclosures were successfully  coordinated, often with little fanfare, there were enough high profile incidents to make trust a  real issue. There was real concern among the security community that vendors simply were not  taking software security as seriously as the researchers. For their part, vendors did not  understand the motives or actions of the security research community, and often had real  difficulty distinguishing between those who were attacking their software for malicious purposes  and those who had no ill will. CERT/CC still played an important role in facilitating disclosure,  but as an intermediary. They were criticised by both sides for being overly sympathetic and  allied with the other side.  Absent clear guidance, some security researchers worked to create their own broad policies.  Nomad Mobile Research Centre, a hacker collective, established their own policy in 1999 on  disclosure with windows of one week or one month depending on the severity of each case78. A  more famous one was posted to the BugTraq mailing list by respected hacker Rain Forest  Puppy as a response to complaints that researchers never notified vendors or gave them a  chance to respond. This policy gave a window of 2 (later 5) days for response from the vendor,  demanding regular communication but not setting a specific timeline on fixing the vulnerability.  The underlying debate was between private disclosure and full disclosure. The former was  criticised as ineffective, while the latter was condemned as socially irresponsible. This debate  was even picked up by the nascent academic research community on the economics of  information security, though they also failed to find an optimal response79. One low point in this  period of distrust can be seen in 2009, with a presentation at the security conference  CanSecWest preaching the mantra of ‘no more free bugs’, arguing that the legal and  professional risks of working with vendors outweighed the benefits of selling them to any paying  customer or simply disclosing them publicly80.  Collaboration and CVD  By the early 2010s, it was clear to many in the community that the status quo was not  sustainable. Security researchers were growing in number and wanted a safer ecosystem.  Vendors were beginning to appreciate the role of external researchers. Cooperation began  more explicitly as companies posted disclosure policies, and the idea of bug bounties spread  from a revolutionary concept to an emerging business practice.  The American government followed suit to help shore up collaboration, through a variety of  means. An early step was taken in 2013, when the Federal Trade Commission, the consumer  protection agency, filed a complaint against mobile device manufacturer HTC for failing to  employ ‘‘reasonable security’81. While numerous lapses were alleged, the fifth of five charges  was the failure ‘to implement a process for receiving and addressing security vulnerability  reports from third-party researchers’.  As the issue became more common, it became clear that the private sector could benefit from  clarity.

This process brought  together very diverse viewpoints, while emphasising that there was no one-size-fits-all solution.  Participants in this process developed a template disclosure policy to make it easier for  organisations to begin a CVD process; conducted research to understand researcher and  vendor motivations and concerns; and developed a framework for multiparty disclosure  involving vulnerabilities that affect multiple vendors.  Other government agencies followed in quick order. In 2015, the FTC included vulnerability  disclosure in the cybersecurity guide for businesses83. By the end of 2016, regulators like the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Highway Transportation and Safety  Administration highlighted CVD as an important part of cybersecurity guidance and best  practices for medical devices and modern vehicles. The FDA’s programme is particularly  noteworthy, as it establishes incentives for medical device manufacturers to learn about and  deal with vulnerabilities quickly, rather than avoid knowing about them.  Even the often-conservative Department of Defence (DoD) joined the CVD throng. In 2016, in  addition to their targeted bug bounty programme for the Pentagon’s website, the DoD  announced a CVD policy for all public-facing systems. Then Secretary of Defence Ash Carter  described it in common terms as a ‘see something, say something’ policy for the digital  domain’84.  As CVD practices spread across the American economy, the law had to catch up as well. In  October 2015, the United States Copyright Office recommended exemptions under the DMCA  for ‘good faith security research’ on the computer systems that are built into voting machines,  motorised land vehicles and implantable medical devices85. Researchers looking for  vulnerabilities in these categories of systems could no longer be targeted for criminal or civil  penalties under the DMCA – vulnerabilities in voting machines have since attracted strong  attention in the United States. The Copyright Office agreed with NTIA that copyright law may be  a poor vehicle for cybersecurity policy, and many anticipate that further calls will be made for the  Copyright Office to exempt other categories of systems for security research.  The US anti-hacking law (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)) still remains in force to  protect American computer systems, but the Department of Justice has acknowledged the  importance of securing the role of security research. In 2014, the Department issued guidance  for federal prosecutors contemplating charges under the CFAA. While there is no carve-out or  even any explicit reference to security research or disclosure, the guidance lists factors to  consider to ‘ensure that charges are brought only in cases that serve a substantial federal  interest’. The Cybersecurity Unit of the DoJ went further in 2017 by offering a Framework for  Vulnerability Disclosure Programs. The goal of this guidance was to assist in the development  of CVD programs to clarify ‘authorised vulnerability disclosure and discovery conduct, thereby  substantially reducing the likelihood that such described activities will result in a civil or criminal  violation of law.’  One common theme across the different legal and policy approaches to CVD is that they  acknowledge the inherent diversity in CVD programs, based on an organisation’s systems,  capacity and preferences. The DoJ guidance makes it clear that ‘different organisations may  82 Simpson, A.

CERT/CC still plays a role as a coordinator, but acting as a  single neutral party has not scaled as the digital world has grown and they now offer expertise  while supporting others in their efforts. CERT/CC joined a group of security experts to advocate  CVD’s inclusion in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a key security strategy and standards  document for the US economy. It is acknowledged in the 2017 2nd draft of the Cybersecurity  Framework Version 1.1, which notes the importance of ‘processes … established to receive,  analyse and respond to vulnerabilities disclosed to the organisation from internal and external  sources (e.g., internal testing, security bulletins or security researchers)’86.  Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) platform87  In autumn 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released the  binding operational directive (BOD 20-01) in support of better management and resolution of  software vulnerabilities. The purpose was to strengthen the cybersecurity of federal civilian  agencies by requiring them to establish policies that would allow external researchers to report  vulnerabilities. On July 30 2021, to consolidate this goal, CISA released a new service for the  disclosure of vulnerabilities: the vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) platform. This service  provides a website suitable for receiving vulnerability reports from both security researchers and  private citizens. The Platform is offered by CISA’s Cyber Quality Services Management Office  (QSMO) and provided by BugCrowd and EnDyna.  Along these lines, federal civilian agencies can benefit from QSMO shared services with  consequent savings on a development of independent systems. CISA has calculated savings on  government-wide costs of more than 10 million USD. Furthermore, thanks to the platform,  agencies can receive more information on their possible vulnerabilities that will help in  maintaining cybersecurity.  The service providers, BugCrowd and EnDyna, will be responsible for an initial estimate of the  reports received. Agencies can then devote their time to vulnerabilities that could have a real  impact. With this project, CISA wants to help the Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB)  agencies manage vulnerabilities in their informatic systems. The VDP platform makes it easier  for the FCEB to coordinate with reporters, helping secure information exchange and increasing  collaboration between the public and private sectors.  The process that led to the VDP included a comment period on the draft. Given the relevance of  the topic, for the first time CISA allowed a binding operational directive to be subject to public  comments before it was issued. Consequently, since November 2019, CISA has received many  suggestions for improvements, such as introducing legal parameters for the protection of  researchers or defining a mandatory timeline for vulnerabilities’ remediation. Jeannette Manfra,  assistant director of cybersecurity at CISA at the time, was clearly on the side of the research  community: ‘A VDP allows people who have “seen something” to “say something” to those who  can fix it. It makes it clear that an agency welcomes and authorizes good faith security research  on specific, internet-accessible systems’88. Finding and reporting a vulnerability for the common  good shouldn’t involve the risk of a legal action.  Currently, CISA coordinated vulnerability disclosure process consists of five steps89.  86 NIST (2017), Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity – Version 1.1 (Draft 2), December.

When receiving a report, CISA has the task of carrying out an initial  screening to ensure the presence of the vulnerability and that it has not already been  reported. After the first check, CISA can collect the report with all the relevant  information. A vulnerability report can be collected through CISA vulnerability analysis;  checking public information on software vulnerabilities; or through a researcher who  submits it.  • Analysis. In this part, CISA works together with the vendor(s) to study the vulnerability  by examining both the technical problems and the risks it could pose.  • Mitigation coordination. Continuing closely with the vendor(s), CISA will work to find a  way to fix the issue by developing a mitigation (for instance a patch or an update).  • Application of mitigation. Affected end users must test and apply the mitigation prior to  public disclosure. This happens at this stage.  • Disclosure. As a last step, CISA will notify affected users about the vulnerability  through its channels. It is important to underline that this phase is characterized by the  coordination between CISA, the affected vendor(s) and the source of the vulnerability  report.  After examining the behaviour that CISA intends to implement, it is necessary to assume the  case that a vendor is not responsive or does not establish a reasonable timeline for the  mitigation. In this scenario, CISA can disclose a vulnerability 45 days after the first attempt to  contact the vendor, regardless of the availability of a mitigation.  With the continuous increase and evolution of cyber threats, it is necessary for vendors to  become aware of their role and the support that security researchers can offer them. CISA is at  the forefront to help identify and implement the best practices in this process90.  90 Goldstein, E. (2021), ‘CISA announces new vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) platform’.

CVD POLICY PRACTICES  3.1 DESIRED ELEMENTS OF CVD PROCESSES  The next Section provides more detailed information, gathered through the consultation with  Member States, on the different elements of the CVD processes and procedures established, or  soon to be established, in the different EU countries.  Entities Involved  As mentioned in the Carnegie-Mellon’s ‘CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure’, certain roles are critical to the CVD process91.  • Finder – the individual or organisation that identifies the vulnerability.  • Reporter – the individual or organisation that notifies the vendor of the vulnerability.  • Vendor – the individual or organisation that created or maintains the product that is  vulnerable.  • Deployer – the individual or organisation that must deploy a patch or take other  remediation action.  • Coordinator – an individual or organisation that facilitates the coordinated response  process.  Interactions among these actors are illustrated in Figure 3.  Figure 1 – Visualisation of the Entities Involved in the CVD process  Source: Householder, Allen D., et al. The CERT guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Carnegie- Mellon University Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States, 2017, p. 15  91 Householder, A. D., et al. (2017), The CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Carnegie-Mellon University,  Pittsburgh PA, United States, p. 15  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  48  Most of the Member States anticipate the involvement of the national CERT and/or the national  cybersecurity authority in the CVD process with a coordination role. As already mentioned in the  previous Section, the mediation role is important for managing parties’ expectations in terms of  disclosure. The CERT can mediate the conversation between the parties to meet the needs of  the vendors and help to decide the appropriate time to disclose the vulnerability. Besides, the  involvement of the national CERT is considered central in all the cases in which the researcher  wishes to keep its anonymity, and in the cases in which the vulnerability is found in the CERT’s  constituency.  Among the tasks of the coordinator according to stakeholders consulted are: the identification of  stakeholders to involve in the process (e.g. when a researcher does not know whom to report  the vulnerability to); the management of information flows from reporting to the full disclosure  (e.g. when the vulnerability owner might hold a threatening or untrustworthy attitude towards the  researcher or when they decides not to address the matter and thus reject the treatment of a  vulnerability); providing security researchers with a protection and/or legal shield; setting up  cooperation rules in vulnerability management processes; ensuring an objective risk  assessment (e.g. by filtering low-quality reports from researchers not meeting expectations set  out in the CVD policy).  In some cases, the national CERT together with the community of security researchers will be /  is also responsible for the discovery process. For example, the Tallinn University of Technology  and the University of Tartu are very renowned in terms of cryptographic skills and have been  responsible, together with the national CERT, for the discovery of the abovementioned ROCA  vulnerability in the Estonian eID system.  In terms of communication and coordination, the parties involved can vary according to the  vulnerability discovered. In case a vulnerability is found in a specific database, the relevant  sectoral authorities usually participate in the CVD process. For public disclosure, private  companies can also be integrated into the process.  Finally, as shown in Figure 4, the entities involved vary among the Member States according to  whether the focus of the CVD policy is / will be on the public sector only. In this case, the  implementation of the policy is usually handled by the national CERT and the public sector  institutions that are willing to participate. For example, it could be up to the public institutions to  identify which resources can/should be tested (e.g. their website or their portal). However, it  should be noted that, even in the cases in which a national CVD policy does not focus on  private entities as such, private companies are usually allowed and encouraged to publish their  own CVD policy.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  49  Figure 2 – Entities Involved in the CVD process  Source: Interviews with EU Member States  Role of CERTs  Stemming from the consultations, two approaches can be identified concerning what role the  Member States envisage for the national CERT:  In some cases, the national CERT only acts as an observer. The entities involved in these  cases are simply the researcher and vulnerability owner. Only in cases where the vulnerability  owner does not respond to the researcher requests for contact will the CERTs come into play. If  needed, the national CERT can be present in the different steps of the process but, ideally, just  as an observer. In the case of multiparty CVD, the role of the CERT as a coordinator is more  relevant.  In other cases, the CERT rather plays a central role. The CERT is indeed in charge of the  implementation of the law and provides guidance and procedures allowing researchers to  benefit from the safe harbour.  Tools  The tool that most countries are planning to adopt or have already adopted is a dedicated  website for receiving requests for coordination/intervention, and to provide a template for  notification reports.  The implementation of a ticketing system has also been mentioned by several countries as an  established good practice. Every mail is sent to the ticketing system, as such, in case the  personnel is unavailable, all information will be logged. This pipeline should have permanent  support.  Custom tools with enhanced security have also been mentioned by several countries as useful  systems to be adopted in the context of a CVD process. The Estonian national CERT for  example uses and publicly provides on its website the Cuckoo Sandbox for automated malware  analysis, which has proved to be a useful tool in finding vulnerabilities.  On the assessment side, validation tools can be used (e.g. Burp suite) to verify the material  that is sent out. Burp is generally used for the reproduction and assessment of the severity of  the vulnerability.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  50  Besides, in a CVD process communication tools are needed, especially in multiparty  processes where there are requirements for ensuring the confidentiality of communications. In  this respect, communication systems that are pluggable, decentralised and exchangeable are  needed.  Mechanisms can also be established to find vulnerabilities through open-source intelligence  software. ShadowServer or Abuse scan the IP address and disseminate to the national CSIRT  the vulnerabilities found on the public IPs – those of Critical Operators for example – that are  shared with the national CERT.  In more general terms, the tools that are needed depend on the tasks to be performed. For  example, to analyse and exploit vulnerabilities, there is a need for a lab network where  vulnerable systems can be tested (e.g. testing whether the received report is trustworthy before  addressing the vendor).  3.1.2.1 Common Security Advisory Framework  In Germany, the BSI has in place a warning and information service system. This is a decade- old website where advisories are published daily. It can be regarded as an advisory database  accessible to the BSI constituency. More detailed information is instead sent to government  entities and critical infrastructures operators. This is one of the most important services that the  BSI provides to help its constituency with patch management. In this context, the drafting of the  advisories is crucial. The BSI has been very keen on fostering automation in vulnerability  management. Each advisory information should hence be machine-readable. Together with  national and international partners, the BSI is therefore working on a solution to make it easier  for users to find, evaluate and implement security advisories. The machine-processable format  for security advisories, the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0, will make a  decisive contribution to ensuring that companies can supervise and secure their systems. Two  tools, in particular, have been introduced in the context of the CSAF.  • CSAF Aggregator. It allows interested parties to get the relevant information in one  single repository, identify the advisory that should be prioritised in their specific case,  etc.  • CSAF Advisory Editing System. The tool has been developed by the BSI and is made  available to vendors to ensure that they can create and upload advisories on CSAF in  the future.  The BSI also strongly advocates for the establishment of a software bill of materials, at least for  the most critical vendors.  GERMANY – Advisories and bulletins92  According to the German Federal Office for Information Security, an advisory  (short bulk of information concerning the vulnerability) shall contain the following  information.  • Title or identifier of the advisory (e.g. systematically and consecutively numbered).  • Date of publication.  • Affected products, versions and configurations.  92 Federal Office for Information Security (2012), Recommendation: IT-producers – Vulnerability Handling –  Recommendations for software vendors, October.

If an advisory is updated, the additional or modified sections should be clearly  marked as an update. An advisory should not include any information that  allows technically skilled experts to exploit the vulnerability.  Awareness-Raising Campaigns  All consulted Member States expressed the intention of carrying out awareness-raising  campaigns on CVD, especially if the implementation of a national CVD policy will be  mandated. In terms of specific activities, the Member States mostly mentioned the following.  Publish guidelines to assist the involved entities on their respective roles, and guide the code  owners and researchers on how to handle the CVD process (e.g. guide companies that are  reluctant in accepting vulnerability reports or guide researchers on how to act if the vendors do  not replay);  Organise discussion fora to involve representatives of the cybersecurity community, relevant  state institutions, or Critical Entities Operators. In these communities, experts (programmers,  researchers, etc.) can gather and exchange relevant information or good practices. This helps  foster a favourable ecosystem for CVD. These communities are also used to train and manage  the expectations of partners during the CVD process;  Participate in international communities (e.g. the CERT network or the NIS Cooperation  Group), considered particularly valuable to discuss, among others, good practices, present draft  policies or analyse the criticality of specific vulnerabilities with a cross-border impact.  Acquire broad media coverage to raise awareness on particularly disruptive vulnerability  cases.  Examples of awareness-raising campaigns  In Hungary, cybersecurity awareness campaigns are carried out mainly using social media and  participation in awareness-raising campaigns at university educational fairs, and through e- learning courses for the NCSC HU sectoral constituency.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  52  The National Cybersecurity Centre of Lithuania holds quarterly events – the Cybersec  Breakfast – where presentations and discussions on different matters are carried out for about  200 representatives of public sector institutions. Some presentations on the CVD process have  been organised in this context. Similar presentations have been held in the context of the ‘Safer  Internet’ event.  In the Netherlands, there are several good practices in place in terms of awareness-raising  campaigns. Hack right is an awareness programme that addresses specifically young first  offenders (below 23 years old) and helps them understand their rights and duties. The  programme was established in 2019 after it was noticed that most cases arriving in court  involved young researchers. NCSC NL published a guideline on CVD policies, which has been  helpful for organisations implementing CVD. Besides, researchers in the Netherlands have  created the DIVD.NL a platform to report vulnerabilities, supported by volunteers, where they  established their code of conduct. DIVD.NL had, for example, an active role in the Kaseya case:  DIVD has been in a CVD process with Kaseya, who was working on a patch. Some of these  vulnerabilities were used during an attack performed by REvil. Kaseya and DIVD collaborated to  limit the damage wherever possible.  Operational and Crisis Management Activities  For most countries, there are no dedicated practices for dealing with CVD, and the same  procedures that the CERT adopts in the event of crisis management are applied.  In terms of operational or crisis management activities practices, most Member States referred  to the establishment of channels to share information about cybersecurity (incidents,  vulnerabilities, etc.). These channels usually include early warning systems where the contact  details of people operating in critical infrastructures are collected so that they can be contacted  in case of an emergency. For reporting from third parties that are not critical operators, the  Member States argued that due diligence should be guaranteed in contacting the relevant  person in the organisation (security officers, technical team, etc.). In any case, technical details  should never be sent to a generic email address. In some cases, specific sectoral information  groups are established.  For a limited number of countries (2), voluntary information sharing is also promoted at the  level of CERTs. According to some Member States, limited voluntary information sharing is due,  among others, to the sensitivity of vulnerability information. To foster voluntary information  sharing, the level of trust of critical operators should be enhanced (e.g. by ensuring  anonymisation of the information).  Some challenges have also been underlined by the Member States in terms of operational and  crisis management activities. According to consulted countries, from a crisis management point  of view, it is unlikely that the national CERT will receive a long-term heads-up about these  vulnerabilities, nor will it receive all the relevant information ahead of time. In this respect, the  problem with information sharing is that, on a global scale, it is very challenging to ensure that  every critical operator using a certain software gets the patch without any information being  leaked. In this context, what can be done is to inform the whole supply chain through a heads- up notice stating that something will be happening soon, so that all relevant parties are aware  that a process has started, without sharing all the details of the process.  Additionally, small countries have highlighted that the process of building capabilities in the field  of information security, incident handling and crisis management is still ongoing. As such, the  CERT’s capacities are in some cases still limited.  Examples of operational and crisis management activities  The Estonian national CERT is in contact with the service providers who are alerted each time  a vulnerability is found. The information on the vulnerability is also shared by the CERT with the  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  53  Analysis and Prevention Department which is responsible for establishing the connection  between the technical and the strategic levels. The Analysis and Prevention Department is in  charge of drafting a memo on the discovered vulnerabilities and circulating it within the Ministry.  Based on the level of criticality of the vulnerability, the Ministry decides whether to inform the  Cabinet. The Analysis and Prevention Department, hence, helps in the interpretation of the  technical details to make them understandable at the policy level. This mechanism is regarded  as an established best practice.  3.2 CVD POLICY – GOOD PRACTICES  After having assessed the status of implementation of CVD policies across the Member States,  good practices were collected in terms of national policies related to the processes they have  employed.  Firstly, internationally there are two ISO/IEC standards on CVDP: ISO/IEC 2914741 and  ISO/IEC 3011142. The first describes the procedure for disclosing a vulnerability, while the  second deals with the processing procedures for the reported vulnerability. The  ISO/IEC 3011142 also distinguishes between the different stages of the CVD process  (discovery, reporting, validation and triage, remediation, public awareness, deployment). These  two standards describe a complete model with the different aspects of a CVDP93. Besides, the  standard ISO/IEC 27005 on security risk management is also linked with the CVD process  insofar as, according to Clause 11 on ‘Information security risk communication and  consultation’, information security risks need to be communicated between responsible  individuals and stakeholders. A risk communication plan should be developed by the  organisation for both normal operations and emergency situations. The outcome of all this  should be a continual understanding of the organisation’s information security risk management  process and results.  Content of a CVD Policy  A series of good practices can be implemented when drafting a CVD policy. This Section  reports the most relevant.  Firstly, the policy must be implemented by individuals or bodies that can validly represent the  responsible organisation and should be adequately advertised. Its content should be easily  accessible to potential participants, preferably from the website of the responsible organisation.  A disclosure policy helps to define how the vendor will deal with the reported vulnerabilities. As  such, the scope of the policy – which sites, products, devices, services, systems or networks  are concerned – should be clearly defined. The CVD policy should be applicable to the vendors’  various IT systems and to their contractual commitments (suppliers, clients, subcontractors,  staff, etc.). If this is not the case, the policy must explicitly list third parties’ systems that are  excluded from the scope.  The policy should also contain a description of the mutual obligations of the involved parties.  Authorisation to access the computer system  The very existence of a CVD policy or a bug bounty program should imply that authorisation to  access the computer system has been granted to the participant. The coordinated vulnerability  disclosure policy will include provisions which, depending on their exact wording, may be  considered as explicit or tacit authorisations. As such, the vendor should point out that  researchers will not be sued if they stick to the ground rules laid out by the vendor.  93 Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (2020), Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies Part I – Good practices.  Available at: https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide20CVDP20part20I20Good20practices.pdf  https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide20CVDP20part20I20Good20practices.pdf  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  54  According to the German Federal Office for Information Security, in order not to scare  researchers, the vendor should not demand formal or legal agreements such as contracts, a  formal memorandum of understanding or a non-disclosure agreement. Vendors must, however,  state in the policy the conditions under which participants may or may not access the computer  system. The authorisation to modify or delete IT data depends on the way in which the  coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy has been drawn up.  According to the CCB, it is good practice to prohibit participants from using DDoS attacks or  social engineering attacks, compromising the system, and persistently maintaining access to it,  installing malware or viruses, stealing passwords, using brute force to gain access to systems,  sharing the vulnerability with third parties, etc. The policy should also explicitly exclude any  deliberate attempt to intercept, record or become aware of communications that are not  accessible to the public.  More generally, participants must commit to complying with the principle of proportionality, i.e.  not to exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is strictly necessary to demonstrate the security  problem. Participants should also commit not to keep the collected data of the responsible  organisation, including any personal data, longer than necessary.  Whenever these conditions are met and participants are complying with the terms of the policy,  the vendor should pledge to carry out its coordinated disclosure policy in good faith and not  pursue civil or criminal action against them.  Information required to report a vulnerability  A CVD policy must clearly state what information the participant must provide when reporting a  vulnerability. A clear and detailed description of the vulnerability shall be provided by the  security researcher together with clear and detailed information of how the vulnerability has  been discovered (actions taken, tools used). The objective is to be able to reproduce it. If  applicable, the participant should also report any relevant information such as proof of the  existence of the vulnerability (screenshot, link, etc.) and information about the moment the  vulnerability was discovered.  Confidentiality  ‘Coordinated’ means that a vulnerability is reported confidentially. As such, one of the essential  elements of a coordinated disclosure policy is respect for confidentiality: participants should  not share the information collected with third parties or disseminate it without the express  consent of the responsible organisation.  Procedural deadlines  Clear deadlines shall be set in the policy for each stage of the procedure. As soon as the report  has been received, vendors should send acknowledgements of receipt. During the process, the  participant should be kept informed with follow-up on the stage of the handling and  management processes.  To the extent possible, a deadline for fixing the vulnerability should be established. Ideally, the  solution should be developed within 90 days at the latest. However, such deadlines should  remain relatively flexible, depending on the complexity of the vulnerability, the number of  systems affected, the urgency or the seriousness of the situation.  Communication channels  Another pivotal aspect of a CVD policy relates to the point of contact to which the information  should be sent. A specific email address – such as vulnerabilitypolicy@organisation.com – can  be used for this purpose. Notably, common addresses such as info@company.com should not  be used for security-related issues.  mailto:vulnerabilitypolicy@organisation.com mailto:info@company.com  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  55  According to the CCB, the use of an online form is a practical way to receive information about  discovered vulnerabilities. This method has the advantage that the input and processing of data  and the sending of an acknowledgement of receipt can be done automatically.  According to the German Federal Office for Information Security, the vendor’s website shall  offer security-related information at a central position. Such security-related information should  contain the following.  • Vulnerability information (advisories on vulnerabilities not fixed yet, information  regarding possible workarounds and bulletins on vulnerabilities for which security  updates are available).  • Contact information specific for the security of products (email, phone including  services hours, public PGP keys and ‘IdenTrust Secure Email’ certificates of the  company to enable confidential communication on security issues).  • The company’s disclosure policy.  • Patches and updates.  • Supplemental documents (white papers, FAQ, etc.) regarding the secure usage of  products.  • A contact form allows the vendor to structure the information flow and to make certain  information mandatory. In addition, such a form supports the alternative to report  vulnerabilities anonymously. The company should decide if such a form is relatively  simple or more complex.  These webpages shall be protected using valid and verifiable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)  certificates to guarantee the authenticity and confidentiality of the information provided.  Reward to the security researchers  Offering a reward or public recognition could make the CVD policy more attractive for the  participants. Rewards could account for monetary compensation in case a bug bounty program  is in place. Bug bounty platforms operate as a marketplace intermediary. Vulnerability owners  can use a web interface to rapidly design a public or private bug bounty policy and publish it on  the platform. The rewards may even be purely symbolic.  Non-monetary rewards, credits and acknowledgements can be particularly appreciated and act  as an incentive for the security researchers. For example, the Netherlands rewards researchers  with a humorous T-shirt marked ‘I hacked the Dutch government and all I got was this lousy T- shirt’. Similarly, many organisations include researchers in a ‘hall of fame’ published on the  organisation website.  Possible public disclosure  Any disclosure of a vulnerability should be coordinated and synchronised between the parties to  allow the responsible organisation to resolve the vulnerability and to inform affected parties in  advance. Indeed, when a vulnerability is identified in a program, component, protocol, etc.  provided by a third-party, the responsible organisation shall notify them directly before any  public disclosure.  The same applies when the vulnerability threatens to affect other organisations using similar  technology, or in the cases in which the responsible organisation has provided other  organisations with the vulnerable component/components. In these cases, it is essential that a  report on the vulnerability and its resolution is provided to the parties concerned. In the case of  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  56  public disclosure, the vulnerability report and the solution should be published at the  same time.  The responsible organisation must envisage various means to inform its users, for example,  automatic system updates, the publication of security notices on its website or mailings with a  link to a specific internet page.  Established Good Practices in Member States CVD  Procedures  Besides the content of a CVD policy, the disclosure of vulnerabilities entails a series of  procedures that should be implemented for the policy to be effective. This Section provides a  brief overview of the procedures that should be envisaged in a CVD policy. Besides, it provides  an outline of the procedures in place in three Member States – Belgium, Lithuania, and the  Netherlands – considered among the most virtuous examples across the EU.  Overall, the objective of the disclosure policy is to enable the development and deployment of a  solution to remove the vulnerability from the IT system. After the researcher finds and reports  the vulnerability, unless legally or contractually obliged to do so, the responsible organisation  remains free to choose to develop and implement a solution. As mentioned, ideally, the solution  should be developed within 90 calendar days. While such deadlines should remain relatively  flexible, it is important to keep them to the strict minimum, especially if users of the affected  systems are at risk or if there are risks to the protection of personal data. If the organisation is  unable to solve the problem immediately, the IT system concerned should be taken completely  out of service temporarily. The supply chain and the multiple interdependencies between  information systems can complicate the time needed to develop a solution and deploy it.  During this phase, the responsible organisation must, on one hand, perform positive tests to  verify that the solution is working properly and, on the other hand, negative tests to ensure that  the solution does not disrupt the proper functioning of other existing functionalities (94). If the  solution is ready and the vulnerability would affect other organisations, it should be  communicated to the CVD coordinator as a matter of priority and before any public disclosure.  The responsible organisation should respect a reasonable period from this transmission before  a possible general disclosure to users, to allow operators of vital interest to implement the  solution as a priority. If one of the parties does not respond, the parties can always call upon the  designated coordinator, in general, the national CERT or the National Cybersecurity Centre.  Belgium  The procedures established by the CCB can be regarded as a good practice in the EU. Figure 5  and Figure 6 provide a detailed description of the different phases of the CVD process under the  CCB.  94 Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (2020), Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies Part I: Good Practices.  Available at: https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  57  Figure 3 – CCB CVD process (I)  Source: Centre for Cyber Security Belgium  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  58  Figure 4 – CCB CVD process (II)  Source: Centre for Cyber Security Belgium  Lithuania  The National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania has also put in place procedures that could  serve as a basis for the drafting of best practices at the EU level.  According to the centre’s policy, if the researcher decides to report the vulnerability to the  National Cybersecurity Centre – or the vulnerability owner does not reply to the researcher – the  cybersecurity centre carries out its evaluation of the vulnerability, informs the vulnerability  owner, and obliges the vulnerability owner to evaluate the vulnerability and prepare a  vulnerability remediation plan. If the researcher decides to report directly to the vulnerability  owner, there is no coordination involved (unless the vendor fails in responding to the  researcher’s request). In both cases, the researcher needs to act according to the rules  established in the law and share information about the research process he has conducted.  Private entities’ policies can envisage less severe requirements than those established in the  national law (even no requirements at all). Notably, private entities cannot establish stricter  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  59  requirements than those envisaged at the national level. In the case of multiparty disclosure, the  National Cybersecurity Centre is in charge of contacting all the interested parties that are  affected by the same vulnerabilities.  According to the National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania, given the reluctance of  vulnerability owners to respond to researchers, the involvement of the National Cybersecurity  Centre as a mediator in the process is particularly helpful, although as a more mature CVD  ecosystem will unfold, the involvement of the National Cybersecurity Centre in the process  could be reduced (see Figure 7).  Figure 5 – National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania CVD process – Role of  the coordinator  The Netherlands  The Netherlands is perceived as having established one of the most effective CVD processes in  the EU.  According to them, the most important success factor for the Netherlands has been the bottom- up approach that was followed to set up the current CVD process. The process started with  major banks and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the country feeling the urgency to  accommodate ethical hackers in finding vulnerabilities. The country noticed that if companies,  institutions or organisations are not faithful to individuals reporting vulnerabilities, it is difficult to  force them to implement/adopt a CVD system. Hence, rather than requiring companies to  establish a CVD policy (top-down approach), it is much more fruitful to stimulate an ecosystem  in which researchers/hackers know they are safeguarded judicially and that they are  acknowledged by society. At the same time, companies and organisations know that the rights  and duties of researchers have borders, as they are not allowed to abuse vulnerabilities for  whatever reason.  Other countries have highlighted a series of procedures that they have implemented that should  be regarded as best practices.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  60  • Talk to the vendor. Normally, vendors need to have processes in place for rolling out  the patches for the discovered vulnerabilities following the normal software update  cycle. Cooperating extensively with internal and external product experts also helps to  understand the product’s vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities details.  • Become familiar with the ethical hackers’ community and properly value its work, for  example by establishing bug bounty programs. In this respect, it has been argued by  some Member States that the informal CVD recognition program does not provide the  right incentives to be effective. Overall, it is important to manage the researchers’  expectations by clarifying which type of incentives/rewards they can receive.  • Isolate the information that is received by the researcher and the information that is  sent to the companies. Once an agreement between the two parties is established the  communication can occur independently from the coordinator.  • Implement the OECD’s good practices within the national strategy.  • Adopt the CSAF95 to reduce the time between patch release and patch application.  • Base the CVD policy on international standards such as ISO 29147 and 30111.  • Provide CVD stakeholders with a ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Toolkit’96 as operated by  NCSC UK since September 2021. This guide is dedicated to all organisations willing to  set in place a vulnerability disclosure process and governance. The document refers to  three main CVD aspects: Communication, Policy and Security.  3.3 CHALLENGES AND ISSUES  This Section presents an overview of challenges and issues related to the definition of  coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies in the EU. Legal, economic, policy and technical  challenges are addressed. During the interviews with Member States, to assess the challenges  that Member States face in setting out a CVD policy, they were asked to comparatively evaluate  to what extent the following challenges impede the establishment of a CVD policy in their  countries.  • Legal barriers. Security researchers face significant legal risk.  • Lack of cooperation amongst stakeholders.  • Government ambiguity concerning vulnerability exploitation. Government looking for /  stockpiling vulnerabilities to exploit as part of their law enforcement, intelligence and  national security activities.  • Limited market incentives. Incentives for security researchers to participate in  coordinated vulnerability disclosure programmes.  • Financial and human resources challenges. Lack of resources and skills, and costs of  implementation and operation.  Figure 8 shows that legal barriers and the lack of cooperation amongst stakeholders represent  the greatest challenges. 84 % of Member States (16) believe that legal barriers have a strong or  at least some impact in the process. Similarly, 89 % of Member States (17) consider the lack of  cooperation among stakeholders to either strongly or somewhat impede the establishment of a  CVD policy.  95 OASIS (2017), CSAF Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) Version 1.2.

According  to the OECD, legal challenges ‘are enabled by an overall legal environment that does not  sufficiently protect security researchers and by the behaviour of many vulnerability owners  threatening security researchers with legal proceedings when receiving reports’98.  There are several areas of legal challenges researchers can face.  • Criminal law. According to the Cybercrime Convention, intentionally accessing a  computer system without rights is a criminal offence. Since the cybercrime directive  (2013/49/EU) sets minimum protections, the Member States can adopt stricter rules.  • Copyright law. Researchers can breach copyright law when the information disclosed  entails portions of copyrighted code. The vulnerability owners can establish  exemptions, enabling the possibility of safe harbours.  • Data protection law. Researchers discovering vulnerabilities may access personal data  which could be interpreted as a breach of data protection law. Most vulnerability deals  with personal data, interest in reporting versus interest in data protection can clash.  • Contract Law. Bug bounty policies and in some cases vulnerability disclosure policies  represent the terms of a contract between the vulnerability owner and the researcher.  Breaching the terms of the contract entails legal liability and risks for the researcher,  • Export control legislation and regulation are often cited as a legal risk for researchers  as they may apply to tools and knowledge used to discover vulnerabilities.  As shown in Figure 10, the great majority (17) of Member States consulted consider criminal law  to be the most pressing legal challenge, followed by data protection law.  97 ENISA (2016), ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 – 15 top cyber threats and trends.

According to the existing legal provisions in place in most cases, anyone who  finds and discloses a vulnerability by scanning a system without prior authorisation is bound by  criminal law and other legislative clauses.  Both in the cases in which the researchers were actively searching for vulnerabilities and in the  cases in which vulnerabilities are found by accident during the normal use of a system, the  researcher might inadvertently gain access to critical data he was not supposed to gain access  to. In this context, disclosing vulnerabilities without prior authorisation is, hence, not allowed.  Notably, these are distinct cases from accesses where consent is granted in the form of pen  testing arrangements between parties.  But what is the link between finding vulnerabilities and criminal law? According to CEPS (2018),  from a criminal law perspective there are two questions relevant for the process of finding  vulnerabilities as opposed to reporting them. The first one is ‘a substantive one and concerns  the circumstances under which finding vulnerabilities may be associated with a criminal offence,  that of illegal access to information system’;the second one is ‘procedural and relates to the  conditions that need to be met for any crimes associated with finding vulnerabilities to be  prosecuted’99.  Regarding the first question, Article 2 of the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  (the Budapest Convention) mentions what should be meant by illegal access to an information  system when it states ‘Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be  necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed  intentionally, the access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right’. According  to CEPS (2018), this means that there are four conditions that need to be met for illegal access  to apply under the cybercrime convention: the person should have accessed the system  intentionally; that person should have actually had access to the computer system; that access  99 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G. (2018) ‘Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe: Technology, policies and  legal challenges – Report of a CEPS Task Force’, CEPS Task Force Reports, 28 June 2018, p. 42. Available at:  https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/software-vulnerability-disclosure-europe-technology-policies-and-legal-challenges/  https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/software-vulnerability-disclosure-europe-technology-policies-and-legal-challenges/  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  64  should concern either the whole or part of the computer system; and that person should have no  right to access the system’100.  Directive 2013/40/EU of 12 August 2013 (the cybercrime directive) reflects the Budapest  Convention and states that ‘when committed intentionally, the access without right, to the whole  or to any part of an information system, is punishable as a criminal offense were committed by  infringing a security measure’.  Therefore, as stated also by the OECD (2021), according to the Budapest Convention only  the unauthorised access should be considered as criminal offence. It follows that computer  system owners can authorise access through the publication of a vulnerability disclosure policy,  allowing for the protection of security researchers (a limited liability waiver).  When it comes to the second question – the procedural one – related to the conditions that  need to be met for any crimes associated with finding vulnerabilities to be prosecuted, several  countries mentioned during the interview that the interpretation of the intentions of the  researchers by the prosecutor should make it possible to adequately guarantee a level of legal  protection for the researchers.  The Netherlands is the most renowned case in Europe, where researchers are protected  based on a formalised prosecutorial discretion within defined boundaries. The prosecutor in a  case examines three aspects/questions: is the researcher acting in the interest of society? Are  the means used by the researcher proportional? Is the subsidiarity principle fulfilled (were there  other means to accomplish the same goal)? For example, brute-force attacks or entering a  system and waiting a long time to report the vulnerability are deemed criminal. If one of these  three aspects is not fulfilled, then it is expected that the judicial system will prosecute the  researcher.  Similarly, according to the Hungarian case-law, there is judicial discretion to decide whether the  ‘ethical’ hacking (in the lack of contractual basis) is dangerous to society or not. If it turns out  that the committed activity was not dangerous to society – therefore not a crime – the  perpetrator cannot be punished. Of course, in these cases, the court also takes further  conditions into consideration (e.g. the intent of the suspect and other factors).  Furthermore, the CCB has played an important role in clarifying in its CVD policy the  interpretation of how the current criminal law can be applied in a way that would allow for the  CVD process to take place and, similar to the Netherlands, the public prosecutor has clarified  the interpretation of the law.  Likewise, according to the BSI, a CVD policy can be drafted and published based on the legal  foundation already in place in a country. Criminal law only mandates the researcher to behave  in a certain way (‘to play by the rules’). The BSI’s CVD policy incorporates this principle by  establishing boundaries to the researcher’s behaviour. Aspects related to the level of detail of  the reporting could be critical (e.g. a researcher is required to not disclose some information that  might be useful for the public), nonetheless, legal challenges do not overall impede the  establishment of a CVD policy. Once the vulnerability is processed, there are no legal  hindrances to the process. To incentivise reporting without the fear of legal proceedings, the BSI  enables the possibility of anonymity via an ad hoc form on its website. Overall, even if reporting  to the BSI is not free of any legal consequence, the court always takes into consideration the  good intent of the vulnerability finder. Following a published CVD policy could be considered as  an indicator of good intent.  100 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G. (2018) ‘Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe: Technology, policies and  legal challenges – Report of a CEPS Task Force’, CEPS Task Force Reports, 28 June 2018, p. 43  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  65  The Ministry of Justice of Denmark has made a similar evaluation. According to this  evaluation, publishing a CVD policy is regarded as a statement from the vulnerability owner that  it will not pursue a legal proceeding if the security researcher acts within the framework of the  published policy. It is a limited liability waiver. In the event that there is a disagreement  among the parties, the decision is ultimately made by the court.  Therefore, considering the answers to both questions, the approach followed by some countries  in the EU of establishing a CVD policy without the amendment of the penal dode is coherent  with the Budapest Convention and could be considered sufficient to offer a safe harbour to  security researchers.  However, it is important to mention that since criminal law is a prerogative of Member States  and the cybercrime directive, as a piece of EU legislation, it affords only a minimum level of  protection. The interpretation of what constitutes illegal access varies among Member States.  Therefore, as mentioned by some other Member States, although the Budapest Convention  establishes that only unauthorised access to systems is prohibited – and as such, having in  place a CVD policy might be sufficient to guarantee some level of protection for the researchers  even without amending the legal framework – establishing a CVD mechanism needs to be  grounded on more specific criminal law rules concerning the discovery of vulnerabilities.  In particular, the legal framework needs to specify which cases would count as unauthorised  access. Hence, while organisations might authorise researchers to access their system and  prevent researchers from being legally prosecuted, to ensure trust in the CVD process,  guarantees at the institutional level should be established. As such, to promote a national CVD  policy the government must proceed with the necessary legal fundamentals.  Furthermore, there are also several Member States (8) that strongly advocate for an  amendment of the penal code in place in their countries or have already proceeded with  amending the criminal code.  In Lithuania, for example, before the implementation of the law on cybersecurity, the  researchers’ activities were considered a violation of criminal law. As such, the main purpose of  the law has been precisely to create a safe harbour for the ethical hackers to operate whenever  they act in line with the established obligations. The principles for the establishment of this safe  harbour and the rules of behaviour that the researchers have to respect have been taken up  also by the Prosecutor General’s Office and police department.  Analogously, while the French law does not provide immunity to criminal law or such in this  context for researchers, it envisages two protective legal frameworks that can account for partial  protection of the security researcher:  Article L 2321-5 of the French defence code provides a protected alert framework to the French  national cybersecurity authority when discovering a vulnerability. This authority does not have to  refer such alerts to Justice if some conditions are respected.  A whistleblower framework also exists (art 6 à 16 de la Loi No 2016-1691) but it is  more about ‘incidents’ than vulnerabilities.  Greece does not have the type of judicial exemptions described but means to establish one.  The country does have a constitutional provision (Article 16 Constitution of Greece) which deals  with the freedom of academic expression. This provision, while it cannot be interpreted as  granting a right to violate the existing criminal law, it is a basis upon which academics and  scientists are currently being protected in the execution of their duties. As mentioned, however,  Article 16 does not preclude the application of criminal law. There are also legal clauses related  to intellectual property rights that allow for a degree of flexibility when, for example, a protected  document is copied for academic or scientific research. The Greek system has, thus,  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  66  recognised the importance of academic expression, although the parameters for allowing  unauthorised access to systems for research purposes are yet to be defined.  According to Portugal, one of the main ideas when adopting a CVD policy will be to establish a  safe harbour for researchers (non-criminalisation of the researchers’ activities) when they  demonstrate good intentions. The national policy itself will be a framework that can be used to  check on the intentions of the researchers as it provides a series of indications on the steps that  researchers should follow to properly report a vulnerability. Besides, the researchers’ intentions  can be assessed by looking at the logs in the system where the vulnerability is found (e.g. which  kind of tools and techniques the researcher used to find the vulnerability).  In the context of the discussion on the impact of criminal law challenges, the Member States  have been asked whether national or EU jurisdictions address the protection of security  researchers and if they plan on establishing or have established legal immunity (through  criminal law exemptions, for instance) or judicial or prosecutorial discretion, based on an ex  post, case-by-case assessment.  Most of the consulted Member States (11) do not plan on establishing legal immunity by  amending the criminal code, hence the introduction of criminal law exemptions. In some  cases (6), as mentioned, Member States do not consider it necessary to amend the criminal  code because the protection of the researchers is / will be based on judicial discretion.  In some other cases, the Member States do not plan on amending the criminal law due to the  opposition that was faced in the past from the national governments and the state police. Given  that this represented one of the main stumbling blocks, countries are proceeding with the  implementation of a voluntary policy or including CVD in the cybersecurity strategy and raising  awareness on the topic. Very likely, they will move forward with amending the criminal law if the  provision of the NIS2 directive, which suggests that Member States adopt cybersecurity  strategies that include CVD policies, will create the right context to do so.  Data protection law  According to several responding countries, the data protection law is also relevant, as it requires  the balancing of the rights for the protection of personal data when somebody identifies a  vulnerability in a system’s database with the effectiveness of the research activities.  However, under some legal frameworks, such as the Belgian one, if you have a clear privacy  statement and the data protection law is respected, establishing a CVD policy would not be  challenging. Notably, the relationship between the vulnerability owner and the researcher could  be seen as a subcontract: the ethical hacker could be seen as the processor of the personal  data in the event that personal data is found during its activities according to the GDPR aspects  of the CVD policy. If the policy is not clear enough on the privacy aspects, the researcher could  be seen as a data controller. Overall, the researcher is dealing with any sort of data and the  most important aspect is the confidentiality of the process 101.  Other legal challenges  According to some countries, if you have a traditional kind of product (running on a user’s  computer), contract law is also an impactful legal challenge. Very often, researchers must  contact cross-border vendors (usually in the United States). These products include licensing  rules stating that all the disputes concerning the product are handled according to US law.  However, United States contract law might contain provisions stipulating that all reverse  engineering is prohibited (including the type of testing employed for finding vulnerabilities).  Similarly, the DMCA could lead to legal liabilities and risks for the researcher. Researchers  101 According to some experts, this idea should be further evaluated since the controller-processor relationship must be  bilaterally agreed and put in writing. Therefore, a policy would not be enough of a waiver for data protection law.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  67  testing products under the EU’s customer protection law have different legal obligations, and  this leaves room for interpretation and uncertainty. This is one of the reasons why CERTs  intervene in these cases and report the vulnerability on the behalf of the researcher so that the  researcher will not have to face the legal burden. Additionally, national software companies  might include in the contractual obligations with the third party purchasing their product the  prohibition to perform CVD.  Cross-border dependencies also create additional legal barriers. While in recent years there has  been a greater degree of cooperation between the Member States, this could be handled more  efficiently. Establishing contacts in different universities and private companies around EU have  been proven to be useful, but the most effective way to enhance the cooperation between the  Member States in case of cross-border dependencies would be to improve the single-point-of- contact system established with the NIS directive.  Economic challenges  As acknowledged in the Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure report by ENISA102, economic  factors play an important role in the development of vulnerability disclosure policies. While quite  often information security is regarded only as a technical issue, the underlying factors that  characterise the persistency of vulnerabilities in hardware and software are only partially related  to the nature of vulnerabilities themselves, since to a great extent come from the economic  aspects of information security and its market dynamics.  Today, many ICT products are embedded with software and hardware and can connect to  networks. Besides the very recent attention from policymakers directed towards these products,  it is important to mention that while in some sectors, such as aeronautics, manufacturers have  been ahead of regulation in considering cybersecurity in their production processes103, the  software industry has, for instance, strongly opposed assuming liability for its products over the  last 50 years, as the car industry did for the first 70 years of its existence. This approach is  generated by economic incentives that, according to some researchers, can be as detrimental  for security as bad technical design104. This approach from the software industry has its own  rationality. In a market in which network economics apply, exploiting the ‘first-mover’ advantage  requires being first to market even if the product is not perfect (‘we’ll ship it on Tuesday and get  it right by version 3.0’)105. However, it is clear that this approach values cost-effectiveness,  usability and time to market over security. Indeed, using security-by-design guidelines and  updating software rise costs increase time to market and make products less user friendly with  negative effects on the product demand. Therefore, a rational behaviour from a company  conflicts with the optimal level of security. This misalignment of incentives while in a competitive  market in general does not exist, in a market with network economics106 it is becoming the norm.  Furthermore, even if the alignment of incentives is correct, the market could fail to deliver  optimal levels of security given to information asymmetries and negative externalities.  Examining the ICT products market, market failures are generated from one side by information  asymmetries – the customer does not have a clear and neutral idea of the level of security of  102 ENISA (2018), Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure, December 2018.

(1999), Information Rules – A strategic guide to the network economy,  Harvard Business School Press, Boston MA, United States).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/economics-of-vulnerability-disclosure https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/roles-and-responsibilities-of-actors-for-digital-security_3206c421-en https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/roles-and-responsibilities-of-actors-for-digital-security_3206c421-en https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221355448_Information_Security_Economics_-_and_Beyond https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3941712_Why_Information_Security_is_Hard-An_Economic_Perspective  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  68  the product – and from the other side by negative externalities – software producers are not  accountable for the damages created by the exploitation of vulnerabilities in their products.  There is also an additional factor that needs to be considered: the changing nature of the  information security market. The information security market of today is very different from  yesterday’s market. Today, with software and hardware embedded everywhere and always  being used by almost everybody, the vulnerability surface is increasingly dramatically. At the  same time, many companies that have not traditionally had a relevant presence in the ICT  sector, such as automotive or white goods producers, are starting to develop products with  integrated software and hardware components and, therefore, need to familiarise themselves  with secure development and information security and understand how to implement  vulnerability disclosure policies – a complete new domain that requires a technical and  organisational maturity unknown to them until very recently107.  Therefore, according to ENISA (2018), ‘the changing nature of the information security market  also has consequences for the economics of vulnerability disclosure, how vulnerability  disclosure is carried out, and how actors behave in the vulnerability disclosure process’108. It will  increase vulnerability complexity and the number of vulnerabilities that will require multi-vendor  coordination. Since the vulnerability disclosure process is characterised by the action of multiple  economic agents, quite often with conflicting interests, it will become increasingly important  to use regulations or incentive mechanisms to mitigate or eliminate the aforementioned  negative market outcomes.  Incentives can take a financial or a not financial form. Monetary rewards for finders from bug  bounty programmes are the most common financial incentives. Non-financial incentives have ad  hoc characteristics that inspire a behaviour not directly connected to monetary rewards. This is  the case of finding vulnerabilities for the technical challenge it offers, for the prestige that this  action entails (some companies create a ‘hall of fame’ for security researchers that find  vulnerabilities) or for ethical or ideological reasons.  During the interviews with Member States, (as shown in 53Figure 9), several (9) suggested that  limited market incentives for security researchers to participate in coordinated vulnerability  disclosure programmes have a strong impact on the establishment of a CVD policy in the  EU.  Furthermore, vendors do not have incentives to offer secure products. Indeed, while consumers  can understand the usability and price of a product, they are unable to assess its level of  security. This can generate adverse selection: since customers are unable to distinguish more  secure products from less secure products, developers offering more secure products will not  be rewarded since customers will not be willing to pay for it.  It should also be noted that most security researchers are activists, not professionals since  professional researchers usually would rather work for private companies. This is due, among  other reasons, to the limited market incentives that are in place now in terms of (economic)  rewards that are provided to researchers, for example through bug bounty programmes.  Furthermore, most Member States (13) regard the lack of resources and skills to implement  coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy as being particularly impactful. This challenge  impacts vendors, as they might not be able to build secure products, but also makes it harder to  find the vulnerabilities as researchers are not numerous. The adoption of CVD processes can  be challenging for coordinators as well (i.e. national CERTs or national cybersecurity  107  ENISA (2018), Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure, December 2018, p. 24. Available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/economics-of-vulnerability-disclosure  108 ENISA (2018), Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure, December 2018, p. 24.

Indeed, in the case of a highly technical vulnerability found in a specific sector (e.g.  aviation sector), the national CERT might lack the required skills and capabilities. As such, the  trust of the parties in the ability of the national CERT to handle the vulnerability is undermined.  Hence, the lack of resources and skills applies to and affects all stakeholders.  On the other hand, the costs of implementation and operation have been regarded as  relatively less impactful. According to the CCB ‘setting up costs of a coordinated vulnerability  disclosure policy are more budget-friendly than having external companies perform audits. After  all, the reward for a bug bounty programme is the result of a commitment on the part of the  participant to achieve a certain result, whereas an external auditor is usually only bound by a  commitment of means. The latter must therefore be compensated for all their activities, even if  they have not found any vulnerabilities or only minor vulnerabilities at the end of their  investigation.’109  An additional economic challenge to effective vulnerability treatment is the lack of cooperation  among stakeholders. Most of the Member States interviewed (17) consider that the lack of  cooperation among stakeholders either strongly or somewhat impedes the establishment  of a CVD policy. All consulted Member States consider addressing the lack of  coordination between vulnerability owners and researchers as more challenging than  addressing the lack of coordination at the level of CSIRTs.  In this context, the most critical issue is that researchers see the vulnerabilities as more severe  than the vulnerability owner, and the timeline for disclosure set by the owners as too lax.  Additionally, challenges in the coordination exist due to the lack of preparation of the  vulnerability owners on how to handle vulnerability reports. To give an example, one Member  State mentioned that some years ago several researchers were using an open bug bounty  platform to contact vulnerability owners. However, the contacts that were on the platform were  often incorrect or the reports would end up in the spam folder of the vendors’ email inboxes.  This problem has been overcome thanks to the intermediation of the national CERT. As time  went by, indeed, researchers started to include the CERT as an email recipient when contacting  the vendors.  On the other hand, it has been argued that at the level of national CSIRTs, vulnerability  disclosure mostly stays within the perimeter of the CSIRT itself. Besides, even when a non-EU  country is involved and coordination would be needed, the level of coordination among CSIRTs  is already quite well established via communication channels for incident response.  Finally, considering the role of the government in taking action to address the grey market for  code vulnerabilities as an economic chalenge, it is interesting to notice that no consulted  Member States consider addressing the grey market as a priority. Indeed, it has been argued  that the government could outlaw the selling of vulnerabilities to foreign agencies, but it might be  very challenging to address researchers’ selling of vulnerabilities on the grey market.  Political challenges  In this Section the challenges related to the development of the vulnerability disclosure process  and the roles and dynamics of the different stakeholders will be assessed.  Top down or bottom-up approach?  One of the issues raised during the analysis of the status of play of the EU experience on CVD  policies and the interviews with Member States is the different dynamics followed in developing  CVD policies, namely a bottom-up v a top-down approach. The Netherlands consider having  109 Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (2020), Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies Part I: Good  Practices. Available at: https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  70  followed a bottom-up approach as the most important success factor for their CVD policy. The  process started with the major banks and ISPs in the country feeling the urgency to  accommodate ethical hackers in finding vulnerabilities. The country noticed that if companies,  institutions or organisations are not faithful to individuals reporting vulnerabilities, it is difficult to  force them to implement/adopt a CVD system. Hence, rather than imposing companies to  establish a CVD policy (top-down approach), it is much more fruitful to stimulate an ecosystem  in which researchers/hackers know that they are safeguarded judicially and that they are  acknowledged by society. At the same time, companies and organisations know that the rights  and duties of researchers have limits, as they are not allowed to abuse vulnerabilities for  whatever reason. Some other Member States, such as France, are instead in favour of  developing a more centralised approach.  The role of government  The Member States have been consulted concerning the role that government can/should play  to ease the establishment of a national CVD policy. As shown in Figure 11, among the  proposed actions, most of the Member States (13) consider updating imperfect  cybercrime and intellectual property frameworks to better protect security researchers,  for example through ‘safe harbours’, as the most important action governments could  carry out. Changing criminal law will be, however, only one step in the process. Indeed, a safe  harbour could be established for well-intentioned researchers accessing a system without  authorisation, but this will not cover all the different offences/violations that could occur in the  process. As such, this action should be accompanied by other actions aimed at fostering an  overall trusted environment for CVD.  More generally, all actions that government could carry out to lead by example in the  establishment of a CVD policy (i.e. adapting CVD within the government; adapting vulnerability  handling and management within the government; including vulnerability management and  handling and CVD in regulation, standards and guidance, or using them as indicators of  compliance) are regarded as essential. Governments should lead by example, especially in  economies where there are numerous vendors and a great variety in the level of acceptance of  the vulnerability reports and in the value attributed to secure products. In this context, first  convincing public entities to adopt CVD and reassuring them that the reports will be handled is  considered as important.  National non-legislative activities (e.g. supporting and enabling CVD practices and promoting  awareness-raising campaigns) have also been particularly appreciated by several Member  States (12).  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  71  Figure 9 – Role of government  The role of the private sector  Different approaches can be distinguished when a CVD policy is established at the level of  private companies or at the governmental level. Companies enjoy a degree of flexibility when  adopting a CVD policy, and they can do so irrespective of a CVD policy being adopted at the  governmental level.  For their part, companies need mainly to use existing documents and apply them in a flexible  manner to implement the necessary processes, develop a policy and publish it on the  company’s website. Establishing a policy at the governmental level entails instead fostering an  overall ecosystem in which vulnerabilities are accepted and acknowledged. As such, CVD policy  at the governmental level may introduce or enhance a third-party coordinator (e.g. CSIRT),  should foster awareness-raising activities, support the legal sector in identifying possibilities and  mitigate the legal challenges (e.g. prosecution or liability of the security researchers) with regard  to coordinated responsible disclosure.  These two processes are clearly related since establishing a policy at the governmental level  might increase the chances of private companies implementing policies at their individual level  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  72  and security researchers engaging in finding vulnerabilities. This, as mentioned above, should  not necessarily take the form of an obligation from the government to private entities but can  entail stimulating a societal environment in which security researchers are safeguarded judicially  and are acknowledged by society.  This being said, when it comes to the role of the private sector in developing vulnerability  disclosure policies, there are different views among the Member States. As illustrated the  Figure 12, consulted Member States are divided on whether the private sector or the  government should lead the process or not.  Figure 10 – Role of the private sector  According to some Member States, companies should not wait for a government  legislative/policy intervention, especially because establishing a CVD policy at the company  level is already possible within some of the existing national legal frameworks. Therefore, the  private sector could take the lead in implementing coordinated vulnerability disclosure by  defining and publishing on the companies’ website public reporting mechanisms on  vulnerabilities disclosure according to the ISO standards and best practices. Furthermore, some  Member States mentioned that one of the most important aspects for the private sector to take  the lead in is the establishment of bug bounty programmes, as they help in fighting the  vulnerability taboo.  Besides, according to a consulted Member State, in many cases researchers have found that  the private sector is more appropriately positioned for dealing with vulnerability disclosure rather  than state-sector entities. Indeed, in some cases state entities have limited resources and  capabilities to deal with CVD, especially because the resources allocated for national security  can be scarce. On the other hand, there are large companies that have well-established policies  and disclose them publicly. In this context, it should be noted that CVD should be considered  necessary only insofar there is insufficient trust between the finder and the industry. As such,  direct disclosure should be promoted.  Moreover, irrespective of a CVD policy being established at the national level, companies will  still have to carry out their verification of the data the researcher has provided them with. In this  context, the role of the coordinator can be questioned. If the role of the CERT in the CVD  process is intended only as a facilitator of the communication between the parties, it could be  beneficial. However, in a CVD process, CERTs can also be empowered with the verification of  the information, and there might be cases in which CERTs are badly equipped to carry out  these activities, further undermining the trust in the process. This is usually the case with highly  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  73  technical vulnerabilities in specialised sectors. As such, mandating national CERTs to undertake  a coordinator role in the CVD process might not be the most appropriate way to go for all  Member States. In some cases, CERTs will be not equipped with adequate resources, nor  would they have the required links with the industries and the researchers’ community. In this  context, the EU should promote industries to take the lead and disclose their vulnerability  management policies along with promoting direct disclosure.  Notably, the process for the establishment of a CVD policy in the Netherlands has been  initiated by the private sector, specifically by banks and ISPs. These companies led by example  and started establishing CVD policies. This allowed for the creation of an ecosystem in the  country in which there is a societal awareness of the usefulness of the CVD process.  In other countries, the private sector also seems willing to take the lead in the CVD process. For  example, Belgium mentioned that while the private sector must increase its overall level of  maturity, the Cybersecurity Coalition110 is considering implementing its cybersecurity policy, and  leads by example. Similarly, in Finland, some vendors such as ICASI are already taking the  lead in establishing CVD policies and industry consortiums, and trying to deal with CVD and  play a role in the development of standards. Notably, Finland considers thatinitiatives at the  level of industry consortium can have a greater impact than initiatives at the company level.  On the other hand, several Member States believe that the example should be given by  the government. Among the arguments that have been provided, the Member States  mentioned that the private sector is constrained by economic considerations. Hence, the  example should be given by the government which can foster a favourable ecosystem for IT  security. The private sector should participate in the discussions with governments and  understand that the final goal of the government is not to regulate private entities but to create a  more secure ecosystem. This can also be fostered by creating communication groups with  representatives of vendors, or communication groups with sector-specific stakeholders.  Establishing safe and reliable communication channels could indeed allow more information  concerning vulnerabilities to be shared between parties.  Besides, in some cases, the capabilities of the private sector are too limited (especially for  SMEs). Implementing a CVD policy without a well-established security researcher network and  a government coordination network could be risky as the companies would not have the  resources and skills to handle the inflow of information, the patching and the disclosure.  Furthermore, if the government takes the lead in the establishment of a national CVD policy,  greater harmonisation of the processes can be assured. As such, having a patchwork of  different incoherent policies can be avoided.  Finally, for some of the smaller countries, the private sector is not expected to take the lead  given the size of the internal market.  In most of these countries’ views, the private sector is in a leading position in establishing bug  bounty programmes. The private sector can also help to develop standards and codes of  conduct defining the practical aspects of a CVD policy. Following a harmonised approach  towards CVD among private organisations also allows benefits to be disseminated more  effectively and market imbalances to be reduced.  110 Partnership between players from the academic world, the public authorities and the private sector with currently more  than 100 key players from across these three sectors as active members  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  74  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  According to CEPS (2018), in May 2018 only two countries had CVD policies in place: the  Netherlands and France. Section 2 of this report shows that there are two other countries that  have recently implemented CVD policies (Belgium and Lithuania), four additional countries are  close to releasing their policies and there are ten other countries where this process is in  progress. These data show that, although the situation on CVD policies in the EU is still  fragmented, the awareness of the need to develop them is growing and that, amid a lack of  legal certainty for security researchers, some countries are still using the current legal  framework or are amending national criminal laws to promote CVD policies in the EU.  In this Section, the challenges previously mentioned will be addressed focusing on the current  best practices in the EU.  4.1 RECOMMENDATIONS ON LEGAL CHALLENGES  It has been mentioned that legal risks faced by security researchers represent a major obstacle  to the development of vulnerability disclosure policies. However, the current practices among  Member States can suggest a modular approach to overcome these challenges.  First, as suggested by the CVD policy implemented by Belgium, since according to the  Budapest Convention only unauthorised access is unlawful, EU countries could implement  CVD policies that will offer a limited liability waiver to security researchers if they comply  with ad hoc requirements such as those of the CVD policy described in the Belgian or also in  the Dutch model of disclosure. According to the CCB, Belgium is a civil-law country and all the  countries that have signed the Budapest Convention could follow their example. A boost in this  direction could be offered by the adoption and transposition of the NIS2 directive, which requires  Member States to design cybersecurity strategies that include ‘policies to promote and facilitate  coordinated vulnerability disclosure …’ 111. Furthermore, according to some Member States  such as the Netherlands, Hungary, Denmark, Germany and Austria, the interpretation of the  intentions of the researchers by the prosecutor should adequately guarantee a level of legal  protection for the researchers.  Second, if national criminal laws put ad hoc limitations on the possibility of offering a liability  waiver to security researchers, Member States could amend their criminal laws to create the  legal certainty and the necessary ‘safe harbour’ for researchers involved in vulnerability  discovery, also recognising ethical hacking. Countries like Lithuania have recently amended  their penal code, countries like Portugal, Greece, Slovenia and Spain are in the process of  doing so.  Third, the EU could amend the cybercrime directive to offer legal certainty to security  researchers involved in vulnerability discovery and to allow for the definition of common rules  and procedures across Member States to allow for a common process of software coordinated  vulnerability disclosure in Europe. Article 3 of the directive could be amended so that Member  States consider the specific case of well-intentioned security researchers in their national  legislation. Such minimal harmonisation could offer security researchers increased protection,  particularly in cross-border situations112.  111 European Commission (2020), NIS2 proposal, p. 35.

This directive applies to reporting persons working in the private or public  sector who acquired information through breaches of EU law in a work-related context. This  directive only protects internal researchers and not external ethical hackers. It is applied to  breaches of the NIS directive or the GDPR and not to all vulnerabilities on an IT system.  However, a general EU approach on this could be limited by the principle of subsidiarity.  An additional action could be for Member States to define the role of ethical hackers.  According to some consulted Member States, an aspect that should be defined before the  establishment of any legal protection for the security researchers is how to distinguish/identify  ‘ethical hackers’ from ‘black hats’ (i.e. researchers aiming at finding vulnerabilities for an illicit  use or bad intentions). In this context, a law could be drafted defining the criteria according to  which a researcher could be considered a professional ethical hacker  (education/publications/experiences, etc.). For instance, the NIS directive transposition in the  Hungarian information security law defines who could be responsible for information security, as  well as what education a security professional must have. This definition might be a useful  example of possible criteria that can be envisaged for establishing a shared definition of ethical  hackers.  Moreover, there is the need to align the EU approach to coordinated vulnerability  disclosure with the existing EU regimes and regulations such as the intellectual property  regime and the GDPR, thus ensuring the protection of intellectual property rights or the  protection of data of stakeholders involved in vulnerability management processes.  Nevertheless, it is recommended to also be mindful about the limitations and blind spots of the  existing frameworks.  Finally, the development of CVD policies could also play an important role in the implementation  of various regulations such as the NIS2 directive and the GDPR. As mentioned previously, the  NIS2 directive proposal mentions in Article 6 the need for Member States to design  cybersecurity strategies that promote the development of CVD policies. Many Members States  mentioned during the interviews the catalyst role that the transposition of the NIS2 directive  could have for the development of CVD policies in the EU and in particular for the impetus that  could provide for amending the national criminal law, offering legal certainty to security  researchers involved in the discovery of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, according to CEPS (2018),  since the GDPR entails that software owners, vendors and tech firms become data controllers  insofar as they process personal data within their systems, if it is assumed that that  irresponsible handling of vulnerabilities could lead to personal data breaches falling within the  scope of GDPR, CVD can be an effective tool to mitigate relevant risks.  To be more precise, ‘When an unpatched vulnerability leads to the breach of personal data  under Article 33 of the GDPR, a data controller may be subject to administrative fines and  potentially other sanctions. In assessing the level of the fines, the authorities will take into  account a number of factors as stipulated in Article 83(2), including the measures taken by  controllers to avoid personal data breaches (e.g. how carefully the vulnerability was handled).  Therefore, if a controller implements a CVD allowing vulnerabilities to be dealt with in a timely  manner, then it may reduce the risk of incurring fines arising from possible personal data  breaches’ (113).  4.2 RECOMMENDATIONS ON ECONOMIC CHALLENGES  During the interviews, several Member States suggested that limited market incentives for  security researchers to participate in coordinated vulnerability disclosure programmes have a  113 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G. (2018) ‘Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe: Technology, policies and  legal challenges – Report of a CEPS Task Force’, CEPS Task Force Reports, 28 June 2018, p.55  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  76  strong impact on the establishment of a CVD policy in the EU. Therefore, appropriate  initiatives aimed at encouraging security researchers to actively participate in CVD  programmes need to be promoted by Member States, but also at the EU level – such as  the European Commission’s free and open source software auditing (FOSSA) project114.  In this context, a specific role could be played by bug bounty programmes. Bug bounty  programmes are crowdsourcing initiatives that reward security researchers for finding and  reporting vulnerabilities and represent a more proactive approach to vulnerability discovery by  companies. They operate as a marketplace intermediary between vulnerability owners and  researchers115. Bug bounty programmes can either be public or private. Public programmes  are open to everyone but may nevertheless ban some researchers from taking part based on  their track records. Private programmes are invite-only programmes for selected highly skilled  security researchers.  Many companies have created their own programmes: Microsoft, Mozilla, Kaspersky Lab and  Google run their own bug bounty programmes. In other cases, these programmes are managed  by other companies that use their own platforms and teams of experts, connecting organisations  to a global crowd of trusted security researchers to identify vulnerabilities. This is the case for  companies such as Bug Crowd, Hacker One or YesWeHack in Europe116.  Bug bounty programmes have been discussed during the interviews. Some stakeholders have  engaged in reflections on whether it would make sense for the EU to have its own bug bounty  programme in place. The general feeling is that the EU should not set up a bug bounty  programme. The risk is to face individual governments’ reluctance and requests for  justifications of such initiative, potentially seen as excessively intrusive. Interviewees have  expressed scepticism regarding the entity owning and managing the programme, and the  availability of financial resources to cover for the bounties. Indeed, organisations often  underestimate the cost of launching a bug bounty programme. In addition, some industries and  companies are currently not in favour of bug bounty programmes, as data treated in their  activities may be too sensitive to be handled by external parties, or there is too great a risk of  trade secrets being stolen. These are seen as significant obstacles to the creation of an EU bug  bounty programme. In conclusion, bug bounty programmes work well in some circumstances,  for example, for large companies who have an interest in outsourcing a part of their security  (often because external researchers are less costly than internal employees). Nevertheless, at  this stage the EU should harmonise regulation and practices across the EU Member  States on bug bounty programmes rather than attempting to set up one of their own.  However, incentives to promote CVD policies could also take the form of support to  research programmes to foster CVD policies among public and private researchers in Europe.  like the Framework Programme for Research and Technology Development and in particular  the figital Europe programme and Horizon Europe. Furthermore, the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre could also finance projects focused on enhancing coordinated vulnerability  disclosure practices in Europe.  Furthermore, since many Member States (13) regard the insufficient resources and skills to  implement coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy as being particularly impactful, it is  114 European Commission (2021), EU-FOSSA2.

When it comes to addressing the lack of coordination between vulnerability owners and  researchers, the role of a trusted third party as a coordinator to facilitate coordination  becomes particularly relevant. This role could be played by CERTs or CSIRTs or other  entities able to facilitate the coordination process. This role could be very helpful in facilitating  the relationship between researchers and vulnerability owners and in managing complex multi- party disclosure when the CVD involves more than two actors117. Furthermore, the coordination  role could be very effective in facilitating relationships among stakeholders across borders.  According to some experts, to approach cross border coordination an international not-for-profit  and well-resourced entity should be created118.  4.3 RECOMMENDATIONS ON POLITICAL CHALLENGES  This Section provides possible guidance on how to approach the political challenges related to  the development of the vulnerability disclosure process, and the roles and dynamics among the  different stakeholders will be assessed.  Top down or bottom-up approach?  One of the issues raised during the analysis of the status of play of the EU experience on CVD  policies and the interview with Member States is the different dynamics followed in developing  CVD policies, namely a bottom-up v a top-down approach. The development of decentralised or  centralised approaches has both pros and cons. For instance, countries such as France, the  United States and China, follow a top-down approach where researchers need to report  vulnerabilities through a government agency. As mentioned in some interviews with the  research community or private sector, researchers may be reluctant to share information with  government agencies in the first place. Furthermore, countries like the Netherlands consider  having followed a bottom-up approach as the most important success factor for their CVD  policy. However, while national policies reflect the different views towards vulnerability  disclosure policies, it is likely that a top-down approach in which the EU suggests a  common model of coordinated vulnerability disclosure at the EU level could work better  and promote coordination at the EU and international levels.  The role of government  Governments can play a key role in the development of CVD policies. According to the Member  States, governments should promote the following actions.  • Updating cybercrime and intellectual property frameworks to better protect security  researchers, for example through ‘safe harbours’.  • Leading by example in the establishment of a CVD policy:  o adapting CVD within the government;  o adapting vulnerability handling and management within the government;  o including vulnerability management and handling and CVD in regulation,  standards and guidance, or using them as indicators of compliance.  Governments should lead by example, especially in economies where there are numerous  vendors, a great variety in the willingness of the vulnerability owner to accept and handle the  vulnerability report and in the value attributed to secure products. In this context, first convincing  117 FIRST (2017), ‘Guidelines and practices for multi-party vulnerability coordination and disclosure’.

Furthermore, governments should also promote national non-legislative activities such as  supporting and enabling CVD practices and/or promoting awareness-raising campaigns.  Finally, governments could promote cooperation across borders and standards by facilitating  the exchange of information on vulnerabilities across borders between vulnerability owners and  security researchers, and encouraging all stakeholders to take part in the development and  enhancement of international standards on CVD policies119.  The role of the private sector  According to some Member States, companies should not wait for a government  legislative/policy intervention, especially because establishing a CVD policy at the company  level is already possible within some of the existing national legal frameworks. Therefore, the  private sector could take the lead in implementing coordinated vulnerability disclosure by  defining and publishing on the companies’ website public reporting mechanisms on  vulnerabilities disclosure according to standards and best practices, such as the ISO/IEC  29147:2018120 or the European Telecommunications Standards Institute’s guide to coordinated  vulnerability disclosure121.  The private sector could also take the lead in putting in place bug bounty programmes as they  help in fighting the vulnerability taboo.  Besides, according to a consulted Member State, in many cases, researchers have found that  the private sector is more appropriately positioned for dealing with vulnerability disclosure than  state sector entities.  4.4 RECOMMENDATIONS ON CHALLENGES FROM  OPERATIONAL AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES  Some challenges in terms of operational and crisis management activities have also been  underlined by the Member States. These challenges could be better managed with stronger  private-public partnerships (PPPs) and better information sharing among companies and  between companies and public authorities. PPPs are very helpful to start building trust among  stakeholders and, with their flexibility in terms of spectrum of mandate and type of participants,  can be very effective for sharing information on vulnerabilities. The presence of public  authorithies in the PPS can further encourage information sharing of vulnerabilities and  actionable intelligence.  4.5 THE ROLE OF ENISA AND OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMISSION  Consulted Member States have proposed several actions that ENISA and the Commission can  adopt to facilitate and support the establishment of CVD policies. Specific measures that would  ease the adoption of CVD in EU include the following.  According to several Member States (8), providing clear guidance to countries on how to  establish a CVD policy, publishing countries’ best practices and challenges, and publishing  templates upon which countries can draft their policies. Publishing best practices would be very  119 OECD (2021), ‘Encouraging Vulnerability Treatement – Overview for policy makers’, OECD Digital Economy Papers,  No 307, OECD Publishing, Paris, France, February’.

The CSIRT Network has been suggested by few countries as a very useful  forum to share best practices.  Promoting awareness-raising campaigns on CVD at the EU level to persuade vendors  across the EU to work on preparing the required interface to be able to handle the researchers’  report.  Foster cooperation and trust. Identifying and supporting initiatives meant to increase trust  between public and private stakeholders are fundamental to improving the vulnerability  management process. Establishing safe and reliable communication channels, for example,  could allow more information concerning vulnerabilities to be shared between parties.  Publishing a webpage where all the regulations in place in the different countries are collected  (a repository of Member States’ CVD initiatives) allows researchers to be more informed on the  level of protection they can receive in the different countries.  Harmonising the CVD initiatives in the different countries and promoting the use of  international standards, such as the MITRE standard for publishing vulnerabilities. Currently,  each Member State will have to establish a CVD policy upon a different national framework.  Once every country has a CVD policy in place, EU institutions can work on the harmonisation of  the different frameworks.  Encourage the establishment of bug bounty programmes at the EU level for open software  or core modules of critical infrastructures. Notably, in 2017 the EU had already established a  bug bounty programme to 15 open source software used by the European institutions, giving  awards of up to 25 000 EUR. The programme was a component of the EU-founded EU- FOSSA2122 project. The EU could built on this experience and encourage the establishment of  bug bounty programmes at the EU level.  Addressing Member States’ resource constraints that hamper the implementation of CVD  policies by fostering an ecosystem where it is economically rewarding to make secure IT  systems. This can be achieved, for example, by implementing a regulation to establish  mandatory ICT security, which could create a business case for companies to revive the ICT  market.  Including procurement rules for ICT products. Procurement policies at the EU level could be  a great market driver for vendors to produce more secure products.  Establish an easy-to-use interface for entities to report vulnerabilities, similar to the CERT/CC  web-based platform VINCE. This will encourage and enable fast vulnerability reporting and  remove potential delays from the chain of reporting.  Suggesting or mandating to Member States to define a clear separation between what  should be considered a breach of criminal law and what should not before the transposition of  122 European Commission (2021), EU-FOSSA2.

This is particularly pivotal for countries where the criminal code is more difficult to  change123.  Establishing a CVD policy at the EU level. The CERT EU or other EU bodies/agencies could  undertake the role of CVD coordinator, easing the communications between researchers and  companies involved without them having to engage with multiple national CERTs. Establishing a  CVD policy at the EU level could also help to address some fundamental questions about  liability implications (e.g. on the gathering of personal data or infringement of copyright rules).  Initiating and promoting a broader dialogue on vulnerability handling and management at  the EU level, not just on CVD. The NIS Cooperation Group could more significantly foster the  conversation on these topics. Indeed, it is not apparent that such discussions have taken place  between the Member States.  123 Italy is proposing an amendment to the NIS2 directive text, aiming at facilitating the definition of this separation. Italy is  proposing to add the following statements to Article 6 (1.a) NIS2: ‘Member States may provide for specific requirements to  make the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure mechanism consistent and compliant with their national legal frameworks. In  particular, they may define the conditions according to which the identification and disclosure of vulnerabilities would not  entail a breach of Criminal Law.’  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  81  5.

Established in 2004 and  strengthened by the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT products, services and  processes with cybersecurity certification schemes, cooperates with Member States and EU  bodies, and helps Europe prepare for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through  knowledge sharing, capacity building and awareness raising, the agency works together  with its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to boost the  resilience of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep Europe’s society and  citizens digitally secure.

BIBLIOGRAPHY 87  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  This report analyses information and presents an overview of coordinated vulnerability  disclosure (CVD) policies at the national level within the EU. Aside from offering a  comprehensive overview of the EU CVD state of play, it also provides high-level key findings  and recommendations for future improvements.  As shown by the recent Apache Log4j vulnerability, a single software flaw can put hundreds of  millions of devices around the world at risk, leaving organizations struggling to patch affected  systems before the vulnerability turns into a security incident. This is yet another vulnerability  with global repurcussions that shows the importance of security research, communication  between stakeholders, patching and good security practices.  A national CVD policy is a framework under which security researchers are allowed and  encouraged to research ICT products and services, following a set of rules, and report any  vulnerabilities they find to the national authorities or the product vendor. A national CVD policy  helps to increase the overall level of cybersecurity in a country; it increases transparency, and  this helps to build trust in the ICT services and products used in that country. In addition, it  allows for valuable time and cooperation between stakeholders for patch development, which  can potentially reduce the time for exploitation.  At the national level, the research shows that, while evolving in a fragmented EU environment,  multiple EU Member States are making progress in the development of national CVD policies.  Currently, only Belgium, France, Lithuania and the Netherlands are undertaking CVD policy  work and have implemented policy requirements. Among these four countries, policy initiatives  strongly differ. In parallel, four other Member States are on the point of implementing a policy. In  these cases, the proposal is either being examined at the level of policymakers or is being  tested in pilot projects. Another set of ten EU Member States are considering implementing a  national CVD policy or are on the point of doing so. However, failure to reach a consensus at  the political or legislative levels hampered the process. Finally, another group of Member States  (nine) has not implemented a CVD policy and the process for establishing one has not yet  started.  This EU market heterogeneity could be explained by various challenges faced by national  governments when considering CVD initiatives. These challenges include legal, economical and  political aspects which are further addressed in this report. Additionally, the lack of alignment of  CVD practices, terminology, understanding and assessment of a CVD process is perceived as  an obstacle for the implementation of national CVD policies and cooperation between Member  States.  More specifically, it turned out that the comprehensive CVD process is often, but not always,  supported by national CSIRTs, which many countries see as the natural focal point for these  activities. Good practices related to CVD policies and authorities’ involvement have been shared  by Member States representatives and collected in this report.  CVD policy initiatives carried out in China, Japan and the United States were also reported.  These non-EU players presented various methods of creating and adapting a CVD national  policy, and maintaining and working on vulnerability registries. These notions are further  detailed aside from EU practices and illustrated with inspiring inputs from experts.  Furthermore, there are several challenges that were identified by the Member States and are  presented for discussion, along with relevant recommendations that can help mitigate them and  A national CVD  policy helps to  increase the  overall level of  cybersecurity in  a country it  increases  transparency,  and this helps to  build trust in the  ICT services and  products used in  that country.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  support the implementation of national vulnerability disclosure policies. These challenges were  identified and categorized based on their nature as legal, economic or political, and include  findings such as:  • legal risks faced by researchers;  • limited economic incentives for vulnerability research;  • political challenges related to the role of the government and ‘safe harbour’ for  researchers.  Lastly, following the analysis, several recommendations and concrete suggestions were  presented for the role of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) in supporting  CVD in the EU. Some of the most important recommendations and suggested objectives are  listed below.  Major recommendations  • Take the necessary steps to develop and implement national CVD policies.  • Define the role of ethical hackers in relevant national laws to establish a framework for  ethical security research around vulnerabilities.  • Develop incentives for security researchers to actively participate in CVD research.  Role for ENISA and the European Commission  • Provide clear guidance to Member States on how to establish a CVD policy.  • Promote knowledge building and information exchange on CVD at the EU level.  • Encourage the harmonization of CVD initiatives across countries.  The information regarding the state of play of EU Member States presented herein was  collected between Q2 and Q3 2021. Any updates to that status since then will be presented in  future ENISA work.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  1. INTRODUCTION  This ENISA study primarily aims to draw a comprehensive overview of the background and  current state of play of coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) practices across the EU  Member States and outside the EU. First, the study presents a summary of the existing or  planned national CVD policy initiatives along with good practices, challenges and  recommendations on policy attempts. Second, the study offers an analysis of national, regional  and global vulnerability databases, and presents the different practices on vulnerability and  registry management along with the formats, metrics and procedures used in these databases.  National CVD policies  A national CVD policy is a framework under which security researchers are allowed and  encouraged to research ICT products and services, following a set of rules, and report any  vulnerabilities they find to the national authorities or the product vendor. A national CVD policy  helps to increase the overall level of cybersecurity in a country and increases transparency. This  helps to build trust in the ICT services and products used in that country.  Intended audience  The study is meant to be a source of information for any CVD stakeholder having an interest in  the latest thinking on this topic. The intended audience for this report can be segmented into  different CVD expert groups. These groups include policymakers and national authorities  involved in coordinated vulnerability management initiatives; national Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs); and  actors from the private sector owning an open-source or commercial database who want to  learn about current CVD developments and good practices. Lastly, vendors and researchers are  invited to treat the study as a support document in their activities.  Policy context  The current policy and legal context concerning CVD policies and vulnerability databases at the  EU and international levels are framed by key developments such as the Budapest Convention  on Cybercrime (2001), the Cybersecurity Act (2019) and the upcoming Network and Information  Security 2 (NIS2) directive, where the proposal specifically states the involvement of CSIRTs in  the national coordinated vulnerability processes. Nevertheless, further clarification and  harmonisation actions are currently being discussed.  In addition, the NIS2 directive proposal describes the development of a European vulnerability  database to support organizations and suppliers in registering, disclosing and monitoring  vulnerabilities in ICT products and services. This vulnerability database will provide all  interested parties with access to information describing the vulnerabilities; the affected products  or services; the severity of vulnerabilities and the circumstances under which they can be  exploited; and the availability of a patch or, in the absence of one, guidance regarding what  steps must be taken by system administrators or users in order to mitigate the risks.  Methodology  The data collected through desk research related to CVD policy and registries helped  contextualise findings and draw observations. Furthermore, 19 interviews were conducted with  national competent authorities and CERTs. These interviews enriched secondary research and  enabled the extrapolation of key findings with evidence-based input. An in-depth analysis and  triangulation of the data collected resulted in key findings, a detailed description of analysis  outcomes on the current CVD state of play in the EU and recommendations on planned EU  CVD initiatives.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  Structure  The report includes the following main sections.  • ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies in the EU’, which focuses on national  vulnerability management policies, including information gathered from 19 interviews  with national competent authorities and EU Member States’ CERTs.  • ‘Coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies outside the EU’, which focuses on  vulnerability disclosure policies and practices in the United States, China and Japan  • ‘CVD policy practices’, which analyses desired elements of CVD processes based on  interviews with EU Member States, good practices observed within EU Member States  and an analysis of the challenges involved in developing a national CVD Policy  • ‘Recommendations’, which provides comprehensive recommendations related to the  issues addressed, aiming to improve the current state of play within the EU.  The information regarding the state of play of EU Member States presented herein was  collected between Q2 and Q3 of 2021. Any updates to that status since then will be presented  in future ENISA work.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  10  2. COORDINATED  VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE  POLICIES  2.1 STATE OF PLAY CVD POLICIES IN THE EU AND RELEVANT  COUNTRIES AND REGIONS OUTSIDE THE EU  This Section presents an assessment of the state of play, good practices and challenges in the  establishment of CVD policies across the European Union, and in some non-European  countries, namely China, Japan, and the United States.  The findings are based on analysis and complemented with inputs from interviews shared by  representatives from the Member States that either have a CVD policy in place, are in the  process of implementing one or do not have any CVD policy in place. In particular, the  interviews covered all countries that have established a CVD policy, most countries in the  process of establishing a CVD policy or on the point of establishing one and a selection of  countries with no CVD policy in place. The representatives to be interviewed were selected in  such a way as to guarantee an adequate representation while taking into account the various  regions and countries’ sizes. This information was complemented with a detailed analysis of the  best practices and challenges, particularly legal challenges, that should be highlighted in the  context of the establishment of CVD policies across the EU.  More specifically, this overview encompasses:  • the state of play CVD policies in the EU and a number of relevant non-EU countries  and regions outside the EU;  • an overview of good practices in CVD, including a template CVD policy and procedure,  bringing together the good practices and ideas collected from the different countries;  • an overview of challenges and issues, including technical, policy, economic and legal  issues;  • possible solutions and recommendations to address these challenges and issues.  2.2 STATUS OF CVD POLICIES IN THE EU  The state of implementation of national CVD policies across the Member States shows that  substantial differences exist among them. The research shows that while evolving in a  fragmented EU environment, multiple Member States are making progress in the  development of national CVD policies but at different rates.  The Netherlands lead the EU’s efforts in establishing CVD policies. Together with the  Netherlands, France, Belgium and Lithuania are the only countries which have a fully  established national CVD policy. Some Member States (4) are on the point of implementing a  policy. In these cases, the proposal is either being examined at the level of policymakers or is  being tested in pilot projects. Several Member States (10) are in the process of implementing a  national CVD policy or are on the point of doing so. However, failure to reach a consensus at  the political or legislative levels hampered the process. Finally, another group of Member States  (9) has not implemented a CVD policy and the process for establishing one has not yet  commenced.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  11  Most of the Member States without a CVD policy in place expressed the intention of establishing  one in the future, especially in the context of the national transposition of the NIS2 directive.  Very few Member States seem to be opposed to implementing a CVD policy. In some cases,  this is because current practices or legal frameworks in place in the countries already allow  CVD processes to take place even without a formal policy. Figure 1 and Table 1 provide an  overview of the implementation of CVD policy at the national level in the EU.  Table 1 – Implementation of CVD policy at the national level in the EU  Country Status CVD policy at  the national  level  Belgium Belgium has an established CVD policy that envisages full  protection of the researcher acting in the scope of an existing  policy.  Implemented  Bulgaria Bulgaria hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy, but the national  CERT is involved in the establishment of CVD practices.  Not  implemented  Czechia Czechia does not have a CVD policy in place. The national  CERT is assessing different options for reducing  vulnerabilities, including creating a national CVD policy.  In progress  Denmark Denmark is in the initial phase of its pilot CVD project. On the point  of  implementing  Germany Germany does not have a national regulation on CVD. A CVD  policy by the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik (BSI) is about to be published. It should  be regarded as the German national policy.  On the point  of  implementing  Estonia Estonia hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy. Vulnerabilities  are handled through an array of strategies that the country has  in place.  Not  implemented  Ireland Ireland does not have a policy in place, and implementing one  is not regarded as a priority.  Not  implemented  Greece Greece hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy but takes a  positive stance on the idea of establishing one.  In progress  Spain Spain does not have a national CVD policy. A CVD framework  has been partially established at the level of the Spanish  In progress  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  12  Government National Cryptologic Center - Computer Security  Incident Response Team (CCN-CERT) and INCIBE-CERT.  France France has an established CVD policy. Art 47 (art. L 2321-4  Code de la défense) creates a safe harbour for vulnerability  reporters when certain legal criteria are met.  Implemented  Croatia Croatia hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy and there is no  plan to implement one at this stage.  Not  implemented  Italy Italy does not have a CVD policy in place. Discussions on  amendments to the criminal code might be pushed forward in  light of the NIS2 directive.  In progress  Cyprus Cyprus does not have a formal policy for CVD in place. A  policy might be established in response to the more formal  obligation stemming from the NIS2 directive.  Not  implemented  Latvia Latvia does not have a CVD policy in place, but by the end of  the year the country will put in place a formal voluntary CVD  policy for state institutions.  On the point  of  implementing  Lithuania Lithuania has a national CVD policy in place, formalised in the  amendment to the law on cybersecurity of the Republic of  Lithuania.  Implemented  Luxembourg Luxembourg has no formal CVD policy in place. A CVD policy  has been released by the national CERT and there are  ongoing discussions on a CVD policy.  In progress  Hungary Hungary hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy. There are  ongoing negotiations regarding amendments to the Hungarian  cybersecurity act ,specifically to include vulnerability  disclosure requirements.  In progress  Malta Malta hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy and there is no  plan to implement one at this stage.  Not  implemented  The  Netherlands  The Netherlands has an established CVD policy that  guarantees full protection for researchers.  Implemented  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  13  Figure 1 presents a mapping of the state of play in the implementation of CVD policies in the EU  Member States. The map divides countries based on a scale of (1) to (4), where (1) indicates  that the country has a policy in place and (4) indicates that the country has no policy in place.  The values in between indicate either that the process of implementing a policy is in progress,  or that the country is just on the point of implementing one.  From the mapping of the state of play of CVD implementation, a geographical consideration that  could be drawn is the relative greater maturity of western European countries compared to other  European regions. Conversely, southern European countries and central and eastern European  countries are lagging behind in this process.  Austria Austria does not have a CVD policy in place at this time but is  considering whether to include a CVD policy in the national  transposition of the NIS2 directive.  In progress  Poland Poland does not have a CVD policy in place. In 2017, security  breaches were partially decriminalised to improve the  protection of researchers.  Not  implemented  Portugal Portugal does not have a CVD policy in place but a task force  has been established to develop a CVD policy. The task force  presented a proposal with a comprehensive list of legislative  amendments. The proposal is now being examined by  decision-makers.  On the point  of  implementing  Romania Romania hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy and no  progress in this direction has been made.  Not  implemented  Slovenia Slovenia hasn’t yet implemented a CVD policy. The country is  planning to include a CVD policy in the next cybersecurity  strategy.  In progress  Slovakia There is no CVD policy in place, while at the legislative level  there are implicitly established processes regarding CVD.  In progress  Finland Finland has no CVD policy in place but it has begun efforts in  this direction. Besides, a CVD policy has been released by the  national CERT.  In progress  Sweden No CVD policy in place at the national level and there is no  plan to implement one at this stage.  Not  implemented  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  14  Figure 1 – Implementation of CVD policy at the national level in Europe  2.3 CVD WITHIN EACH MEMBER STATE  Belgium  Since 2018, the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (CCB) has worked in collaboration with  the Public Prosecution Service, the vulnerability reporter community, the private sector and  public authorities on the development of a national approach to CVD policies. The national CVD  policy is a formal policy explicitly included in the Belgian cybersecurity strategy (adopted by the  National Security Council and the Prime Minister’s Office) and in the CCB baseline security  guidelines (adopted by the CCB management). In 2019, the CCB adopted, as an example to  IMPLEMENTED  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  15  other organisations, a CVD policy for its website1. In December 2020, the CCB published  national guidelines to encourage all Belgian organisations to adopt a CVD policy or a bug  bounty2.  The policy promotes the adoption of coordinated vulnerability disclosure guidelines for private  and public entities and is divided into the following different documents: Guide part I – Good  practices; Guide part II – Legal aspects; an example of policy; a folder; and FAQs. The CCB is  in charge of the implementation of the national CVD policy and it provides a template of policy.  The national CVD policy attributes a role to the CCB (with its CERT team) as a CVD coordinator  by default (even when there is no CVD policy put in place by the concerned organisation). If a  vulnerability is not yet known and threatens to have a direct or indirect impact elsewhere, the  organisation responsible for identifying it must inform the CCB and the other organisations  potentially concerned, even if it does not want the vulnerability to be made public.  Without modification of the existing legal framework, those guidelines clarify the legal situation  of the researchers when the organisation has adopted a CVD policy and attributes a role to the  CCB (with its CERT team) 3 as a CVD coordinator by default (even when there is no CVD policy  in place).  In Belgium, a CVD policy or a bug bounty is considered as a type of accession agreement,  which is usually published on a website, outlining the contractual provisions between the  responsible organisation and the researchers (accepted by them when they freely decide to  participate in the policy). Subject to compliance with the mutual obligations described in the  policy, the adoption of such a policy implies an authorisation from the responsible organisation  for the researchers to access or to try to access, with good intentions, the concerned IT systems  to identify possible vulnerabilities or to provide any relevant information about the security of its  IT systems. Therefore, the access or the attempts to access those IT systems by the  researchers are lawful, as long as the pre-determined rules of the CVD are met. These rules  should ensure, among other things, the confidentiality of the information exchanged and provide  a responsible and coordinated framework for any disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities. The  term ‘disclosure’ does not necessarily mean that the vulnerability will be made public, but rather  that the participant communicates it to the responsible organisation. The participant is obliged to  communicate the vulnerability to the responsible organisation, but the public disclosure of the  vulnerability (by the participant or the organisation concerned) is optional and must be  coordinated. If a vulnerability is not yet known and threatens to have a direct or indirect impact  elsewhere, the organisation concernedmust inform the CCB and the other organisations that are  potentially involved, even if it does not want the vulnerability to be made public.  The CCB policy is presented in detail in the Annex.  There are quite a few organisations in Belgium that have a CVD or a bug bounty  policy in place: Roximus, Telenet, Voo, Base, SNCB, Brussels Airlines, Port of  Antwerp, VRT, Kinepolis, KUL, Randstad, Itsme, New pharma, Cybersecurity  coalition, Tomorrowland, Torfs and Dpg Media. Furthermore, there is an important  bug bounty platform (Intigriti) that is based in Belgium and has coordinated some of  those policies.  1 Centre for Cyber Security Belgium, ‘CCB coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy’.

CERT Bulgaria is, nonetheless, already involved in the establishment of CVD practices. CERT  Bulgaria uses an internal portal to which each of the users has access. The portal includes an  ‘installation database’, in which each user has indicated the type of software and hardware  employed. Daily information is collected from the US National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD)  on newly discovered vulnerabilities. This information is matched with the installation database  and the constituents receive an email with vulnerabilities relevant to the software and hardware  it uses. The constituents can see the same information on their profiles by entering the portal.  In fulfilment of its proactive obligations, CERT Bulgaria prepares and sends monthly bulletins. It  publishes brief statistical information on the most recent attacks and/or threats with the most  important recommendations on how to counteract them and information on the published  vulnerability bulletins of Microsoft, CISCO, Adobe and others popular vendors used by our  constituents.  In this respect, while the 2020 national cybersecurity strategy5 does not mention CVD, the  document lays down the main measures that will need to be achieved to meet the security  objectives set out in the NIS directive. Among others, the strategy put forward the ‘development  of the minimum required capacity of the individual CERT/CSIRTs’ and ‘the expansion of the  scope, capabilities and functions of the Security Operations Center (SOC)’. In addition to  incident and attack response activities, SOCs cover all aspects related to cybersecurity, such as  awareness raising, resilience, detection, disclosure, crisis reporting and management.  Czechia  While there is no CVD policy currently in place, the National Cyber and Information Security  Agency (NÚKIB) is continuously assessing ways of reducing vulnerabilities, including creating  a national CVD policy. In 2018, the governmental CERT (part of NÚKIB) mentioned CVD as a  topic that the country needs to catch up with and in the National Cyber Security Strategy of the  Czech Republic (2021), there is a reference to a ‘coordinated approach of private and public  entities in cybersecurity’. In the proposal of the Action plan for the national cyber security  strategy of the Czech Republic for the period from 2021 to 2025, there is a task to prepare a  proposal for a national CVD policy in 2021. Also, in the 25 Years of the Czech Republic’s OECD  Membership report, the country pledged to include CVD as a tool that should be adopted in  national programs and standards.  Furthermore, the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency has established close  cooperation with selected private companies to exchange information about cybersecurity  threats, trends and best practices. The National Security Agency has an agreement on the  government’s security programme with Microsoft and Cisco, under which ‘the parties can share  and exchange cybersecurity information, which means that the NSA has access to these  4 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G.

However, by no means could this  memorandum of understanding substitute establishing a CVD mechanism.  Denmark  Denmark has not yet implemented a CVD policy; however, the country is in the initial phase of  its pilot CVD project.  As part of the Danish Cyber and Information Security Strategy 2018–2021 (initiative 1.7), a draft  on a governmental CVD policy framework has been prepared. The strategy mentions that  communications concerning cyber threats are the responsibility of the Danish Centre for Cyber  Security in collaboration with the relevant sectoral authority. Communication will need to be  coordinated in the event of a major, cross-sectoral incident, under the responsibility of the  central operational communication staff (DCOK). ‘The DCOK is responsible for ensuring rapid  disclosure and coordination of relevant information to the general public, including to the  media’ 6. No further details are provided in the strategy.  Germany  Formally, Germany does not have a national regulation on CVD. The German Federal Office  for Information Security (BSI) has, nonetheless, a policy in place which will be published after  approval by BSI management and the relevant ministries. Processes related to reporting within  the federal administration to the BSI and by the BSI have been established for dealing with  vulnerabilities (cf. § 4 Paragraph 2-4 BSIG). According to this, all federal authorities must report  to the BSI any information in connection with newly identified vulnerabilities that are important  for the performance of tasks or the security of the information technology of other authorities.  All the vulnerabilities found are reported to the affected manufacturer via the BSI so that they  can act accordingly. The aim of the procedure is to minimise damages resulting from the  possible exploitation of vulnerabilities. On the one hand, the coordinated participation of  affected manufacturers enables functioning security updates to be provided. On the other hand,  the temporary retention of vulnerability and attack details reduces the potential damages.  Currently, the BSI policy should be regarded as the German national policy, as this authority is  the focal point for CVD. In this context, it is not expected for other public entities in Germany to  publish another formal CVD policy.  The Bundeswehr (German armed forces) has also published, on 21 October 2020, its  vulnerability disclosure policy 7. The policy applies to Bundeswehr IT systems and web  applications that are connected to and accessible over the internet, particularly the websites of  the Bundeswehr 8. The program affects all digitally accessible systems of the Bundeswehr, i.e.  their hospitals (Berlin, Koblenz, etc.), universities (Munich and Hamburg) and others.  This policy cannot be used to prepare or transmit vulnerability reports in third-party programs  without the consent of the Bundeswehr.

GERMANY – Bundeswehr vulnerability disclosure policy 9  The Bundeswehr published its vulnerability disclosure policy on 21 October 2020. Whenever a  vulnerability is discovered, researchers should proceed as follows.  • Before you report, find out about the cases that do not fall within the scope of our Bundeswehr  vulnerability disclosure policy and are not dealt with in this context.  • Use the contact form to get in touch with us about the security problem or send your results by  email to security@bundeswehr.org. Encrypt your documentation with our Pretty Good Privacy  (PGP) key so that this sensitive information does not fall into the wrong hands. To optimise  communication between you and the central reporting office in the Bundeswehr, we ask you to  use the format template provided.  • Do not exploit the vulnerability or problem by, for example, downloading, changing or deleting  data, or uploading code.  • Do not pass on information about the vulnerability to third parties or institutions unless this has  been approved by the Bundeswehr.  • Do not carry out any attacks on our IT systems that compromise, change or manipulate  infrastructure and people.  • Do not carry out social engineering (e.g. phishing), (distributed) denial of service, spam or  other attacks on the Bundeswehr.  • Provide us with sufficient information so that we can reproduce and analyse the problem. Also,  provide a contact option for questions.  Bundeswehr commitments include the following.  • We will try to end the vulnerability as soon as possible.  • You will receive feedback from us on the receipt of your report and on your report.  • If you follow the instructions of the Bundeswehr security policy, the law enforcement authorities  will not be informed of your connection to the findings. This does not apply if it is evident that  criminal or intelligence intentions are being pursued.  • We will treat your report confidentially and will not pass your personal data on to third parties  without your consent.  • We will inform you of the receipt of your report, as well as the validity of the vulnerability / IT  security gap and the elimination of the problem during the processing period.  • The finder is judged according to his abilities and not according to age, education, gender,  origin or social rank. That is why we show this respect publicly and recognise this  achievement. In addition, if nothing else is desired, we will describe the closed vulnerability  and the name (or alias) of the discoverer on our ‘thank you’ page, to publicly express our good  cooperation with the Bundeswehr.  9 This section draws from the vulnerability disclosure policy of the Bundeswehr (VDPBw).

Estonia  Estonia has not yet implemented a CVD policy and the Cybersecurity Strategy for 2019–2022 of  the Republic of Estonia does not elaborate on possible mechanisms for CVD 10.  However, vulnerabilities are handled through the array of strategies and institutions that the  country has in place. For example, the Department of Standards and Supervision has overseen  the development of a new standard on information security (which should be enforced in  January 2022). The supervisory authority regularly oversees public sector institutions on  standards’ implementations. Besides, the Department of Analysis and Prevention carries out  cybersecurity analysis based on the data gathered by the national CERT and conducts  prevention campaign (e.g. yearly awareness-raising campaign on cyber hygiene). Estonian  private companies and academia are active in vulnerability disclosure, but the cooperation  between these actors and the governmental agencies is not formalised.  In 2018, after the Return of Coppersmith’s Attack (ROCA) vulnerability in the eID systems was  discovered, the Estonian Information System Authority (EISA) suggested vulnerability  disclosure as a possible solution to prevent these types of incidents from happening again. In  particular, EISA mentioned that ‘anticipated sources of information – international notification  mechanisms and notification from vendors – failed Estonia this time while the information  provided by an international group of researchers allowed to address the issue’. The notification  mechanisms are designed for incidents with significant impact and thus not ideal when  addressing vulnerabilities in earlier stages of crises, as in the case of ROCA. According to EISA,  the episode could have allowed to revisit the notification mechanism, involving vulnerability  sharing to be addressed jointly 11.  Ireland  Ireland does not have a policy in place and does not consider implementing such a policy as a  priority.

However, a vulnerability disclosure policy  framework has been partially established at the level of CCN-CERT and INCIBE-CERT (i.e.,  National Institute of Cybersecurity of Spain).

According to the issued decree, the CCN-CERT will provide the public  administrations with the following services.  • Support and coordination for treating vulnerable aspects and solving security incidents  taking place in the General State Administration, regional administrations, entities  comprising local administrations and public law entities with their legal status, that are  linked to or depend on any of the preceding administrations.  • Information about vulnerable aspects, alerts and warnings of new threats to information  systems, gathered from different sources of renowned prestige, including own sources.  INCIBE-CERT is the reference security incident response centre in Spain. Art. 11.1 a) 2º and b)  of the decree-law for the NIS transposition15 establishes the role of INCIBE-CERT as the  reference CERT/CSIRT for private companies and the citizens. Among the different services  that INCIBE-CERT provides to these subjects, there is the coordination of vulnerabilities.  Art. 11.2 of the decree-law establishes that the CERTs/CSIRTs will coordinate with each other  and with the rest of the national and international CSIRTs in responding to incidents and  managing security risks. The security risks include the managing and coordination of  vulnerabilities. INCIBE-CERT provides support to those who want to provide information on  vulnerabilities detected in either INCIBE-CERT or third-party systems, for private companies  and citizens.

SPAIN – INCIBE-CERT CVD policy17  INCIBE-CERT sets out the actions that are not allowed in the search for  vulnerabilities.  • Using social engineering.  • Compromising the system and persistently maintaining access to it.  • Changing the data accessed by exploiting the vulnerability.  • Using malware.  • Using the vulnerability in any way beyond proving its existence. To demonstrate that the  vulnerability exists, the reporter could use non-intrusive methods. For example, listing a  system directory.  • Using brute force to gain access to systems.  • Sharing vulnerability with third parties.  • Performing DoS or DDoS attacks.  The INCIBE-CERT also sets out the steps that should be followed to report a  vulnerability, i.e. send the (ideally) encrypted information to incidencias@incibe- cert.es  The following information is required to report a vulnerability.  • A clear and detailed description of the vulnerability.  • Clear and detailed information on how the vulnerability was discovered. The objective is to be  able to reproduce it.  • Other information that may be useful when reporting the vulnerability, such as proof of the  existence of the vulnerability (screenshot, link, etc.); timeline or some information about the  moment the vulnerability was discovered; any type of information deemed necessary to  locating and resolving the vulnerability in the fastest and most efficient way possible.  Once the notification is received, INCIBE-CERT will confirm receipt and begin  communication with the interested party. If the vulnerability involves a Critical  Infrastructure Operator, INCIBE-CERT also has different contact points to  facilitate communication and ensure the notification has been correctly received.  In addition, its specialised technical team offers support to mitigate and resolve  the vulnerability as soon as possible. Once the vulnerability is communicated,  periodic follow-ups are carried out until the standard term set by the INCIBE- CERT. Whether the management of the vulnerability is successful, or if the actor  responsible for managing the vulnerability has not taken sufficient measures to  remedy it within 60 days, INCIBE-CERT will issue a notice publishing the  vulnerability together with the reporter if he wants. Researchers are not  16 CVE numbering authorities (CNAs) are organisations from around the world that are authorised to  assign CVE IDs to vulnerabilities affecting products within their distinct, agreed-upon scope, for inclusion in  first-time public announcements of new vulnerabilities.

Nonetheless, if the person reporting  the vulnerability desires, it will offer its communication channels as a promotion  for the disclosure.  France  France has established a CVD policy in 2016. If a researcher reports a suspected vulnerability  to theAgence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI)18, Art. 47 of the Law  for a Digital Republic supersedes Art. 4019. Art. 47 exempts the researcher (‘goodwill person’)  who reports the vulnerability from the provisions contained in Art. 40. The agency must also  protect the confidentiality of the identity of the researcher who reports the vulnerability20.  Art. 47 (art. L 2321-4 Code de la défense) creates a safe harbour for vulnerability reporters  when two legal criteria are strictly met, constituting a statutory derogation to French criminal law  (Art. 40 Code de procédure pénale).  1. Researchers reporting a vulnerability must act in good faith i.e., either knowing that  they act within the boundaries of the legal framework, or that they reasonably ignore  that they are acting outside of the legally authorised scope.  2. Vulnerabilities must be reported to ANSSI exclusively – no other public institution can  receive a vulnerability notification and meet Art. 47’s legal criteria to create a safe  harbour.  When those two criteria are strictly met, the following applies.  1. Vulnerability discovery will not be prosecuted even if it should normally amount to a  crime.  2. ANSSI can protect the vulnerability’s owner identity and anonymise the vulnerability  report and any information relating to the vulnerability’s discovery.  ANSSI oversees the implementation of the law and provides guidance and procedures allowing  researchers to benefit from the safe harbour. Besides, ANSSI contribute to the registration of  vulnerabilities to MITRE when coordinating vulnerability disclosures with both researchers and  vendors. CERT FR provides a list of security alerts, including vulnerability information, however,  vulnerability reporting is limited to a set of organisations operating in France and having incident  response teams.  Notably, a comprehensive CVD policy inspired by current state-of-the-art recommendations  (ISO norms, etc.) is currently under review by ANSSI.

The latest National Cyber Security Strategy of the Republic of Croatia is from 2015 and  does not mention responsible disclosure or CVD21.  Italy  Currently, Italy does not have a CVD policy in place. The Department for the Digital  Transformation within the Presidency of the Council of Ministries in 2018 (named Digital  Transformation Team at that time) drafted a CVD policy that aimed to be general and potentially  able to cover both the private and public sectors. The work has been carried out in collaboration  with the national CERT. A pilot programme aimed at supporting private companies in  implementing CVD policies and improving internal/external processes has been prepared, but  since then no progress has been made due to the lack of legal certainty regarding the protection  of researchers.  Within the discussion around the NIS2 directive, the discussion on CVD picked up and some  players that were against changing the legal code seem now to be more inclined towards  introducing a CVD policy. Italy is proposing an amendment to the text of NIS2 directive aiming  at facilitating the establishment of a CVD policy within Member States, by the time the NIS2 will  be received for the national transposition. The proposed amendment to the NIS2 text states that  the Member States should define the conditions according to which the identification and  disclosure of vulnerabilities would not entail a breach of criminal law. According to Italy, leaving  the discretion to the judges in deciding what constitutes unauthorised access to a system would  be alarming as every judge would have the freedom to establish, according to his parameters,  what should be considered ethical hacking and what should not  Many private companies, such as the TIM Group (formerly Telecom Italia Mobile), have CVD  policies in place and published on their website. However, according to the current penal code  in Italy, these companies would still be able to sue the security researchers.  Cyprus  Cyprus does not have a formal policy for CVD in place, although a policy might be established  in response to the more formal obligation stemming from the NIS2. The country has  consolidated the national CSIRT through the development of appropriate procedures and  information exchange interfaces for the effective response to and management of incidents.  Incident response mechanisms have been identified and codified in relevant secondary  legislation, but no CVD is envisaged22. The Cyber Security Strategy of the Republic of Cyprus  2020 mentions that ‘in addition to exchanging information regarding threats and cyber incidents,  information exchange about systems’ vulnerabilities should also be promoted, offered by the  Cypriot market, in coordination with companies and customers vulnerability disclosure’23.  21 Republic of Croatia Ministers of Interior (2015), ‘The National Cyber Security Strategy of the Republic of Croatia’ (Official  Gazette No 108/2015).

The handling and management processes  will instead be implemented by the national CSIRT.  Latvia  Latvia does not have yet a CVD policy in place, but the country is in a transition phase. Indeed,  by the end of the year, Latvia will put in place a formal policy encouraging state institutions to  implement a CVD policy. This will provide state institutions with a policy template and will  designate responsible entities that will be in charge of the implementation of the policy. For now,  there are some institutions and organisations that have voluntary CVD published. CERT Latvia  has led by example with the publication of its vulnerability disclosure policy.  Initially, the policy will be voluntary and CERT.LV will provide support during the implementation  and act as a coordinator among the involved parties in the CVD process. After the report is  published, the implementation steps will continue in close cooperation between the Ministry of  Defence (MoD) and CERT.LV.  Besides, the latest Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia (2019) envisages the definition of a CVD  policy. ‘Following the principles described in National Defence Concept,’ the strategy reads, ‘it is  necessary to develop regulations on responsible security vulnerability disclosure, which are  important for ICT security, addressing of gaps and vulnerabilities and encouraging system  designers and operators be more responsible (Activity 2.1)’24.  Already since 2016 Latvia has been taking steps towards the definition of a CVD policy. In 2016  the MoD proposed to address the responsible disclosure policy (RDP) / CVD process via  legislation. In particular, the proposal intended to specify the responsible disclosure process in  the law on IT security. This proposal attempted to address the lack of a framework establishing  the steps to take after a vulnerability was discovered by a researcher, and the lack of protection  for researchers. A multi-stakeholder working group was established to discuss the best  approach to include RDP in the law. Legal experts, security researchers, cyber policy experts,  CERT.LV and several other groups and institutions were represented in this working group.  Unfortunately, the proposal failed to convince all involved parties and was not accepted.  Retrospectively, according to representatives from the MoD of the Republic of Latvia, it can be  admitted that the proposal was cumbersome. This is also one of the reasons why the policy  framework that is currently being proposed is voluntary.  Some organisations in Latvia have published their CVD policies, for instance, in the  banking sector JSC Swedbank (as early as 2015) and JSC SEB Banka. CERT.LV  has led by example with the publication of its vulnerability disclosure policy.  LATVIA – CERT.LV responsible disclosure policy 25  We support responsible security vulnerability disclosure policy and principles and welcome any  security researchers to report security flaws in the CERT.LV services and resources (cert.lv  domain).

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in the CERT.LV services,  please contact us at cert@cert.lv and include the following information:  • a detailed description of the vulnerability;  • detailed information about the exploitation of the vulnerability;  • if applicable, a link, screenshot or any other information that could help to identify the  vulnerability you have found.  We prefer that you use CERT.LV PGP key (https://cert.lv/en/contacts) to protect the information you  are sending. We will keep you updated while we solve the issue and inform you when the  vulnerability is fixed.  What do we expect from you? It is important that you follow good practices.  • You should not use the vulnerability to access or attempt to access information that does not  belong to you (only to prove the existence of the vulnerability).  • You should not use the vulnerability to remove or modify the information.  • You should not affect the availability of our services through denial of service (DoS) attacks.  • You should not make any social engineering attacks.  • We would appreciate you letting us fix the reported vulnerability before going public with it.  What does CERT.LV offer?  • We do not offer monetary compensation, but when the issue is solved CERT.LV can help to  prepare information for publication and promote the researcher’s contribution if that is mutually  agreed upon.  If you found a vulnerability in other institutions’ services, please contact us at cert@cert.lv (please  use CERT.LV public PGP key: https://cert.lv/en/contacts).  Lithuania  Lithuania has a national CVD policy in place which has been adopted through the Republic of  Lithuania Law on Cyber Security and its amendments regarding CVD policy formalisation. The  law entered into force on 28 June 2021. All ministries were involved in the approval of the law.  For example, the Ministry of Justice, Prosecutor General’s Office and Police department  provided indications on the conditionalities for the researchers’ activities to be established. They  asked in particular to set not only the right to search for vulnerabilities but also to set an  obligation to notify the relevant organisation about the search being performed. Concerning the  implementation of the law, the MoD designated the National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC –  national CERT) as coordinator.  It is important to note that the CVD policy in Lithuania does not apply to vendors but only to  cybersecurity entities (CSEs) that are the owners of assets that the vulnerabilities are being  found on. The NCSC does contact the vendor though, in case a vulnerability is found in a  product that might be used by other parties (and the essence of the vulnerability is not a  misconfiguration or a vulnerability that is already known). Nevertheless, the NCSC has no right  to oblige the vendor to take any action if the vendor is not a CSE.  IMPLEMENTED  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  26  Voluntary vulnerability disclosure mechanisms were already applied by organisations in  Lithuania (e.g. JSC Ignitis group or the Vilnius municipality administration). According to a report  facilitated by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Center (GCSCC), a (voluntary) vulnerability  disclosure framework was already in place in 2017, based on which ‘organisations have  established their processes and mechanisms to receive, disseminate and share information on  vulnerabilities’26.  Furthermore, the Order on the approval of the rules on the insurance of security and integrity of  public communications networks and public electronic communications services already  required that ‘providers of public communications networks report certain types of security  incidents’. In this context, different CSIRTs in the country, such as CERT-LT, were provided with  ‘mechanisms in place to share information including specific timeframes’27.  Nonetheless, there was no vulnerability disclosure practice applied on a national level, which is  why ordinary citizens or ‘white hackers’ had limited opportunities to share or report such  vulnerabilities found in other information systems, especially from a legal point of view.  As such, in 2020, the Ministry of National Defence started drafting an amendment to the  Republic of Lithuania Law on Cyber Security (hereinafter ‘the amendment’). The amendment  determines the following restrictions, that apply to a search of vulnerabilities, and that define  what makes it legitimate.  1. The operation, functionality, services and data availability or integrity of the communication and  information system may not be disrupted or altered.  2. When a vulnerability is identified, the search activity is terminated.  3. Within 24 hours of the start of the search activity, information on search results must be submitted  to the NCSC under the Ministry of National Defence or CSE.  4. It is not unnecessarily sought to validate, monitor, record, intercept, acquire, store, disclose, copy,  modify, corrupt, delete, destroy data managed by a cybersecurity entity.  5. No attempts are made to guess passwords. Passwords obtained illegally are not used and  employees of the CSE or other persons who have the right to use non-public information relevant  to the search for loopholes are not exploited or manipulated in order to obtain the information.  6. Information about the detected vulnerability is shared only with the NCSC under the Ministry of  National Defence or CSE and made public according to the amendment.  Only if all those requirements are met would the search for vulnerabilities be  regarded as lawful. Failure to comply with at least one of those requirements would  lead to an application of criminal liability.  Luxembourg  For now, Luxembourg has no formal CVD policy in place. The National Cybersecurity  Strategy IV, covering 2021 to 2024, states under Strategic Objective I: Building trust in the  digital world and protecting human rights online – I.5 Pen-testing, bug bounties and responsible  disclosure of vulnerabilities that ‘the government will propose the necessary legislative changes  and initiatives to make possible or deepen different approaches in order to improve  cybersecurity by using the collective intelligence of security researchers, private companies  26 Global Cyber Security Capacity Center (GCSCC) (2017), Cybersecurity Capacity Review – Republic of Lithuania,  August.

The  possibility of creating, in the near future, a platform at GOVCERT.LU that encourages  researchers to report bugs, especially those associated with vulnerabilities, will be analysed’.  The strategy defines the strategic objectives that should be achieved in the next 4 years and will  be complemented by an action plan outlining concrete measures to be implemented following a  definite time frame, and the actors called on to contribute to their implementation. The High  Commission for National Protection will provide the action plan to interested parties upon  request.  Besides, the national CERTs have been charged with the operational objective to monitor  threats and vulnerabilities and to make the results available to all Luxembourg actors 28. The  Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL), in its role as CERT for the  Luxembourg economy and municipalities, sets out the procedure for vulnerability disclosure for  its constituency 29, receives reports about new vulnerabilities in software and hardware products  or discovers them.  In the context of the public sector, i.e. governmental and institutional actors and critical  infrastructures, designated according to national legislation, Luxembourg’s governmental  CERT (GOVCERT) launched in 2019 a hall of fame30 and implemented an informal policy on  disclosure31 in alignment with the National Cybersecurity Strategy III 32. However, in  GOVCERT’s experience, the hall of fame has not provided sufficient incentives to encourage  widespread reporting. Indeed, since the service is online, only a few vulnerability reporters  reached out and even fewer vulnerabilities have officially been brought to the attention of  GOVCERT.  LUXEMBOURG – CIRCL step for responsible vulnerability disclosure33  The Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL), in its role as CERT for the  Luxembourg economy and municipalities, sets out the procedure for vulnerability disclosure for its  constituency, receives reports about new vulnerabilities in software and hardware products or  discovers them. CIRCL can receive vulnerability notifications from named or anonymous reporters.  In some cases, CIRCL discovers the vulnerability within the frame of a specific incident analysis or  report. Notifications can only be received by the standard report process of CIRCL. The use of  PGP34 is recommended while exchanging information about the vulnerability. CIRCL expects from a  clear statement from the reporters on whether they want to remain anonymous. By default, the  reporters will be mentioned to the software or hardware vendor.  CIRCL expects from reporters a reasonable effort to ensure that the report is complete and includes  enough information for the vendor to evaluate the vulnerability report.

This notification is considered the initial notification. The default delay  for the vendor to resolve the vulnerability is 30 days, starting from the initial notification. If the vendor  cannot fulfil within 30 days, the vendor must provide to CIRCL an explanation why he cannot correct  the vulnerability within that time frame. Under such a condition, an additional grace period can be  requested. CIRCL and/or the reporter will review the explanation and CIRCL will find an agreement  with the vendor if possible. A request for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) assignment  is done at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) by CIRCL if the vendors are  not known to have an existing CVE assignment procedure.  Publication by the vendor  If the grace period is over, the vendor publishes the vulnerability, along with patches or updates to  correct the vulnerability. The publication can be done via the official public vendor channels or  security channels.  Publication by CIRL or/and the reporter  If the grace period is over and the vendor does not provide an acceptable answer, CIRCL and/or the  reporter will publish the information of the vulnerability.  Hungary  Currently, in Hungary there is no CVD policy in place. Last year, the National Cyber Security  Centre of Hungary (NCSC HU) has suggested initiating a process for establishing a CVD policy,  but the proposal faced opposition from the government.  At the moment, there are ongoing negotiations about amending Act L of 2013 on electronic  information security of state and local government bodies (Hungarian cybersecurity act) to  include vulnerability disclosure requirements for institutions falling within the scope of the act 35.  Currently, system owners are obliged to undertake vulnerability scanning on their systems and  to manage the mitigation process, along with maintaining a database about their vulnerabilities.  Automatic black-box vulnerability scan systems36 help these system owners in the process. The  system owners are mandated to share the relevant information with the CSIRT only if an  incident occurs. The National Cyber Security Center of Hungary is also publishing a  recommendation about vulnerability disclosure requirements.  Besides, due to COVID-19, the NCSC HU developed a vulnerability scan process on healthcare  applications. The NCSC HU is operating this process by connecting the medical institutions and  the application developers and by ensuring cooperation between the parties in the mitigation  process. Public disclosure is not part of the NCSC HU coordination process, and it depends on  the willingness of the developers.  Notably, together with the Netherlands and Romania, Hungary launched the Global Forum on  Cyber Expertise (GFCE) initiative for CVD. The objective of the initiative, launched in 2016,  35 Act on the Electronic Information Security of Central and Local Government Agencies (Act L of 2013/Information Security  Act) (2013).

Participants to the initiative have undersigned the CVD manifesto, committing to implement  public reporting mechanisms on vulnerabilities in their ICT systems and calling upon other  organisations to do the same. The manifesto aims to make all parties more aware of the  importance of cooperation to improve cybersecurity. Furthermore, the program aims at  developing a draft memorandum on CVD, at promoting the importance of CVD during  conferences and high-level meetings and at strengthening a CVD network38.  The initiative in the GFCE laid the groundwork for a joint project of four participating States  (Czechia, Hungary, the Netherlands and Romania) aiming at operationalising the relevant  confidence-building measure of the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) at  a regional level. The project encourages responsible reporting of vulnerabilities affecting the  security of / in the use of ICTs on a voluntary basis.  Malta  Malta has not yet implemented a CVD policy. The Malta Cyber Security Strategy 2016 mentions  that ‘the possibility of a national responsible disclosure policy framework may also be explored.  The framework would need to establish the right parameters and conditions to ensure its  effectiveness’. According to the report, the framework could be enabled through ‘self-regulation,  promotion and encouragement by the government, as well as through a proper framework to  ensure responsible vulnerability disclosure’.  The Netherlands  The Netherlands has had a CVD policy in place since 2013. The Netherlands has led the EU’s  efforts in establishing CVD policies and heavily contributed to supporting other Member States  in their efforts to address their own challenges and concerns. It is a formal policy although there  is no reference to CVD in Dutch law. The closest to an official policy is the beleidsbrief OM,  loosely translated, the ‘policy letter of the public prosecutor on CVD’. The public prosecutor  plays an autonomous role and has the discretion to decide when to prosecute. In this context,  historical judicial cases have established the boundaries within which a security researcher can  operate.  Since 2013 the National Cyber Security Centre of the Netherlands (NCSC NL) has received  and processed hundreds of reports39. Many organisations in the country have actively adopted  CVD and have been satisfied with the results. Even though there are vulnerability reports of  minor or theoretical issues, there are some important reports that would not have been found  otherwise and could, if abused, have had major adverse effects on the security of the  infrastructure or customer data.  37 Cybil, ‘Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (GFCE Initiative)’.

Austria  Austria does not have a CVD policy in place at this time. CERT.AT provide on their website a  section for incident reporting, both in the context of obligatory/voluntary reporting according to  NIS law, and in the context of spontaneous reporting, while no section is dedicated to laying  down a CVD mechanism.  During the NIS1 transposition process, establishing a CVD policy was regarded as unnecessary  given that the national law already allowed for disclosure. Currently, Austria is considering  whether to include a CVD policy in the national transposition of the NIS2 directive. According to  the national CERT, there is a spectrum of vulnerabilities based on the type of data that are dealt  with. For some vulnerabilities (e.g. those including personally identifiable data)40 there might be  the need for a CVD legal baseline, whereas with the majority of discovered vulnerabilities the  national law would be sufficient. It also depends on whether the vulnerability is in common off- the-shelf software, bespoke software or reachable services on the Internet.  Some private companies are fostering the sharing of vulnerabilities according to established  best practices. For example, A1 Telekom Austria runs a bug bounty program. Everyone is  eligible to participate in the program, subject to the conditions and requirements of A1 Telekom  Austria41.

AUSTRIA – Borealis vulnerability disclosure policy (42)  Borealis, an Austria-based international provider of advanced and circular  polyolefin solutions, published on this website a guide for researchers on how to  disclose vulnerabilities. The policy sets out steps and requirements for users,  researchers and the company itself. Borealis is requiring that all users:  • make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to  production systems and destruction of data during security testing;  • perform research only within the scope set out below;  • use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to Borealis;  • keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between the user and  Borealis for 90 days while it is used by Borealis to resolve the issue.  The steps for a responsible disclosure are:  • send your findings to infosecurity@borealisgroup.com and encrypt them to prevent this critical  information from falling into the wrong hands;  • do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example by  downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or  modifying other people’s data;  40 The PI system collects, stores and manages data from your plant or process. You connect your data sources to one or  more PI interface nodes. The interface nodes get the data from your data sources and send it to the PI Server.  41 Open Bug Bounty (2021).

Error! Bookmark not defined.  Poland  Currently, there is no consistent policy for managing security vulnerabilities such as CVD in  Poland. The 2018 cybersecurity strategy refers to the possibility for relevant CSIRTs to publish  information on significant incidents, when it is necessary to prevent an incident from occurring,  or when, for other reasons, disclosure of the incident is in the public interest43.  The issue of reporting vulnerabilities has been partially covered by the National Cybersecurity  System Act. In addition, in 2017, security breaches were partially decriminalised to improve  researchers’ protection (Articles 269b and 269c of the penal code)44.  The CSIRT NASK (Research and Academic Computer Network) team receives reports of  vulnerabilities regularly and finds them as part of software security research. CSIRT NASK  approaches each case individually and does not strictly follow the Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure process proposed by CERT/CC45. Sometimes, the centre cooperates with foreign  institutions that can help in contacting software or devices’ vendors.

However, a task force including the Portuguese  National Cybersecurity Centre (CNCS), public authorities and stakeholders from the  cybersecurity community was convened to work on a proposal for establishing a policy at the  national level which anticiptes the need to amend the criminal law. The task force presented a  proposal with a comprehensive CVD policy and legislative amendments. The proposal is now  being examined by decisionmakers.  In 2020, the CNCS also developed a National Cybersecurity Framework setting out a relatively  long list of security measures and standards that organisations can use to perform a risk-based  approach to tackle cyber threats. This framework includes information on setting processes to  receive, analyse and respond to vulnerabilities disclosed from internal and external sources46.  This allows willing organisations to implement their own process to receive, analyse and verify  the submission of vulnerabilities. In terms of process implementation, the document states that  organisations should do the following.  • ‘Make available a process to report vulnerabilities, both internally and externally’.  • ‘Provide a process to receive security alerts, recommendations, bulletins from vendors  and suppliers, interest groups and others’.  • ‘Consistently evaluate, treat and respond to each submission’.  The pieces of evidence that should be provided (by the organisation) are the following.  • ‘Support document for vulnerability management process’.  • ‘Records from past subscription to technical interest groups’.  • ‘Records of receiving and treating reported vulnerabilities’47.  Notably, it is in the view of the CNCS that each vendor should put in place its CVD policy and  establish its own rules. The planned role of the national CERT would be to oversee the  communication between the parties and check if the whole process is carried out consistently  with the national guidelines. The CERT would, therefore, act as the mediator.  Finally, the National Cybersecurity Centre and the DNS.PT Association (referred to as ‘.PT’)  jointly launched Webcheck.pt48, an initiative to promote the adoption of good practices and  standards contributing to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of the internet. As promoters  areresponsible for the maintenance of the Webcheck.pt platform, .PT and CNCS allow the  interested communities to perform security tests and disclose results under the terms and  conditions outlined in the website’s policy49.  Romania  Romania initiated, together with the Netherlands and Hungary, the GFCE initiative for CVD with  the objective to share experiences and lessons learned in CVD. According to ENISA, the  National Cyber Security Directorate (NCSD) participates in the initiative on CVD, ‘having  46 Portuguese National Cybersecurity Centre (CNCS) (2020), National Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.0 EN, April.

The GFCE website mentions, among the expected outcomes of initiatives, the draft of a CVD  policy at the national level in Romania51. No advancement in the GFCE initiative seems to be  currently on the way.  Slovenia  Slovenia has not yet implemented a CVD policy. The country is planning to include a CVD  policy in the next cybersecurity strategy. A CVD policy will likely be included in an amendment  to the Information Security Act, which transposed the NIS Directive into national legislation and  was adopted in 2018, or even as a new act considering the NIS2 directive transposition into  national legislation.  Most likely, the envisaged responsible body will be the national CERT. The Information Security  Administration will also conduct awareness-raising campaigns aimed at tackling the entities that  have been opposing the establishment of a CVD policy in the past.  Indeed as of 2018 the SI-CERT had proposed to add this topic to the upcoming law on  information security, while no consensus for support was reached at that time. The highlighted  challenges related in particular to the awareness of decision-makers at the political level on the  current best practices in the information security community52. The 2018 Information Security  Act did not make any reference to CVD, although providing that competent national authority  ‘may inform the public about individual incidents … when disclosure is in the public interest’53.  The 2020 Digital Slovenia Strategy for the Information Society54 does not make any reference to  CVD neither.  Slovakia  Slovakia has not yet implemented a CVD policy. However, a CVD policy mechanism is available  in Slovakia at the level of CERT. In 2019, the SK-CERT has published its ‘Vulnerability  Reporting Guideline’ 55.  The National Cyber Security Centre SK-CERT published this guideline as a recommended  procedure for vulnerability reporting. The guideline is also suitable for vulnerability reporting in  products and services of the National Security Authority and SK-CERT.  On a legislative level, while there is no CVD policy in place, there are implicitly established  processes regarding CVD.

The Cybersecurity Act (CSA)56 mentions ‘vulnerability’ only as part of ex ante security measures  mandatory for essential services providers and the public sector. The delegated Act.  no. 362/2018 then elaborates more on the importance of establishing the ex ante security  measures on the known vulnerabilities and processes of revision. The delegated Act  no. 436/2019 Coll. requires to check if the vulnerabilities and the vulnerability revision processes  are present in the security measures and documentation. The delegated Act no. 166/2018 Coll.  binds the CSIRT teams to safeguarding confidentiality once a vulnerability is discovered during  their operations.  Thus, while a CVD policy is not present, it might be subsumed under Art. 8 of the CSA which  constitutes the single point of contact regarding the cybersecurity issues for essential services  operators and the public sector. The kind of cyber security information that the constituency  should be reporting to the established single point of contact is broadly defined. Therefore, even  vulnerability reports might be included. Although, they are not explicitly mentioned.  Finland  Finland has no CVD policy in place at this time and there is no mention of vulnerabilities in the  law. That said, they do appear to be making efforts in this direction.  In 2010, the National Cyber Security Center Finland (NCSC FI) had published a vulnerability  coordination policy as an effort to spell out their position and to initiate a discussion on the topic.  According to representatives from the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency  (Traficom), the policy published in 2010 was not widely implemented across the country.  However, the overall good situation with vulnerability management in the country could explain  the limited application of this CVD policy.  Nevertheless, the policy has been used as a policy template to help vendors evaluate their own  policies. It is envisaged that it will be updated and promoted at the level of decision-makers to  form a national CVD policy, especially in the context of the new provisions that will stem from  the NIS2 directive.  The role of CERT FI should also be mentioned. According to ENISA, there are three CSIRTs  that have ‘extensive experience with coordinating vulnerability disclosure. These are CERT FI in  Finland, JP-CERT in Japan and CERT-CC in the United States. The work carried out by these  coordination centres is widely recognised and it is recommended that since they already have  the know-how they should continue to lead these activities’57.  CERT FI acts as coordinator in the process of vulnerability disclosure. The aim of the centre is  that the information about vulnerabilities, related patches and updates, reaches all involved  parties, including the end users of products. CERT FI ensures that as many major vulnerabilities  as possible are patched and that fixes are applied. As a vulnerability coordinator, it promotes  56 European Commission (2019), Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019  on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology  cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (Text with EEA relevance)  PE/86/2018/REV/1, Brussels, 7.6.2019  57 ENISA (2015), Good Practice Guide on Vulnerability Disclosure – From challenges to recommendations.

CERT FI handles about 50 vulnerabilities every year.  Private organisations operating in Finland, such as the Cisco Product Security Incident  Response Team58, acknowledge the collaboration with third-party coordination centres such as  CERT FI to manage a coordinated disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to them and impacting  multiple vendors59.  CERT FI sends information and news about vulnerabilities to customers on an almost daily  basis and researches Finland’s situation when a newly released vulnerability seems like it might  affect Finland. The Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability is a good example of this type of  activity. CERT FI was mapping the situation in Finland when the vulnerability was released. The  centre contacted every vulnerable organisation via email or direct phone calls. Over a month, all  the vulnerable exchange servers (300) in Finland were patched.  Moreover, the ‘white hat hacker’60 ecosystem in Finland is quite active and CERT  FI receives a handful of vulnerability notifications/reports from them every year.  The bug bounty programs are also popular in Finland.  Sweden  Sweden does not have a CVD policy in place at a national level and there is no plan to  implement one at this stage. The 2017 national cybersecurity strategy61 does not provide any  indications for developing CVD mechanisms.  The Swedish national CSIRT, CERT-SE, gets involved in 5–10 cases per year, where CERT- SE preferably supports the resolution of vulnerabilities by helping reporters reach the  manufacturers, guids reporters and manufacturers to business standard procedures and, if  needed, acts as an intermediary between the two.  Sweden-based companies such as Swedbank, Northvolt or Klarna appreciate security  researchers and encourage them to report potential vulnerabilities identified in any product,  system or asset and offer responsible disclosure program guidelines62. Other companies use  private initiatives like HackerOne or OpenBugBounty to be notified about vulnerabilities and  interact with reporters.  2.4 CVD OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION  This Section provides an overview of the CVD-related practices outside the  European Union, in particular, it explores the latest trends in the People’s Republic  of China, the United States of America and Japan.

China’s process is one ‘in which high threat vulnerabilities are  likely evaluated for their utility in intelligence operations before they’re published [on the  Chinese National Vulnerability Database], and the publication is made or delayed for these high  threat vulnerabilities based on whether they can be operationally useful to the [Ministry of State  Security] whether for domestic surveillance or foreign intelligence operations’65. It is likely that  the Chinese government holds on to high value vulnerabilities to be used for national security  goals. One reason to believe that is the delay in publishing these vulnerabilities compared to the  lower-threat ones: from 21 to even 156 days longer. For instance, the vulnerability CVE-2017- 0199 of Microsoft Office was revealed by Chinese databases with a delay of nearly 2 months –  sufficient time to exploit this software vulnerability and launch attacks against other countries or  organisations. It is no coincidence that this same vulnerability is at the heart of both WannaCry  and NotPetya attacks.  In 2020, the Chinese government was looking at introducing specific rules on how to disclose  vulnerabilities, and to require researchers to report them to authorities before making them  public. It is a crucial issue because media, in this manner, are limited from publishing any  vulnerability details before they have been communicated to the competent authorities. This  limitation weighs on companies and individuals who will receive information with a significant  delay66. In 2019, there were various thefts of high-profile data in Chinal, such as internet café  customers’ information or sensitive medical data. Therefore, the official reason for the massive  government presence was the need to not compromise national security and public interests. At  the same time, it was required that Chinese nationals assisted the cyber efforts of the country67.  Already in Article 7 of the cybersecurity law (2017) citizens are required to support and  cooperate with national intelligence services. This assistance to the institutions becomes explicit  in the regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products (2021)  which will be explained below.  To better understand the new law on vulnerability disclosure, it is helpful to briefly describe the  current Chinese cybersecurity legal system. The Chinese cybersecurity legal system is  organised in a pyramid with the national security law of 2005 at the top and the cybersecurity  law of 2017 one step below it. The cybersecurity law, approved since 2016, aims to safeguard  the Chinese ‘cyberspace sovereignty’ by strengthening existing regulations that concern cyber  activities. For instance, companies that did not store their data in China at that time had to  purchase cloud sharing services to avoid heavy fines68. The network security is the goal set to  protect citizens’ rights and interests, safeguard national security and promote economic  development. To achieve network security, the law requires network owners and network  operators to adopt security measures such as security incident recording or the establishment of  security management bodies. In addition, companies supplying network products and services  in China must comply with the mandatory national security maintenance requirements. Those  that do not comply with the cybersecurity law may receive fines up to 1 000 000 RMB  (132 719 EUR69), face an arrest of operations and even incur the revocation of business  64 O’Neill, P. H.

The cybersecurity law confirms and consolidates the passage from elective regimes  toward obligatory standards and requirements in the cybersecurity field.  At the bottom of this legislative pyramid, stands the data security law and the abovementioned  regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products, both entered into  force at the beginning of September 2021. The latter has many implications, which are explored  below.  Regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products  On 1 September 2021, new regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in  network products came into effect. They have been drafted and updated for two years, since  2019, before their official release.  In these 2 years there have been six rounds of updates and implementations, which indicates  the great interest that the various ministries have in this area. The first three steps were  necessary for the Chinese government to incorporate the various opinions of interested  stakeholders. The regulations were introduced on 19 June 2019; the opinions of the community  have been accepted since 10 August 2019; and in November the Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology (MIIT) held a forum for enterprises, seeking advice, and to collect  opinions from the industry. The fourth round, from December 2019 to December 2020, was the  most important one because it involved a long negotiation between the MIIT, the Ministry of  Public Security (MPS), the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the network  operators. Following this negotiation, the articles of the regulations increased from 8 to 16.  Finally, from December 2020 to May 2021, the final draft of the legislation has been submitted  to the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission for the final review and the regulation was  officially issued simultaneously by the three ministries (MIIT, CAC and MPS) on 13 July 2021.  The regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products is not the  only law that came into force on 1 September, as the new regulations to protect the critical  information infrastructure, were also released. They underline the importance of network threats  and vulnerabilities along withcybersecurity monitoring, handling and emergency response. As  already mentioned, the data security law also became effective, giving network operators a few  directions on how to perform security protection obligations to protect networks from  interference, damage or unauthorised access, and prevent network data from being disclosed,  stolen or tampered with. The latest noteworthy act is the personal information protection law, the  Chinese version of the general data protection regulation (GDPR), which focuses on the  governance of Internet platforms and provides for an emergency plan in the event of personal  information security incidents.  The management and security vulnerabilities law  The regulations on the management of security vulnerabilities in network products find their  legislative basis in Article 22 of the cybersecurity law: ‘when a provider of network products or  services discovers security defects or vulnerabilities in its network product or services, it shall  take remedial measures immediately, inform users in time and report to the competent  authorities in accordance with relevant regulations’.  The competent authority is subsequently indicated in the Ministry of Industry and Information  Technology (MIIT). The law’s legislative intent is managing what they define ‘network products’,  i.e. all devices that can be connected to the internet. Product vulnerabilities are key because  they constitute one of the greatest threats to digital infrastructure security. In this view, the  regulation shifts the emphasis on network product providers who are responsible for ensuring  the cybersecurity of their products.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  38  They are required to fix security vulnerabilities of their network products, eliminate security risk  from the source of threats, prevent security incidents caused by malicious exploitations and  effectively support the high-quality development of the digital economy, consolidating the  security foundations of the rapidly developing digital society. More generally, four major  objectives can be recognised in this regulation: maintain national cybersecurity; regulate  vulnerability-related behaviours (standardise vulnerability discovery, reporting, patching and  release); clarify the responsibilities and obligations of the network product providers, network  operators and organisations or individuals engaged in vulnerability-related activities;  encouraging various entities to make full use of their technical advantages to discover, collect  and release vulnerabilities. There is a clear desire to standardise the behaviour of the various  actors involved but above all to avoid that information on vulnerabilities is managed  independently.  Another important aspect of the regulations is to define the role of the three Chinese ministries  that participated in the consultations prior to the publication of the new package of laws. There  is a clear division of supervision responsibilities that can be derived from Article 3 of the  regulations. The CAC is responsible for overall coordination of network product security  vulnerability management. MIIT, a strong ministry which can easily handle the product vendors  (included cars and airplanes companies), is responsible both for the comprehensive  management of network product security vulnerabilities and for the telecom and internet  industry network product security vulnerability supervision. Finally, the MPS is the ministry in  charge of combating illegal and criminal activities by exploiting loopholes according to the law. It  is responsible for the supervision and management of network product security vulnerabilities.  The collaboration between these three ministries is regulated by Articles 3 and 7 of the  regulations and can be divided into three areas. The first one provides real-time vulnerabilities  information sharing among three departments: the Network Security Threat Information Sharing  Platform of the MIIT, the National Cybersecurity Notification Center of the MPS and the Chinese  National Vulnerabilities Database (CNVD) of CN-CERT under the China Internet Network  Information Center of the CAC. The second one states that the security vulnerabilities of major  network products must be jointly evaluated and handled by the three departments. The last area  concerns the vulnerability registration platform managed by MIIT, which subsequently informs  the MPS and the China Internet Network Information Center.  As previously mentioned, one of the main purposes of the Chinese government is to use this  new regulation to standardise the behaviour towards the discovery and disclosure of  vulnerabilities. The goal is to ensure clear disclosure rules for the researchers, an almost  immediate fix by the product providers and effective verification of the repair by network  operators.  The law can be summarised as follows70.  • Art. 4 lists the red lines that demarcate the boundary of what organisations and  individuals shall not do. Three prohibitions should be mentioned. The first one is not to  compromise cybersecurity, i.e. no organisation or individual may take advantage of the  security vulnerabilities of network products to engage in activities that endanger  cybersecurity. The second prohibition is not to illegally collect, sell or publish  information about security vulnerabilities of network products. The third one regards  more generally hazardous activities and the right behaviour to avoid them. Together  70 Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission (2021), ‘Notice of the Minitry of Industry and Information  Technology and the States Internet Information Office of the Ministry of Public Security on Issuing the regulations on the  management of network product security vulnerabilities’.

For  instance, they are required to share all vulnerability reports with the MIIT within two  days (7.2) and are encouraged to set up a reward mechanism for reported  vulnerabilities (7.3) as a sort of bug bounty program.  • Art. 8 is dedicated to network operators and contains only one paragraph regarding the  timely verification of communicated vulnerabilities and their repair in a short time. The  requirements are higher for the reporters, so as to exercise a strict control over them,  and they decrease with the network product providers, only to be minimized for  network operators. The reason is that in China the latter are state-owned companies,  hence, they are already directly regulated. Therefore, although the Article 8 is very  short, the level of control is not lower than the one exercised on reporters and vendors.  • Art 9 is dedicated to organisations and individuals who discover a vulnerability. It  prohibits researchers from disclosing vulnerabilities details before a vendor has had a  reasonable chance to patch and prevent cybersecurity risks (9.1). It prohibits  researchers from exaggerating risks associated with security flaws or using a  vulnerability to extort vendors (9.3). It prohibits the publication of programs and tools to  exploit vulnerabilities and put networks at risk (9.4). It prohibits disclosing vulnerability  details to ‘overseas organisations or individuals other than network product providers’  (9.7)71.  • Art. 10 regulates the procedure that network operators and product vendors must  follow to report any vulnerability they face. It mandates that any organisation, or  individual researcher, register their vulnerability reporting platforms with the MIIT  (which has the duty to notify the MPS and the CAC). It is important to distinguish that  the report is not anonymous for the companies but can be for the researcher when  they inform the company. Furthermore, these actors are encouraged to submit  vulnerability information to the relevant platforms of the MIIT and the CAC. Following  the red lines set in Article 4, the penalties concern respectively the three main actors of  the new regulations (product vendors, network operators and reporters) and the  hazardous activities.  • Art. 12 is specific to product vendors. It punishes both failures to take measures to  remedy or report network product security vulnerabilities and the circumstances  specified in Art. 60 of the cybersecurity law.  • Art. 13 punishes network operators if no measures are taken to repair or prevent  network product security vulnerabilities, also applying the situations specified in Art. 59  of the cybersecurity law.  71 Cinpanu, C. (2021), ‘Chinese government lays out new vulnerability disclosure rules’, The Record. Available at:  https://therecord.media/chinese-government-lays-out-new-vulnerability-disclosure-rules/  https://therecord.media/chinese-government-lays-out-new-vulnerability-disclosure-rules/  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  40  • Art. 14 addresses the penalties for reporters based on a misconduct collecting or  publishing information about network product security vulnerabilities and in Art. 62 of  the cybersecurity law.  • Art. 15 covers hazardous activities. It punishes those who use the security  vulnerabilities of network products to engage in activities endangering network security  or provide technical support for others to engage in activities endangering network  security by taking advantage of the security vulnerabilities of network products  (including the circumstances specified in Art. 63 of the cybersecurity law).  The new regulations aim on one hand to improve the working mechanism for vulnerability  reporting, evaluation, patching and release. On the other hand, they aim to strengthen technical  support with the construction of the Network Security Threat Information Sharing Platform of the  MIIT which will collect, evaluate and process vulnerabilities (and share information with the  other vulnerability platforms and ministries).  When it comes to data collection, the main one collects information from different platforms,  each dedicated to a specific sector: the China Academy of Information and Communications  Technology for common network product vulnerability; the China Software Testing Center for  mobile internet app vulnerability; or the China Automotive Technology and Research Center for  vulnerabilities regarding automobiles.  Implications of the new rules  According to some security analysts, the obligation to report all vulnerability details to the MIIT  within 2 days after the discovery is the most troubling part of the law72. In particular, they notice  that if other countries start imposing the same requirements on security researchers, it adds risk  in aggregating unpatched vulnerability data, creating an unprecedented treasure trove of  unpatched bugs for our adversaries to attack and steal. Another issue is represented by western  bug bounty platforms that have been working with Chinese security researchers for the past  years. The fear is that they will provide the Chinese government with a way to be aware of any  vulnerability disclosure programme that includes Chinese researchers who report weaknesses  (even from non-Chinese companies)73.  Furthermore, according to other analysts, these new rules will reduce any prior flexibility security  researchers had and will oblige them to share security research with the Chinese government.  This probably will not imply a rise in the volume of attacks but an increase in sophistication.  There will be repercussions on western organisations that are carrying out research and  development activities in China, since the Chinese government will identify the vulnerabilities in  their products before them74. Despite the fact that the provision allows the disclosure of cyber  weaknesses to foreign manufacturers, there is no guarantee that this will happen.  Japan75  In Japan, the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities in products such as software is performed  in accordance with the ‘Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline’ (hereafter  ‘Guideline’). This guideline is based on a 2004 notification from the Ministry of Economy, Trade  and Industry (METI) entitled ‘Standards for Handling Software Vulnerability Information and  Others’, which was amended in 2014 and 2017. The notification was renamed ‘Standards for  72 Balaji, N. (2021), ‘Zero-day bugs must be reported to government within 2 days of discovery – New Chinese IT law’,  CyberSecurityNews.

The  guideline was created and jointly announced in cooperation with several industry organisations,  namely the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), the  Japan Information Technology Service Industry Association (JISA), the Computer Software  Association of Japan (CSAJ) and the Japan Network Security Association (JNSA). It serves as  a recommendation to parties relevant to the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. The  recommended processes in the guideline are in alignment with ISO/IEC 29147:2014  ‘Vulnerability disclosure’. For the purposes of this document, vulnerabilities in products such as  software and firmware will be considered.  In this guideline, vulnerability reports from researchers are sent to the Information-technology  Promotion Agency (IPA), a policy implementation agency under the jurisdiction of METI  handling initial analysis and triage. After this process, the reports are sent to the JPCERT  Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC), an independent, non-profit organisation funded by METI for  coordination with the vendor/developer of the product. Once the vulnerability has been  addressed by the vendor/developer, an advisory will be published on Japan Vulnerability Notes  (JVN), typically in conjunction with an advisory from the vendor/developer. Through this  coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, a total of 1 875 advisories have been published on  JVN as of March 2021.  While this coordinated vulnerability disclosure process has worked fairly well, the number of  reports received has increased significantly over the past few years. Various factors have  caused this increase, among them being an increase in the overall awareness of security  vulnerabilities, in the number of researchers searching for vulnerabilities, in the number of  products available and in the availability of easy-to-use tools for vulnerability discovery. The  increase in reports has led to a process overflow where some reports are not being handled in a  timely manner. The guideline initially stated that all reported vulnerabilities must be coordinated  and subsequently disclosed on JVN after the vulnerability has been addressed. While it is  probably best to coordinate and disclose all reported vulnerabilities, regardless of their severity  or the number of users that a particular product has, this is not practical in practice. Also, since  this guideline has been published, many vendors/developers have become receptive to the  coordinated vulnerability disclosure process, but there remain vendors/developers that are not.  As a recommendation for creating a policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure, the  experiences in Japan lead to the following considerations.  • Incentive should be provided to researchers to report vulnerabilities to an organisation  that can directly address the vulnerability or at least coordinate with an organisation  that can address the vulnerability.  • Monetary incentive should also be provided (bug bounty).  • Recognition should also be provided (credit on an advisory).  • Incentives should be provided to vendors to support the coordinated disclosure of  vulnerabilities.  • Vendors should be allowed to promote their own actions to address vulnerabilities as a  good practice (market appeal).  • Third-party coordinators can also provide value in this process.  • Advisories should be published so that information can reach a wider audience.  • Support should be provided in the coordination process where multiple organisations  need to be contacted with a vulnerability (multi-party coordination).  • The coordination process should be clarified so that researchers know how a reported  vulnerability will be coordinated and disclosed.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  42  • Vendors should be taught how to create a coordination process so that researchers  know vendors will address reported vulnerabilities.  United States of America76  The US technical and security community has been concerned with vulnerability disclosure for  decades. In 2002, in what was not the first attempt to standardise CVD behaviour, an IETF draft  standard, prepared by research experts from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IEFT), which  develops and promotes voluntary internet standards, noted that the issue had been ‘a divisive  topic for years’77. Security experts, industry leaders, and policymakers have sought to balance  the need to protect users from those who seek to exploit vulnerabilities, the rights and roles of  security researchers and those who make and maintain the systems that everyone uses. What  was once a contentious area rife with conflict has seen an emerging consensus in the United  States, with government policy and law supporting private-sector leadership. While there are no  one-size-fits-all solutions, there can exist best practices and accepted ways of handling  vulnerability information.  Early governament response to vulnerabilities: coordination and anti-hacking statutes  The initial approach to protect the public took two forms. First, the software and security  communities realised that software vulnerabilities required organised coordination. Following the  infamous Morris Worm that brought down much of the Internet in 1988 and demonstrated the  risks of vulnerable systems, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)  established the Computer Emergency Response Team, now known as the CERT Coordination  Center or CERT/CC. This organisation plays a number of roles in securing the internet,  including acting as a ‘trusted third party’ that could facilitate communication between the then  small but burgeoning security research community, and the relatively small number of software  vendors.  Early computer exploits in the 1980s also drove the government to punish bad actors in the new  and poorly understood domain, in an attempt to discourage their activities. The legislature  targeted malicious behaviour in the US anti-hacking statute, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  (CFAA). Passed in 1986 and amended in 1994 and 1996, the law can apply to anyone who  accesses a computer without authorisation, with criminal and civil penalties. This law is  controversial among cyber law scholars, and many early judicial interpretations set a very broad  scope that would include much potentially beneficial security research.  Software vendors could also use American copyright law to deter security research. The Digital  Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA 1998) was a landmark attempt to balance copyright and the  free flow of information in the internet age. Section 1201 of this law criminalises attempts to  circumvent access control to a copyrighted work, regardless of the intent, although there are  now recent exemptions to DMCA for security research. Since much software is copyrighted  under US law, and basic technical protection measures are often included, this law has been  used to threaten and prosecute hackers who have identified vulnerabilities in software. Some of  these vulnerabilities were used maliciously to the detriment of companies and innocent users,  but others may have been used more constructively. Both the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  (CFAA) and DMCA were used to threaten security research, and authorities ultimately had to  clarify what they meant.  76 This Section of the report was a contribution by Allan Friedman, Director of Cybersecurity Initiatives at the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), US Department of Commerce, to the 2018 CEPS Task Force  on Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe – see footnote (7).  77 Christey, S.

Available at: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-christey-wysopal-vuln-disclosure-00  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  43  Chaos and contention  As the security community slowly grew in the early 2000s, the relationship between security  researchers and vendors grew worse in the US. While some disclosures were successfully  coordinated, often with little fanfare, there were enough high profile incidents to make trust a  real issue. There was real concern among the security community that vendors simply were not  taking software security as seriously as the researchers. For their part, vendors did not  understand the motives or actions of the security research community, and often had real  difficulty distinguishing between those who were attacking their software for malicious purposes  and those who had no ill will. CERT/CC still played an important role in facilitating disclosure,  but as an intermediary. They were criticised by both sides for being overly sympathetic and  allied with the other side.  Absent clear guidance, some security researchers worked to create their own broad policies.  Nomad Mobile Research Centre, a hacker collective, established their own policy in 1999 on  disclosure with windows of one week or one month depending on the severity of each case78. A  more famous one was posted to the BugTraq mailing list by respected hacker Rain Forest  Puppy as a response to complaints that researchers never notified vendors or gave them a  chance to respond. This policy gave a window of 2 (later 5) days for response from the vendor,  demanding regular communication but not setting a specific timeline on fixing the vulnerability.  The underlying debate was between private disclosure and full disclosure. The former was  criticised as ineffective, while the latter was condemned as socially irresponsible. This debate  was even picked up by the nascent academic research community on the economics of  information security, though they also failed to find an optimal response79. One low point in this  period of distrust can be seen in 2009, with a presentation at the security conference  CanSecWest preaching the mantra of ‘no more free bugs’, arguing that the legal and  professional risks of working with vendors outweighed the benefits of selling them to any paying  customer or simply disclosing them publicly80.  Collaboration and CVD  By the early 2010s, it was clear to many in the community that the status quo was not  sustainable. Security researchers were growing in number and wanted a safer ecosystem.  Vendors were beginning to appreciate the role of external researchers. Cooperation began  more explicitly as companies posted disclosure policies, and the idea of bug bounties spread  from a revolutionary concept to an emerging business practice.  The American government followed suit to help shore up collaboration, through a variety of  means. An early step was taken in 2013, when the Federal Trade Commission, the consumer  protection agency, filed a complaint against mobile device manufacturer HTC for failing to  employ ‘‘reasonable security’81. While numerous lapses were alleged, the fifth of five charges  was the failure ‘to implement a process for receiving and addressing security vulnerability  reports from third-party researchers’.  As the issue became more common, it became clear that the private sector could benefit from  clarity.

This process brought  together very diverse viewpoints, while emphasising that there was no one-size-fits-all solution.  Participants in this process developed a template disclosure policy to make it easier for  organisations to begin a CVD process; conducted research to understand researcher and  vendor motivations and concerns; and developed a framework for multiparty disclosure  involving vulnerabilities that affect multiple vendors.  Other government agencies followed in quick order. In 2015, the FTC included vulnerability  disclosure in the cybersecurity guide for businesses83. By the end of 2016, regulators like the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Highway Transportation and Safety  Administration highlighted CVD as an important part of cybersecurity guidance and best  practices for medical devices and modern vehicles. The FDA’s programme is particularly  noteworthy, as it establishes incentives for medical device manufacturers to learn about and  deal with vulnerabilities quickly, rather than avoid knowing about them.  Even the often-conservative Department of Defence (DoD) joined the CVD throng. In 2016, in  addition to their targeted bug bounty programme for the Pentagon’s website, the DoD  announced a CVD policy for all public-facing systems. Then Secretary of Defence Ash Carter  described it in common terms as a ‘see something, say something’ policy for the digital  domain’84.  As CVD practices spread across the American economy, the law had to catch up as well. In  October 2015, the United States Copyright Office recommended exemptions under the DMCA  for ‘good faith security research’ on the computer systems that are built into voting machines,  motorised land vehicles and implantable medical devices85. Researchers looking for  vulnerabilities in these categories of systems could no longer be targeted for criminal or civil  penalties under the DMCA – vulnerabilities in voting machines have since attracted strong  attention in the United States. The Copyright Office agreed with NTIA that copyright law may be  a poor vehicle for cybersecurity policy, and many anticipate that further calls will be made for the  Copyright Office to exempt other categories of systems for security research.  The US anti-hacking law (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)) still remains in force to  protect American computer systems, but the Department of Justice has acknowledged the  importance of securing the role of security research. In 2014, the Department issued guidance  for federal prosecutors contemplating charges under the CFAA. While there is no carve-out or  even any explicit reference to security research or disclosure, the guidance lists factors to  consider to ‘ensure that charges are brought only in cases that serve a substantial federal  interest’. The Cybersecurity Unit of the DoJ went further in 2017 by offering a Framework for  Vulnerability Disclosure Programs. The goal of this guidance was to assist in the development  of CVD programs to clarify ‘authorised vulnerability disclosure and discovery conduct, thereby  substantially reducing the likelihood that such described activities will result in a civil or criminal  violation of law.’  One common theme across the different legal and policy approaches to CVD is that they  acknowledge the inherent diversity in CVD programs, based on an organisation’s systems,  capacity and preferences. The DoJ guidance makes it clear that ‘different organisations may  82 Simpson, A.

CERT/CC still plays a role as a coordinator, but acting as a  single neutral party has not scaled as the digital world has grown and they now offer expertise  while supporting others in their efforts. CERT/CC joined a group of security experts to advocate  CVD’s inclusion in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a key security strategy and standards  document for the US economy. It is acknowledged in the 2017 2nd draft of the Cybersecurity  Framework Version 1.1, which notes the importance of ‘processes … established to receive,  analyse and respond to vulnerabilities disclosed to the organisation from internal and external  sources (e.g., internal testing, security bulletins or security researchers)’86.  Vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) platform87  In autumn 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released the  binding operational directive (BOD 20-01) in support of better management and resolution of  software vulnerabilities. The purpose was to strengthen the cybersecurity of federal civilian  agencies by requiring them to establish policies that would allow external researchers to report  vulnerabilities. On July 30 2021, to consolidate this goal, CISA released a new service for the  disclosure of vulnerabilities: the vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) platform. This service  provides a website suitable for receiving vulnerability reports from both security researchers and  private citizens. The Platform is offered by CISA’s Cyber Quality Services Management Office  (QSMO) and provided by BugCrowd and EnDyna.  Along these lines, federal civilian agencies can benefit from QSMO shared services with  consequent savings on a development of independent systems. CISA has calculated savings on  government-wide costs of more than 10 million USD. Furthermore, thanks to the platform,  agencies can receive more information on their possible vulnerabilities that will help in  maintaining cybersecurity.  The service providers, BugCrowd and EnDyna, will be responsible for an initial estimate of the  reports received. Agencies can then devote their time to vulnerabilities that could have a real  impact. With this project, CISA wants to help the Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB)  agencies manage vulnerabilities in their informatic systems. The VDP platform makes it easier  for the FCEB to coordinate with reporters, helping secure information exchange and increasing  collaboration between the public and private sectors.  The process that led to the VDP included a comment period on the draft. Given the relevance of  the topic, for the first time CISA allowed a binding operational directive to be subject to public  comments before it was issued. Consequently, since November 2019, CISA has received many  suggestions for improvements, such as introducing legal parameters for the protection of  researchers or defining a mandatory timeline for vulnerabilities’ remediation. Jeannette Manfra,  assistant director of cybersecurity at CISA at the time, was clearly on the side of the research  community: ‘A VDP allows people who have “seen something” to “say something” to those who  can fix it. It makes it clear that an agency welcomes and authorizes good faith security research  on specific, internet-accessible systems’88. Finding and reporting a vulnerability for the common  good shouldn’t involve the risk of a legal action.  Currently, CISA coordinated vulnerability disclosure process consists of five steps89.  86 NIST (2017), Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity – Version 1.1 (Draft 2), December.

When receiving a report, CISA has the task of carrying out an initial  screening to ensure the presence of the vulnerability and that it has not already been  reported. After the first check, CISA can collect the report with all the relevant  information. A vulnerability report can be collected through CISA vulnerability analysis;  checking public information on software vulnerabilities; or through a researcher who  submits it.  • Analysis. In this part, CISA works together with the vendor(s) to study the vulnerability  by examining both the technical problems and the risks it could pose.  • Mitigation coordination. Continuing closely with the vendor(s), CISA will work to find a  way to fix the issue by developing a mitigation (for instance a patch or an update).  • Application of mitigation. Affected end users must test and apply the mitigation prior to  public disclosure. This happens at this stage.  • Disclosure. As a last step, CISA will notify affected users about the vulnerability  through its channels. It is important to underline that this phase is characterized by the  coordination between CISA, the affected vendor(s) and the source of the vulnerability  report.  After examining the behaviour that CISA intends to implement, it is necessary to assume the  case that a vendor is not responsive or does not establish a reasonable timeline for the  mitigation. In this scenario, CISA can disclose a vulnerability 45 days after the first attempt to  contact the vendor, regardless of the availability of a mitigation.  With the continuous increase and evolution of cyber threats, it is necessary for vendors to  become aware of their role and the support that security researchers can offer them. CISA is at  the forefront to help identify and implement the best practices in this process90.  90 Goldstein, E. (2021), ‘CISA announces new vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) platform’.

CVD POLICY PRACTICES  3.1 DESIRED ELEMENTS OF CVD PROCESSES  The next Section provides more detailed information, gathered through the consultation with  Member States, on the different elements of the CVD processes and procedures established, or  soon to be established, in the different EU countries.  Entities Involved  As mentioned in the Carnegie-Mellon’s ‘CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability  Disclosure’, certain roles are critical to the CVD process91.  • Finder – the individual or organisation that identifies the vulnerability.  • Reporter – the individual or organisation that notifies the vendor of the vulnerability.  • Vendor – the individual or organisation that created or maintains the product that is  vulnerable.  • Deployer – the individual or organisation that must deploy a patch or take other  remediation action.  • Coordinator – an individual or organisation that facilitates the coordinated response  process.  Interactions among these actors are illustrated in Figure 3.  Figure 1 – Visualisation of the Entities Involved in the CVD process  Source: Householder, Allen D., et al. The CERT guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Carnegie- Mellon University Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, United States, 2017, p. 15  91 Householder, A. D., et al. (2017), The CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Carnegie-Mellon University,  Pittsburgh PA, United States, p. 15  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  48  Most of the Member States anticipate the involvement of the national CERT and/or the national  cybersecurity authority in the CVD process with a coordination role. As already mentioned in the  previous Section, the mediation role is important for managing parties’ expectations in terms of  disclosure. The CERT can mediate the conversation between the parties to meet the needs of  the vendors and help to decide the appropriate time to disclose the vulnerability. Besides, the  involvement of the national CERT is considered central in all the cases in which the researcher  wishes to keep its anonymity, and in the cases in which the vulnerability is found in the CERT’s  constituency.  Among the tasks of the coordinator according to stakeholders consulted are: the identification of  stakeholders to involve in the process (e.g. when a researcher does not know whom to report  the vulnerability to); the management of information flows from reporting to the full disclosure  (e.g. when the vulnerability owner might hold a threatening or untrustworthy attitude towards the  researcher or when they decides not to address the matter and thus reject the treatment of a  vulnerability); providing security researchers with a protection and/or legal shield; setting up  cooperation rules in vulnerability management processes; ensuring an objective risk  assessment (e.g. by filtering low-quality reports from researchers not meeting expectations set  out in the CVD policy).  In some cases, the national CERT together with the community of security researchers will be /  is also responsible for the discovery process. For example, the Tallinn University of Technology  and the University of Tartu are very renowned in terms of cryptographic skills and have been  responsible, together with the national CERT, for the discovery of the abovementioned ROCA  vulnerability in the Estonian eID system.  In terms of communication and coordination, the parties involved can vary according to the  vulnerability discovered. In case a vulnerability is found in a specific database, the relevant  sectoral authorities usually participate in the CVD process. For public disclosure, private  companies can also be integrated into the process.  Finally, as shown in Figure 4, the entities involved vary among the Member States according to  whether the focus of the CVD policy is / will be on the public sector only. In this case, the  implementation of the policy is usually handled by the national CERT and the public sector  institutions that are willing to participate. For example, it could be up to the public institutions to  identify which resources can/should be tested (e.g. their website or their portal). However, it  should be noted that, even in the cases in which a national CVD policy does not focus on  private entities as such, private companies are usually allowed and encouraged to publish their  own CVD policy.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  49  Figure 2 – Entities Involved in the CVD process  Source: Interviews with EU Member States  Role of CERTs  Stemming from the consultations, two approaches can be identified concerning what role the  Member States envisage for the national CERT:  In some cases, the national CERT only acts as an observer. The entities involved in these  cases are simply the researcher and vulnerability owner. Only in cases where the vulnerability  owner does not respond to the researcher requests for contact will the CERTs come into play. If  needed, the national CERT can be present in the different steps of the process but, ideally, just  as an observer. In the case of multiparty CVD, the role of the CERT as a coordinator is more  relevant.  In other cases, the CERT rather plays a central role. The CERT is indeed in charge of the  implementation of the law and provides guidance and procedures allowing researchers to  benefit from the safe harbour.  Tools  The tool that most countries are planning to adopt or have already adopted is a dedicated  website for receiving requests for coordination/intervention, and to provide a template for  notification reports.  The implementation of a ticketing system has also been mentioned by several countries as an  established good practice. Every mail is sent to the ticketing system, as such, in case the  personnel is unavailable, all information will be logged. This pipeline should have permanent  support.  Custom tools with enhanced security have also been mentioned by several countries as useful  systems to be adopted in the context of a CVD process. The Estonian national CERT for  example uses and publicly provides on its website the Cuckoo Sandbox for automated malware  analysis, which has proved to be a useful tool in finding vulnerabilities.  On the assessment side, validation tools can be used (e.g. Burp suite) to verify the material  that is sent out. Burp is generally used for the reproduction and assessment of the severity of  the vulnerability.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  50  Besides, in a CVD process communication tools are needed, especially in multiparty  processes where there are requirements for ensuring the confidentiality of communications. In  this respect, communication systems that are pluggable, decentralised and exchangeable are  needed.  Mechanisms can also be established to find vulnerabilities through open-source intelligence  software. ShadowServer or Abuse scan the IP address and disseminate to the national CSIRT  the vulnerabilities found on the public IPs – those of Critical Operators for example – that are  shared with the national CERT.  In more general terms, the tools that are needed depend on the tasks to be performed. For  example, to analyse and exploit vulnerabilities, there is a need for a lab network where  vulnerable systems can be tested (e.g. testing whether the received report is trustworthy before  addressing the vendor).  3.1.2.1 Common Security Advisory Framework  In Germany, the BSI has in place a warning and information service system. This is a decade- old website where advisories are published daily. It can be regarded as an advisory database  accessible to the BSI constituency. More detailed information is instead sent to government  entities and critical infrastructures operators. This is one of the most important services that the  BSI provides to help its constituency with patch management. In this context, the drafting of the  advisories is crucial. The BSI has been very keen on fostering automation in vulnerability  management. Each advisory information should hence be machine-readable. Together with  national and international partners, the BSI is therefore working on a solution to make it easier  for users to find, evaluate and implement security advisories. The machine-processable format  for security advisories, the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0, will make a  decisive contribution to ensuring that companies can supervise and secure their systems. Two  tools, in particular, have been introduced in the context of the CSAF.  • CSAF Aggregator. It allows interested parties to get the relevant information in one  single repository, identify the advisory that should be prioritised in their specific case,  etc.  • CSAF Advisory Editing System. The tool has been developed by the BSI and is made  available to vendors to ensure that they can create and upload advisories on CSAF in  the future.  The BSI also strongly advocates for the establishment of a software bill of materials, at least for  the most critical vendors.  GERMANY – Advisories and bulletins92  According to the German Federal Office for Information Security, an advisory  (short bulk of information concerning the vulnerability) shall contain the following  information.  • Title or identifier of the advisory (e.g. systematically and consecutively numbered).  • Date of publication.  • Affected products, versions and configurations.  92 Federal Office for Information Security (2012), Recommendation: IT-producers – Vulnerability Handling –  Recommendations for software vendors, October.

If an advisory is updated, the additional or modified sections should be clearly  marked as an update. An advisory should not include any information that  allows technically skilled experts to exploit the vulnerability.  Awareness-Raising Campaigns  All consulted Member States expressed the intention of carrying out awareness-raising  campaigns on CVD, especially if the implementation of a national CVD policy will be  mandated. In terms of specific activities, the Member States mostly mentioned the following.  Publish guidelines to assist the involved entities on their respective roles, and guide the code  owners and researchers on how to handle the CVD process (e.g. guide companies that are  reluctant in accepting vulnerability reports or guide researchers on how to act if the vendors do  not replay);  Organise discussion fora to involve representatives of the cybersecurity community, relevant  state institutions, or Critical Entities Operators. In these communities, experts (programmers,  researchers, etc.) can gather and exchange relevant information or good practices. This helps  foster a favourable ecosystem for CVD. These communities are also used to train and manage  the expectations of partners during the CVD process;  Participate in international communities (e.g. the CERT network or the NIS Cooperation  Group), considered particularly valuable to discuss, among others, good practices, present draft  policies or analyse the criticality of specific vulnerabilities with a cross-border impact.  Acquire broad media coverage to raise awareness on particularly disruptive vulnerability  cases.  Examples of awareness-raising campaigns  In Hungary, cybersecurity awareness campaigns are carried out mainly using social media and  participation in awareness-raising campaigns at university educational fairs, and through e- learning courses for the NCSC HU sectoral constituency.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  52  The National Cybersecurity Centre of Lithuania holds quarterly events – the Cybersec  Breakfast – where presentations and discussions on different matters are carried out for about  200 representatives of public sector institutions. Some presentations on the CVD process have  been organised in this context. Similar presentations have been held in the context of the ‘Safer  Internet’ event.  In the Netherlands, there are several good practices in place in terms of awareness-raising  campaigns. Hack right is an awareness programme that addresses specifically young first  offenders (below 23 years old) and helps them understand their rights and duties. The  programme was established in 2019 after it was noticed that most cases arriving in court  involved young researchers. NCSC NL published a guideline on CVD policies, which has been  helpful for organisations implementing CVD. Besides, researchers in the Netherlands have  created the DIVD.NL a platform to report vulnerabilities, supported by volunteers, where they  established their code of conduct. DIVD.NL had, for example, an active role in the Kaseya case:  DIVD has been in a CVD process with Kaseya, who was working on a patch. Some of these  vulnerabilities were used during an attack performed by REvil. Kaseya and DIVD collaborated to  limit the damage wherever possible.  Operational and Crisis Management Activities  For most countries, there are no dedicated practices for dealing with CVD, and the same  procedures that the CERT adopts in the event of crisis management are applied.  In terms of operational or crisis management activities practices, most Member States referred  to the establishment of channels to share information about cybersecurity (incidents,  vulnerabilities, etc.). These channels usually include early warning systems where the contact  details of people operating in critical infrastructures are collected so that they can be contacted  in case of an emergency. For reporting from third parties that are not critical operators, the  Member States argued that due diligence should be guaranteed in contacting the relevant  person in the organisation (security officers, technical team, etc.). In any case, technical details  should never be sent to a generic email address. In some cases, specific sectoral information  groups are established.  For a limited number of countries (2), voluntary information sharing is also promoted at the  level of CERTs. According to some Member States, limited voluntary information sharing is due,  among others, to the sensitivity of vulnerability information. To foster voluntary information  sharing, the level of trust of critical operators should be enhanced (e.g. by ensuring  anonymisation of the information).  Some challenges have also been underlined by the Member States in terms of operational and  crisis management activities. According to consulted countries, from a crisis management point  of view, it is unlikely that the national CERT will receive a long-term heads-up about these  vulnerabilities, nor will it receive all the relevant information ahead of time. In this respect, the  problem with information sharing is that, on a global scale, it is very challenging to ensure that  every critical operator using a certain software gets the patch without any information being  leaked. In this context, what can be done is to inform the whole supply chain through a heads- up notice stating that something will be happening soon, so that all relevant parties are aware  that a process has started, without sharing all the details of the process.  Additionally, small countries have highlighted that the process of building capabilities in the field  of information security, incident handling and crisis management is still ongoing. As such, the  CERT’s capacities are in some cases still limited.  Examples of operational and crisis management activities  The Estonian national CERT is in contact with the service providers who are alerted each time  a vulnerability is found. The information on the vulnerability is also shared by the CERT with the  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  53  Analysis and Prevention Department which is responsible for establishing the connection  between the technical and the strategic levels. The Analysis and Prevention Department is in  charge of drafting a memo on the discovered vulnerabilities and circulating it within the Ministry.  Based on the level of criticality of the vulnerability, the Ministry decides whether to inform the  Cabinet. The Analysis and Prevention Department, hence, helps in the interpretation of the  technical details to make them understandable at the policy level. This mechanism is regarded  as an established best practice.  3.2 CVD POLICY – GOOD PRACTICES  After having assessed the status of implementation of CVD policies across the Member States,  good practices were collected in terms of national policies related to the processes they have  employed.  Firstly, internationally there are two ISO/IEC standards on CVDP: ISO/IEC 2914741 and  ISO/IEC 3011142. The first describes the procedure for disclosing a vulnerability, while the  second deals with the processing procedures for the reported vulnerability. The  ISO/IEC 3011142 also distinguishes between the different stages of the CVD process  (discovery, reporting, validation and triage, remediation, public awareness, deployment). These  two standards describe a complete model with the different aspects of a CVDP93. Besides, the  standard ISO/IEC 27005 on security risk management is also linked with the CVD process  insofar as, according to Clause 11 on ‘Information security risk communication and  consultation’, information security risks need to be communicated between responsible  individuals and stakeholders. A risk communication plan should be developed by the  organisation for both normal operations and emergency situations. The outcome of all this  should be a continual understanding of the organisation’s information security risk management  process and results.  Content of a CVD Policy  A series of good practices can be implemented when drafting a CVD policy. This Section  reports the most relevant.  Firstly, the policy must be implemented by individuals or bodies that can validly represent the  responsible organisation and should be adequately advertised. Its content should be easily  accessible to potential participants, preferably from the website of the responsible organisation.  A disclosure policy helps to define how the vendor will deal with the reported vulnerabilities. As  such, the scope of the policy – which sites, products, devices, services, systems or networks  are concerned – should be clearly defined. The CVD policy should be applicable to the vendors’  various IT systems and to their contractual commitments (suppliers, clients, subcontractors,  staff, etc.). If this is not the case, the policy must explicitly list third parties’ systems that are  excluded from the scope.  The policy should also contain a description of the mutual obligations of the involved parties.  Authorisation to access the computer system  The very existence of a CVD policy or a bug bounty program should imply that authorisation to  access the computer system has been granted to the participant. The coordinated vulnerability  disclosure policy will include provisions which, depending on their exact wording, may be  considered as explicit or tacit authorisations. As such, the vendor should point out that  researchers will not be sued if they stick to the ground rules laid out by the vendor.  93 Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (2020), Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies Part I – Good practices.  Available at: https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide20CVDP20part20I20Good20practices.pdf  https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide20CVDP20part20I20Good20practices.pdf  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  54  According to the German Federal Office for Information Security, in order not to scare  researchers, the vendor should not demand formal or legal agreements such as contracts, a  formal memorandum of understanding or a non-disclosure agreement. Vendors must, however,  state in the policy the conditions under which participants may or may not access the computer  system. The authorisation to modify or delete IT data depends on the way in which the  coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy has been drawn up.  According to the CCB, it is good practice to prohibit participants from using DDoS attacks or  social engineering attacks, compromising the system, and persistently maintaining access to it,  installing malware or viruses, stealing passwords, using brute force to gain access to systems,  sharing the vulnerability with third parties, etc. The policy should also explicitly exclude any  deliberate attempt to intercept, record or become aware of communications that are not  accessible to the public.  More generally, participants must commit to complying with the principle of proportionality, i.e.  not to exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is strictly necessary to demonstrate the security  problem. Participants should also commit not to keep the collected data of the responsible  organisation, including any personal data, longer than necessary.  Whenever these conditions are met and participants are complying with the terms of the policy,  the vendor should pledge to carry out its coordinated disclosure policy in good faith and not  pursue civil or criminal action against them.  Information required to report a vulnerability  A CVD policy must clearly state what information the participant must provide when reporting a  vulnerability. A clear and detailed description of the vulnerability shall be provided by the  security researcher together with clear and detailed information of how the vulnerability has  been discovered (actions taken, tools used). The objective is to be able to reproduce it. If  applicable, the participant should also report any relevant information such as proof of the  existence of the vulnerability (screenshot, link, etc.) and information about the moment the  vulnerability was discovered.  Confidentiality  ‘Coordinated’ means that a vulnerability is reported confidentially. As such, one of the essential  elements of a coordinated disclosure policy is respect for confidentiality: participants should  not share the information collected with third parties or disseminate it without the express  consent of the responsible organisation.  Procedural deadlines  Clear deadlines shall be set in the policy for each stage of the procedure. As soon as the report  has been received, vendors should send acknowledgements of receipt. During the process, the  participant should be kept informed with follow-up on the stage of the handling and  management processes.  To the extent possible, a deadline for fixing the vulnerability should be established. Ideally, the  solution should be developed within 90 days at the latest. However, such deadlines should  remain relatively flexible, depending on the complexity of the vulnerability, the number of  systems affected, the urgency or the seriousness of the situation.  Communication channels  Another pivotal aspect of a CVD policy relates to the point of contact to which the information  should be sent. A specific email address – such as vulnerabilitypolicy@organisation.com – can  be used for this purpose. Notably, common addresses such as info@company.com should not  be used for security-related issues.  mailto:vulnerabilitypolicy@organisation.com mailto:info@company.com  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  55  According to the CCB, the use of an online form is a practical way to receive information about  discovered vulnerabilities. This method has the advantage that the input and processing of data  and the sending of an acknowledgement of receipt can be done automatically.  According to the German Federal Office for Information Security, the vendor’s website shall  offer security-related information at a central position. Such security-related information should  contain the following.  • Vulnerability information (advisories on vulnerabilities not fixed yet, information  regarding possible workarounds and bulletins on vulnerabilities for which security  updates are available).  • Contact information specific for the security of products (email, phone including  services hours, public PGP keys and ‘IdenTrust Secure Email’ certificates of the  company to enable confidential communication on security issues).  • The company’s disclosure policy.  • Patches and updates.  • Supplemental documents (white papers, FAQ, etc.) regarding the secure usage of  products.  • A contact form allows the vendor to structure the information flow and to make certain  information mandatory. In addition, such a form supports the alternative to report  vulnerabilities anonymously. The company should decide if such a form is relatively  simple or more complex.  These webpages shall be protected using valid and verifiable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)  certificates to guarantee the authenticity and confidentiality of the information provided.  Reward to the security researchers  Offering a reward or public recognition could make the CVD policy more attractive for the  participants. Rewards could account for monetary compensation in case a bug bounty program  is in place. Bug bounty platforms operate as a marketplace intermediary. Vulnerability owners  can use a web interface to rapidly design a public or private bug bounty policy and publish it on  the platform. The rewards may even be purely symbolic.  Non-monetary rewards, credits and acknowledgements can be particularly appreciated and act  as an incentive for the security researchers. For example, the Netherlands rewards researchers  with a humorous T-shirt marked ‘I hacked the Dutch government and all I got was this lousy T- shirt’. Similarly, many organisations include researchers in a ‘hall of fame’ published on the  organisation website.  Possible public disclosure  Any disclosure of a vulnerability should be coordinated and synchronised between the parties to  allow the responsible organisation to resolve the vulnerability and to inform affected parties in  advance. Indeed, when a vulnerability is identified in a program, component, protocol, etc.  provided by a third-party, the responsible organisation shall notify them directly before any  public disclosure.  The same applies when the vulnerability threatens to affect other organisations using similar  technology, or in the cases in which the responsible organisation has provided other  organisations with the vulnerable component/components. In these cases, it is essential that a  report on the vulnerability and its resolution is provided to the parties concerned. In the case of  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  56  public disclosure, the vulnerability report and the solution should be published at the  same time.  The responsible organisation must envisage various means to inform its users, for example,  automatic system updates, the publication of security notices on its website or mailings with a  link to a specific internet page.  Established Good Practices in Member States CVD  Procedures  Besides the content of a CVD policy, the disclosure of vulnerabilities entails a series of  procedures that should be implemented for the policy to be effective. This Section provides a  brief overview of the procedures that should be envisaged in a CVD policy. Besides, it provides  an outline of the procedures in place in three Member States – Belgium, Lithuania, and the  Netherlands – considered among the most virtuous examples across the EU.  Overall, the objective of the disclosure policy is to enable the development and deployment of a  solution to remove the vulnerability from the IT system. After the researcher finds and reports  the vulnerability, unless legally or contractually obliged to do so, the responsible organisation  remains free to choose to develop and implement a solution. As mentioned, ideally, the solution  should be developed within 90 calendar days. While such deadlines should remain relatively  flexible, it is important to keep them to the strict minimum, especially if users of the affected  systems are at risk or if there are risks to the protection of personal data. If the organisation is  unable to solve the problem immediately, the IT system concerned should be taken completely  out of service temporarily. The supply chain and the multiple interdependencies between  information systems can complicate the time needed to develop a solution and deploy it.  During this phase, the responsible organisation must, on one hand, perform positive tests to  verify that the solution is working properly and, on the other hand, negative tests to ensure that  the solution does not disrupt the proper functioning of other existing functionalities (94). If the  solution is ready and the vulnerability would affect other organisations, it should be  communicated to the CVD coordinator as a matter of priority and before any public disclosure.  The responsible organisation should respect a reasonable period from this transmission before  a possible general disclosure to users, to allow operators of vital interest to implement the  solution as a priority. If one of the parties does not respond, the parties can always call upon the  designated coordinator, in general, the national CERT or the National Cybersecurity Centre.  Belgium  The procedures established by the CCB can be regarded as a good practice in the EU. Figure 5  and Figure 6 provide a detailed description of the different phases of the CVD process under the  CCB.  94 Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (2020), Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies Part I: Good Practices.  Available at: https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  57  Figure 3 – CCB CVD process (I)  Source: Centre for Cyber Security Belgium  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  58  Figure 4 – CCB CVD process (II)  Source: Centre for Cyber Security Belgium  Lithuania  The National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania has also put in place procedures that could  serve as a basis for the drafting of best practices at the EU level.  According to the centre’s policy, if the researcher decides to report the vulnerability to the  National Cybersecurity Centre – or the vulnerability owner does not reply to the researcher – the  cybersecurity centre carries out its evaluation of the vulnerability, informs the vulnerability  owner, and obliges the vulnerability owner to evaluate the vulnerability and prepare a  vulnerability remediation plan. If the researcher decides to report directly to the vulnerability  owner, there is no coordination involved (unless the vendor fails in responding to the  researcher’s request). In both cases, the researcher needs to act according to the rules  established in the law and share information about the research process he has conducted.  Private entities’ policies can envisage less severe requirements than those established in the  national law (even no requirements at all). Notably, private entities cannot establish stricter  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  59  requirements than those envisaged at the national level. In the case of multiparty disclosure, the  National Cybersecurity Centre is in charge of contacting all the interested parties that are  affected by the same vulnerabilities.  According to the National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania, given the reluctance of  vulnerability owners to respond to researchers, the involvement of the National Cybersecurity  Centre as a mediator in the process is particularly helpful, although as a more mature CVD  ecosystem will unfold, the involvement of the National Cybersecurity Centre in the process  could be reduced (see Figure 7).  Figure 5 – National Cyber Security Centre of Lithuania CVD process – Role of  the coordinator  The Netherlands  The Netherlands is perceived as having established one of the most effective CVD processes in  the EU.  According to them, the most important success factor for the Netherlands has been the bottom- up approach that was followed to set up the current CVD process. The process started with  major banks and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the country feeling the urgency to  accommodate ethical hackers in finding vulnerabilities. The country noticed that if companies,  institutions or organisations are not faithful to individuals reporting vulnerabilities, it is difficult to  force them to implement/adopt a CVD system. Hence, rather than requiring companies to  establish a CVD policy (top-down approach), it is much more fruitful to stimulate an ecosystem  in which researchers/hackers know they are safeguarded judicially and that they are  acknowledged by society. At the same time, companies and organisations know that the rights  and duties of researchers have borders, as they are not allowed to abuse vulnerabilities for  whatever reason.  Other countries have highlighted a series of procedures that they have implemented that should  be regarded as best practices.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  60  • Talk to the vendor. Normally, vendors need to have processes in place for rolling out  the patches for the discovered vulnerabilities following the normal software update  cycle. Cooperating extensively with internal and external product experts also helps to  understand the product’s vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities details.  • Become familiar with the ethical hackers’ community and properly value its work, for  example by establishing bug bounty programs. In this respect, it has been argued by  some Member States that the informal CVD recognition program does not provide the  right incentives to be effective. Overall, it is important to manage the researchers’  expectations by clarifying which type of incentives/rewards they can receive.  • Isolate the information that is received by the researcher and the information that is  sent to the companies. Once an agreement between the two parties is established the  communication can occur independently from the coordinator.  • Implement the OECD’s good practices within the national strategy.  • Adopt the CSAF95 to reduce the time between patch release and patch application.  • Base the CVD policy on international standards such as ISO 29147 and 30111.  • Provide CVD stakeholders with a ‘Vulnerability Disclosure Toolkit’96 as operated by  NCSC UK since September 2021. This guide is dedicated to all organisations willing to  set in place a vulnerability disclosure process and governance. The document refers to  three main CVD aspects: Communication, Policy and Security.  3.3 CHALLENGES AND ISSUES  This Section presents an overview of challenges and issues related to the definition of  coordinated vulnerability disclosure policies in the EU. Legal, economic, policy and technical  challenges are addressed. During the interviews with Member States, to assess the challenges  that Member States face in setting out a CVD policy, they were asked to comparatively evaluate  to what extent the following challenges impede the establishment of a CVD policy in their  countries.  • Legal barriers. Security researchers face significant legal risk.  • Lack of cooperation amongst stakeholders.  • Government ambiguity concerning vulnerability exploitation. Government looking for /  stockpiling vulnerabilities to exploit as part of their law enforcement, intelligence and  national security activities.  • Limited market incentives. Incentives for security researchers to participate in  coordinated vulnerability disclosure programmes.  • Financial and human resources challenges. Lack of resources and skills, and costs of  implementation and operation.  Figure 8 shows that legal barriers and the lack of cooperation amongst stakeholders represent  the greatest challenges. 84 % of Member States (16) believe that legal barriers have a strong or  at least some impact in the process. Similarly, 89 % of Member States (17) consider the lack of  cooperation among stakeholders to either strongly or somewhat impede the establishment of a  CVD policy.  95 OASIS (2017), CSAF Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) Version 1.2.

According  to the OECD, legal challenges ‘are enabled by an overall legal environment that does not  sufficiently protect security researchers and by the behaviour of many vulnerability owners  threatening security researchers with legal proceedings when receiving reports’98.  There are several areas of legal challenges researchers can face.  • Criminal law. According to the Cybercrime Convention, intentionally accessing a  computer system without rights is a criminal offence. Since the cybercrime directive  (2013/49/EU) sets minimum protections, the Member States can adopt stricter rules.  • Copyright law. Researchers can breach copyright law when the information disclosed  entails portions of copyrighted code. The vulnerability owners can establish  exemptions, enabling the possibility of safe harbours.  • Data protection law. Researchers discovering vulnerabilities may access personal data  which could be interpreted as a breach of data protection law. Most vulnerability deals  with personal data, interest in reporting versus interest in data protection can clash.  • Contract Law. Bug bounty policies and in some cases vulnerability disclosure policies  represent the terms of a contract between the vulnerability owner and the researcher.  Breaching the terms of the contract entails legal liability and risks for the researcher,  • Export control legislation and regulation are often cited as a legal risk for researchers  as they may apply to tools and knowledge used to discover vulnerabilities.  As shown in Figure 10, the great majority (17) of Member States consulted consider criminal law  to be the most pressing legal challenge, followed by data protection law.  97 ENISA (2016), ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2016 – 15 top cyber threats and trends.

According to the existing legal provisions in place in most cases, anyone who  finds and discloses a vulnerability by scanning a system without prior authorisation is bound by  criminal law and other legislative clauses.  Both in the cases in which the researchers were actively searching for vulnerabilities and in the  cases in which vulnerabilities are found by accident during the normal use of a system, the  researcher might inadvertently gain access to critical data he was not supposed to gain access  to. In this context, disclosing vulnerabilities without prior authorisation is, hence, not allowed.  Notably, these are distinct cases from accesses where consent is granted in the form of pen  testing arrangements between parties.  But what is the link between finding vulnerabilities and criminal law? According to CEPS (2018),  from a criminal law perspective there are two questions relevant for the process of finding  vulnerabilities as opposed to reporting them. The first one is ‘a substantive one and concerns  the circumstances under which finding vulnerabilities may be associated with a criminal offence,  that of illegal access to information system’;the second one is ‘procedural and relates to the  conditions that need to be met for any crimes associated with finding vulnerabilities to be  prosecuted’99.  Regarding the first question, Article 2 of the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  (the Budapest Convention) mentions what should be meant by illegal access to an information  system when it states ‘Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be  necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed  intentionally, the access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right’. According  to CEPS (2018), this means that there are four conditions that need to be met for illegal access  to apply under the cybercrime convention: the person should have accessed the system  intentionally; that person should have actually had access to the computer system; that access  99 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G. (2018) ‘Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe: Technology, policies and  legal challenges – Report of a CEPS Task Force’, CEPS Task Force Reports, 28 June 2018, p. 42. Available at:  https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/software-vulnerability-disclosure-europe-technology-policies-and-legal-challenges/  https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/software-vulnerability-disclosure-europe-technology-policies-and-legal-challenges/  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  64  should concern either the whole or part of the computer system; and that person should have no  right to access the system’100.  Directive 2013/40/EU of 12 August 2013 (the cybercrime directive) reflects the Budapest  Convention and states that ‘when committed intentionally, the access without right, to the whole  or to any part of an information system, is punishable as a criminal offense were committed by  infringing a security measure’.  Therefore, as stated also by the OECD (2021), according to the Budapest Convention only  the unauthorised access should be considered as criminal offence. It follows that computer  system owners can authorise access through the publication of a vulnerability disclosure policy,  allowing for the protection of security researchers (a limited liability waiver).  When it comes to the second question – the procedural one – related to the conditions that  need to be met for any crimes associated with finding vulnerabilities to be prosecuted, several  countries mentioned during the interview that the interpretation of the intentions of the  researchers by the prosecutor should make it possible to adequately guarantee a level of legal  protection for the researchers.  The Netherlands is the most renowned case in Europe, where researchers are protected  based on a formalised prosecutorial discretion within defined boundaries. The prosecutor in a  case examines three aspects/questions: is the researcher acting in the interest of society? Are  the means used by the researcher proportional? Is the subsidiarity principle fulfilled (were there  other means to accomplish the same goal)? For example, brute-force attacks or entering a  system and waiting a long time to report the vulnerability are deemed criminal. If one of these  three aspects is not fulfilled, then it is expected that the judicial system will prosecute the  researcher.  Similarly, according to the Hungarian case-law, there is judicial discretion to decide whether the  ‘ethical’ hacking (in the lack of contractual basis) is dangerous to society or not. If it turns out  that the committed activity was not dangerous to society – therefore not a crime – the  perpetrator cannot be punished. Of course, in these cases, the court also takes further  conditions into consideration (e.g. the intent of the suspect and other factors).  Furthermore, the CCB has played an important role in clarifying in its CVD policy the  interpretation of how the current criminal law can be applied in a way that would allow for the  CVD process to take place and, similar to the Netherlands, the public prosecutor has clarified  the interpretation of the law.  Likewise, according to the BSI, a CVD policy can be drafted and published based on the legal  foundation already in place in a country. Criminal law only mandates the researcher to behave  in a certain way (‘to play by the rules’). The BSI’s CVD policy incorporates this principle by  establishing boundaries to the researcher’s behaviour. Aspects related to the level of detail of  the reporting could be critical (e.g. a researcher is required to not disclose some information that  might be useful for the public), nonetheless, legal challenges do not overall impede the  establishment of a CVD policy. Once the vulnerability is processed, there are no legal  hindrances to the process. To incentivise reporting without the fear of legal proceedings, the BSI  enables the possibility of anonymity via an ad hoc form on its website. Overall, even if reporting  to the BSI is not free of any legal consequence, the court always takes into consideration the  good intent of the vulnerability finder. Following a published CVD policy could be considered as  an indicator of good intent.  100 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G. (2018) ‘Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe: Technology, policies and  legal challenges – Report of a CEPS Task Force’, CEPS Task Force Reports, 28 June 2018, p. 43  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  65  The Ministry of Justice of Denmark has made a similar evaluation. According to this  evaluation, publishing a CVD policy is regarded as a statement from the vulnerability owner that  it will not pursue a legal proceeding if the security researcher acts within the framework of the  published policy. It is a limited liability waiver. In the event that there is a disagreement  among the parties, the decision is ultimately made by the court.  Therefore, considering the answers to both questions, the approach followed by some countries  in the EU of establishing a CVD policy without the amendment of the penal dode is coherent  with the Budapest Convention and could be considered sufficient to offer a safe harbour to  security researchers.  However, it is important to mention that since criminal law is a prerogative of Member States  and the cybercrime directive, as a piece of EU legislation, it affords only a minimum level of  protection. The interpretation of what constitutes illegal access varies among Member States.  Therefore, as mentioned by some other Member States, although the Budapest Convention  establishes that only unauthorised access to systems is prohibited – and as such, having in  place a CVD policy might be sufficient to guarantee some level of protection for the researchers  even without amending the legal framework – establishing a CVD mechanism needs to be  grounded on more specific criminal law rules concerning the discovery of vulnerabilities.  In particular, the legal framework needs to specify which cases would count as unauthorised  access. Hence, while organisations might authorise researchers to access their system and  prevent researchers from being legally prosecuted, to ensure trust in the CVD process,  guarantees at the institutional level should be established. As such, to promote a national CVD  policy the government must proceed with the necessary legal fundamentals.  Furthermore, there are also several Member States (8) that strongly advocate for an  amendment of the penal code in place in their countries or have already proceeded with  amending the criminal code.  In Lithuania, for example, before the implementation of the law on cybersecurity, the  researchers’ activities were considered a violation of criminal law. As such, the main purpose of  the law has been precisely to create a safe harbour for the ethical hackers to operate whenever  they act in line with the established obligations. The principles for the establishment of this safe  harbour and the rules of behaviour that the researchers have to respect have been taken up  also by the Prosecutor General’s Office and police department.  Analogously, while the French law does not provide immunity to criminal law or such in this  context for researchers, it envisages two protective legal frameworks that can account for partial  protection of the security researcher:  Article L 2321-5 of the French defence code provides a protected alert framework to the French  national cybersecurity authority when discovering a vulnerability. This authority does not have to  refer such alerts to Justice if some conditions are respected.  A whistleblower framework also exists (art 6 à 16 de la Loi No 2016-1691) but it is  more about ‘incidents’ than vulnerabilities.  Greece does not have the type of judicial exemptions described but means to establish one.  The country does have a constitutional provision (Article 16 Constitution of Greece) which deals  with the freedom of academic expression. This provision, while it cannot be interpreted as  granting a right to violate the existing criminal law, it is a basis upon which academics and  scientists are currently being protected in the execution of their duties. As mentioned, however,  Article 16 does not preclude the application of criminal law. There are also legal clauses related  to intellectual property rights that allow for a degree of flexibility when, for example, a protected  document is copied for academic or scientific research. The Greek system has, thus,  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  66  recognised the importance of academic expression, although the parameters for allowing  unauthorised access to systems for research purposes are yet to be defined.  According to Portugal, one of the main ideas when adopting a CVD policy will be to establish a  safe harbour for researchers (non-criminalisation of the researchers’ activities) when they  demonstrate good intentions. The national policy itself will be a framework that can be used to  check on the intentions of the researchers as it provides a series of indications on the steps that  researchers should follow to properly report a vulnerability. Besides, the researchers’ intentions  can be assessed by looking at the logs in the system where the vulnerability is found (e.g. which  kind of tools and techniques the researcher used to find the vulnerability).  In the context of the discussion on the impact of criminal law challenges, the Member States  have been asked whether national or EU jurisdictions address the protection of security  researchers and if they plan on establishing or have established legal immunity (through  criminal law exemptions, for instance) or judicial or prosecutorial discretion, based on an ex  post, case-by-case assessment.  Most of the consulted Member States (11) do not plan on establishing legal immunity by  amending the criminal code, hence the introduction of criminal law exemptions. In some  cases (6), as mentioned, Member States do not consider it necessary to amend the criminal  code because the protection of the researchers is / will be based on judicial discretion.  In some other cases, the Member States do not plan on amending the criminal law due to the  opposition that was faced in the past from the national governments and the state police. Given  that this represented one of the main stumbling blocks, countries are proceeding with the  implementation of a voluntary policy or including CVD in the cybersecurity strategy and raising  awareness on the topic. Very likely, they will move forward with amending the criminal law if the  provision of the NIS2 directive, which suggests that Member States adopt cybersecurity  strategies that include CVD policies, will create the right context to do so.  Data protection law  According to several responding countries, the data protection law is also relevant, as it requires  the balancing of the rights for the protection of personal data when somebody identifies a  vulnerability in a system’s database with the effectiveness of the research activities.  However, under some legal frameworks, such as the Belgian one, if you have a clear privacy  statement and the data protection law is respected, establishing a CVD policy would not be  challenging. Notably, the relationship between the vulnerability owner and the researcher could  be seen as a subcontract: the ethical hacker could be seen as the processor of the personal  data in the event that personal data is found during its activities according to the GDPR aspects  of the CVD policy. If the policy is not clear enough on the privacy aspects, the researcher could  be seen as a data controller. Overall, the researcher is dealing with any sort of data and the  most important aspect is the confidentiality of the process 101.  Other legal challenges  According to some countries, if you have a traditional kind of product (running on a user’s  computer), contract law is also an impactful legal challenge. Very often, researchers must  contact cross-border vendors (usually in the United States). These products include licensing  rules stating that all the disputes concerning the product are handled according to US law.  However, United States contract law might contain provisions stipulating that all reverse  engineering is prohibited (including the type of testing employed for finding vulnerabilities).  Similarly, the DMCA could lead to legal liabilities and risks for the researcher. Researchers  101 According to some experts, this idea should be further evaluated since the controller-processor relationship must be  bilaterally agreed and put in writing. Therefore, a policy would not be enough of a waiver for data protection law.  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  67  testing products under the EU’s customer protection law have different legal obligations, and  this leaves room for interpretation and uncertainty. This is one of the reasons why CERTs  intervene in these cases and report the vulnerability on the behalf of the researcher so that the  researcher will not have to face the legal burden. Additionally, national software companies  might include in the contractual obligations with the third party purchasing their product the  prohibition to perform CVD.  Cross-border dependencies also create additional legal barriers. While in recent years there has  been a greater degree of cooperation between the Member States, this could be handled more  efficiently. Establishing contacts in different universities and private companies around EU have  been proven to be useful, but the most effective way to enhance the cooperation between the  Member States in case of cross-border dependencies would be to improve the single-point-of- contact system established with the NIS directive.  Economic challenges  As acknowledged in the Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure report by ENISA102, economic  factors play an important role in the development of vulnerability disclosure policies. While quite  often information security is regarded only as a technical issue, the underlying factors that  characterise the persistency of vulnerabilities in hardware and software are only partially related  to the nature of vulnerabilities themselves, since to a great extent come from the economic  aspects of information security and its market dynamics.  Today, many ICT products are embedded with software and hardware and can connect to  networks. Besides the very recent attention from policymakers directed towards these products,  it is important to mention that while in some sectors, such as aeronautics, manufacturers have  been ahead of regulation in considering cybersecurity in their production processes103, the  software industry has, for instance, strongly opposed assuming liability for its products over the  last 50 years, as the car industry did for the first 70 years of its existence. This approach is  generated by economic incentives that, according to some researchers, can be as detrimental  for security as bad technical design104. This approach from the software industry has its own  rationality. In a market in which network economics apply, exploiting the ‘first-mover’ advantage  requires being first to market even if the product is not perfect (‘we’ll ship it on Tuesday and get  it right by version 3.0’)105. However, it is clear that this approach values cost-effectiveness,  usability and time to market over security. Indeed, using security-by-design guidelines and  updating software rise costs increase time to market and make products less user friendly with  negative effects on the product demand. Therefore, a rational behaviour from a company  conflicts with the optimal level of security. This misalignment of incentives while in a competitive  market in general does not exist, in a market with network economics106 it is becoming the norm.  Furthermore, even if the alignment of incentives is correct, the market could fail to deliver  optimal levels of security given to information asymmetries and negative externalities.  Examining the ICT products market, market failures are generated from one side by information  asymmetries – the customer does not have a clear and neutral idea of the level of security of  102 ENISA (2018), Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure, December 2018.

Therefore, the outcome of these markets is quite often that ‘the  winner takes all’ (see Varian, R. and Shapiro, C. (1999), Information Rules – A strategic guide to the network economy,  Harvard Business School Press, Boston MA, United States).  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/economics-of-vulnerability-disclosure https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/roles-and-responsibilities-of-actors-for-digital-security_3206c421-en https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/roles-and-responsibilities-of-actors-for-digital-security_3206c421-en https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221355448_Information_Security_Economics_-_and_Beyond https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3941712_Why_Information_Security_is_Hard-An_Economic_Perspective  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  68  the product – and from the other side by negative externalities – software producers are not  accountable for the damages created by the exploitation of vulnerabilities in their products.  There is also an additional factor that needs to be considered: the changing nature of the  information security market. The information security market of today is very different from  yesterday’s market. Today, with software and hardware embedded everywhere and always  being used by almost everybody, the vulnerability surface is increasingly dramatically. At the  same time, many companies that have not traditionally had a relevant presence in the ICT  sector, such as automotive or white goods producers, are starting to develop products with  integrated software and hardware components and, therefore, need to familiarise themselves  with secure development and information security and understand how to implement  vulnerability disclosure policies – a complete new domain that requires a technical and  organisational maturity unknown to them until very recently107.  Therefore, according to ENISA (2018), ‘the changing nature of the information security market  also has consequences for the economics of vulnerability disclosure, how vulnerability  disclosure is carried out, and how actors behave in the vulnerability disclosure process’108. It will  increase vulnerability complexity and the number of vulnerabilities that will require multi-vendor  coordination. Since the vulnerability disclosure process is characterised by the action of multiple  economic agents, quite often with conflicting interests, it will become increasingly important  to use regulations or incentive mechanisms to mitigate or eliminate the aforementioned  negative market outcomes.  Incentives can take a financial or a not financial form. Monetary rewards for finders from bug  bounty programmes are the most common financial incentives. Non-financial incentives have ad  hoc characteristics that inspire a behaviour not directly connected to monetary rewards. This is  the case of finding vulnerabilities for the technical challenge it offers, for the prestige that this  action entails (some companies create a ‘hall of fame’ for security researchers that find  vulnerabilities) or for ethical or ideological reasons.  During the interviews with Member States, (as shown in 53Figure 9), several (9) suggested that  limited market incentives for security researchers to participate in coordinated vulnerability  disclosure programmes have a strong impact on the establishment of a CVD policy in the  EU.  Furthermore, vendors do not have incentives to offer secure products. Indeed, while consumers  can understand the usability and price of a product, they are unable to assess its level of  security. This can generate adverse selection: since customers are unable to distinguish more  secure products from less secure products, developers offering more secure products will not  be rewarded since customers will not be willing to pay for it.  It should also be noted that most security researchers are activists, not professionals since  professional researchers usually would rather work for private companies. This is due, among  other reasons, to the limited market incentives that are in place now in terms of (economic)  rewards that are provided to researchers, for example through bug bounty programmes.  Furthermore, most Member States (13) regard the lack of resources and skills to implement  coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy as being particularly impactful. This challenge  impacts vendors, as they might not be able to build secure products, but also makes it harder to  find the vulnerabilities as researchers are not numerous. The adoption of CVD processes can  be challenging for coordinators as well (i.e. national CERTs or national cybersecurity  107  ENISA (2018), Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure, December 2018, p. 24. Available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/economics-of-vulnerability-disclosure  108 ENISA (2018), Economics of Vulnerability Disclosure, December 2018, p. 24.

Indeed, in the case of a highly technical vulnerability found in a specific sector (e.g.  aviation sector), the national CERT might lack the required skills and capabilities. As such, the  trust of the parties in the ability of the national CERT to handle the vulnerability is undermined.  Hence, the lack of resources and skills applies to and affects all stakeholders.  On the other hand, the costs of implementation and operation have been regarded as  relatively less impactful. According to the CCB ‘setting up costs of a coordinated vulnerability  disclosure policy are more budget-friendly than having external companies perform audits. After  all, the reward for a bug bounty programme is the result of a commitment on the part of the  participant to achieve a certain result, whereas an external auditor is usually only bound by a  commitment of means. The latter must therefore be compensated for all their activities, even if  they have not found any vulnerabilities or only minor vulnerabilities at the end of their  investigation.’109  An additional economic challenge to effective vulnerability treatment is the lack of cooperation  among stakeholders. Most of the Member States interviewed (17) consider that the lack of  cooperation among stakeholders either strongly or somewhat impedes the establishment  of a CVD policy. All consulted Member States consider addressing the lack of  coordination between vulnerability owners and researchers as more challenging than  addressing the lack of coordination at the level of CSIRTs.  In this context, the most critical issue is that researchers see the vulnerabilities as more severe  than the vulnerability owner, and the timeline for disclosure set by the owners as too lax.  Additionally, challenges in the coordination exist due to the lack of preparation of the  vulnerability owners on how to handle vulnerability reports. To give an example, one Member  State mentioned that some years ago several researchers were using an open bug bounty  platform to contact vulnerability owners. However, the contacts that were on the platform were  often incorrect or the reports would end up in the spam folder of the vendors’ email inboxes.  This problem has been overcome thanks to the intermediation of the national CERT. As time  went by, indeed, researchers started to include the CERT as an email recipient when contacting  the vendors.  On the other hand, it has been argued that at the level of national CSIRTs, vulnerability  disclosure mostly stays within the perimeter of the CSIRT itself. Besides, even when a non-EU  country is involved and coordination would be needed, the level of coordination among CSIRTs  is already quite well established via communication channels for incident response.  Finally, considering the role of the government in taking action to address the grey market for  code vulnerabilities as an economic chalenge, it is interesting to notice that no consulted  Member States consider addressing the grey market as a priority. Indeed, it has been argued  that the government could outlaw the selling of vulnerabilities to foreign agencies, but it might be  very challenging to address researchers’ selling of vulnerabilities on the grey market.  Political challenges  In this Section the challenges related to the development of the vulnerability disclosure process  and the roles and dynamics of the different stakeholders will be assessed.  Top down or bottom-up approach?  One of the issues raised during the analysis of the status of play of the EU experience on CVD  policies and the interviews with Member States is the different dynamics followed in developing  CVD policies, namely a bottom-up v a top-down approach. The Netherlands consider having  109 Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (2020), Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policies Part I: Good  Practices. Available at: https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  https://ccb.belgium.be/sites/default/files/Guide%20CVDP%20part%20I%20Good%20pratices.pdf  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  70  followed a bottom-up approach as the most important success factor for their CVD policy. The  process started with the major banks and ISPs in the country feeling the urgency to  accommodate ethical hackers in finding vulnerabilities. The country noticed that if companies,  institutions or organisations are not faithful to individuals reporting vulnerabilities, it is difficult to  force them to implement/adopt a CVD system. Hence, rather than imposing companies to  establish a CVD policy (top-down approach), it is much more fruitful to stimulate an ecosystem  in which researchers/hackers know that they are safeguarded judicially and that they are  acknowledged by society. At the same time, companies and organisations know that the rights  and duties of researchers have limits, as they are not allowed to abuse vulnerabilities for  whatever reason. Some other Member States, such as France, are instead in favour of  developing a more centralised approach.  The role of government  The Member States have been consulted concerning the role that government can/should play  to ease the establishment of a national CVD policy. As shown in Figure 11, among the  proposed actions, most of the Member States (13) consider updating imperfect  cybercrime and intellectual property frameworks to better protect security researchers,  for example through ‘safe harbours’, as the most important action governments could  carry out. Changing criminal law will be, however, only one step in the process. Indeed, a safe  harbour could be established for well-intentioned researchers accessing a system without  authorisation, but this will not cover all the different offences/violations that could occur in the  process. As such, this action should be accompanied by other actions aimed at fostering an  overall trusted environment for CVD.  More generally, all actions that government could carry out to lead by example in the  establishment of a CVD policy (i.e. adapting CVD within the government; adapting vulnerability  handling and management within the government; including vulnerability management and  handling and CVD in regulation, standards and guidance, or using them as indicators of  compliance) are regarded as essential. Governments should lead by example, especially in  economies where there are numerous vendors and a great variety in the level of acceptance of  the vulnerability reports and in the value attributed to secure products. In this context, first  convincing public entities to adopt CVD and reassuring them that the reports will be handled is  considered as important.  National non-legislative activities (e.g. supporting and enabling CVD practices and promoting  awareness-raising campaigns) have also been particularly appreciated by several Member  States (12).  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  71  Figure 9 – Role of government  The role of the private sector  Different approaches can be distinguished when a CVD policy is established at the level of  private companies or at the governmental level. Companies enjoy a degree of flexibility when  adopting a CVD policy, and they can do so irrespective of a CVD policy being adopted at the  governmental level.  For their part, companies need mainly to use existing documents and apply them in a flexible  manner to implement the necessary processes, develop a policy and publish it on the  company’s website. Establishing a policy at the governmental level entails instead fostering an  overall ecosystem in which vulnerabilities are accepted and acknowledged. As such, CVD policy  at the governmental level may introduce or enhance a third-party coordinator (e.g. CSIRT),  should foster awareness-raising activities, support the legal sector in identifying possibilities and  mitigate the legal challenges (e.g. prosecution or liability of the security researchers) with regard  to coordinated responsible disclosure.  These two processes are clearly related since establishing a policy at the governmental level  might increase the chances of private companies implementing policies at their individual level  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  72  and security researchers engaging in finding vulnerabilities. This, as mentioned above, should  not necessarily take the form of an obligation from the government to private entities but can  entail stimulating a societal environment in which security researchers are safeguarded judicially  and are acknowledged by society.  This being said, when it comes to the role of the private sector in developing vulnerability  disclosure policies, there are different views among the Member States. As illustrated the  Figure 12, consulted Member States are divided on whether the private sector or the  government should lead the process or not.  Figure 10 – Role of the private sector  According to some Member States, companies should not wait for a government  legislative/policy intervention, especially because establishing a CVD policy at the company  level is already possible within some of the existing national legal frameworks. Therefore, the  private sector could take the lead in implementing coordinated vulnerability disclosure by  defining and publishing on the companies’ website public reporting mechanisms on  vulnerabilities disclosure according to the ISO standards and best practices. Furthermore, some  Member States mentioned that one of the most important aspects for the private sector to take  the lead in is the establishment of bug bounty programmes, as they help in fighting the  vulnerability taboo.  Besides, according to a consulted Member State, in many cases researchers have found that  the private sector is more appropriately positioned for dealing with vulnerability disclosure rather  than state-sector entities. Indeed, in some cases state entities have limited resources and  capabilities to deal with CVD, especially because the resources allocated for national security  can be scarce. On the other hand, there are large companies that have well-established policies  and disclose them publicly. In this context, it should be noted that CVD should be considered  necessary only insofar there is insufficient trust between the finder and the industry. As such,  direct disclosure should be promoted.  Moreover, irrespective of a CVD policy being established at the national level, companies will  still have to carry out their verification of the data the researcher has provided them with. In this  context, the role of the coordinator can be questioned. If the role of the CERT in the CVD  process is intended only as a facilitator of the communication between the parties, it could be  beneficial. However, in a CVD process, CERTs can also be empowered with the verification of  the information, and there might be cases in which CERTs are badly equipped to carry out  these activities, further undermining the trust in the process. This is usually the case with highly  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  73  technical vulnerabilities in specialised sectors. As such, mandating national CERTs to undertake  a coordinator role in the CVD process might not be the most appropriate way to go for all  Member States. In some cases, CERTs will be not equipped with adequate resources, nor  would they have the required links with the industries and the researchers’ community. In this  context, the EU should promote industries to take the lead and disclose their vulnerability  management policies along with promoting direct disclosure.  Notably, the process for the establishment of a CVD policy in the Netherlands has been  initiated by the private sector, specifically by banks and ISPs. These companies led by example  and started establishing CVD policies. This allowed for the creation of an ecosystem in the  country in which there is a societal awareness of the usefulness of the CVD process.  In other countries, the private sector also seems willing to take the lead in the CVD process. For  example, Belgium mentioned that while the private sector must increase its overall level of  maturity, the Cybersecurity Coalition110 is considering implementing its cybersecurity policy, and  leads by example. Similarly, in Finland, some vendors such as ICASI are already taking the  lead in establishing CVD policies and industry consortiums, and trying to deal with CVD and  play a role in the development of standards. Notably, Finland considers thatinitiatives at the  level of industry consortium can have a greater impact than initiatives at the company level.  On the other hand, several Member States believe that the example should be given by  the government. Among the arguments that have been provided, the Member States  mentioned that the private sector is constrained by economic considerations. Hence, the  example should be given by the government which can foster a favourable ecosystem for IT  security. The private sector should participate in the discussions with governments and  understand that the final goal of the government is not to regulate private entities but to create a  more secure ecosystem. This can also be fostered by creating communication groups with  representatives of vendors, or communication groups with sector-specific stakeholders.  Establishing safe and reliable communication channels could indeed allow more information  concerning vulnerabilities to be shared between parties.  Besides, in some cases, the capabilities of the private sector are too limited (especially for  SMEs). Implementing a CVD policy without a well-established security researcher network and  a government coordination network could be risky as the companies would not have the  resources and skills to handle the inflow of information, the patching and the disclosure.  Furthermore, if the government takes the lead in the establishment of a national CVD policy,  greater harmonisation of the processes can be assured. As such, having a patchwork of  different incoherent policies can be avoided.  Finally, for some of the smaller countries, the private sector is not expected to take the lead  given the size of the internal market.  In most of these countries’ views, the private sector is in a leading position in establishing bug  bounty programmes. The private sector can also help to develop standards and codes of  conduct defining the practical aspects of a CVD policy. Following a harmonised approach  towards CVD among private organisations also allows benefits to be disseminated more  effectively and market imbalances to be reduced.  110 Partnership between players from the academic world, the public authorities and the private sector with currently more  than 100 key players from across these three sectors as active members  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  74  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  According to CEPS (2018), in May 2018 only two countries had CVD policies in place: the  Netherlands and France. Section 2 of this report shows that there are two other countries that  have recently implemented CVD policies (Belgium and Lithuania), four additional countries are  close to releasing their policies and there are ten other countries where this process is in  progress. These data show that, although the situation on CVD policies in the EU is still  fragmented, the awareness of the need to develop them is growing and that, amid a lack of  legal certainty for security researchers, some countries are still using the current legal  framework or are amending national criminal laws to promote CVD policies in the EU.  In this Section, the challenges previously mentioned will be addressed focusing on the current  best practices in the EU.  4.1 RECOMMENDATIONS ON LEGAL CHALLENGES  It has been mentioned that legal risks faced by security researchers represent a major obstacle  to the development of vulnerability disclosure policies. However, the current practices among  Member States can suggest a modular approach to overcome these challenges.  First, as suggested by the CVD policy implemented by Belgium, since according to the  Budapest Convention only unauthorised access is unlawful, EU countries could implement  CVD policies that will offer a limited liability waiver to security researchers if they comply  with ad hoc requirements such as those of the CVD policy described in the Belgian or also in  the Dutch model of disclosure. According to the CCB, Belgium is a civil-law country and all the  countries that have signed the Budapest Convention could follow their example. A boost in this  direction could be offered by the adoption and transposition of the NIS2 directive, which requires  Member States to design cybersecurity strategies that include ‘policies to promote and facilitate  coordinated vulnerability disclosure …’ 111. Furthermore, according to some Member States  such as the Netherlands, Hungary, Denmark, Germany and Austria, the interpretation of the  intentions of the researchers by the prosecutor should adequately guarantee a level of legal  protection for the researchers.  Second, if national criminal laws put ad hoc limitations on the possibility of offering a liability  waiver to security researchers, Member States could amend their criminal laws to create the  legal certainty and the necessary ‘safe harbour’ for researchers involved in vulnerability  discovery, also recognising ethical hacking. Countries like Lithuania have recently amended  their penal code, countries like Portugal, Greece, Slovenia and Spain are in the process of  doing so.  Third, the EU could amend the cybercrime directive to offer legal certainty to security  researchers involved in vulnerability discovery and to allow for the definition of common rules  and procedures across Member States to allow for a common process of software coordinated  vulnerability disclosure in Europe. Article 3 of the directive could be amended so that Member  States consider the specific case of well-intentioned security researchers in their national  legislation. Such minimal harmonisation could offer security researchers increased protection,  particularly in cross-border situations112.  111 European Commission (2020), NIS2 proposal, p. 35.

This directive applies to reporting persons working in the private or public  sector who acquired information through breaches of EU law in a work-related context. This  directive only protects internal researchers and not external ethical hackers. It is applied to  breaches of the NIS directive or the GDPR and not to all vulnerabilities on an IT system.  However, a general EU approach on this could be limited by the principle of subsidiarity.  An additional action could be for Member States to define the role of ethical hackers.  According to some consulted Member States, an aspect that should be defined before the  establishment of any legal protection for the security researchers is how to distinguish/identify  ‘ethical hackers’ from ‘black hats’ (i.e. researchers aiming at finding vulnerabilities for an illicit  use or bad intentions). In this context, a law could be drafted defining the criteria according to  which a researcher could be considered a professional ethical hacker  (education/publications/experiences, etc.). For instance, the NIS directive transposition in the  Hungarian information security law defines who could be responsible for information security, as  well as what education a security professional must have. This definition might be a useful  example of possible criteria that can be envisaged for establishing a shared definition of ethical  hackers.  Moreover, there is the need to align the EU approach to coordinated vulnerability  disclosure with the existing EU regimes and regulations such as the intellectual property  regime and the GDPR, thus ensuring the protection of intellectual property rights or the  protection of data of stakeholders involved in vulnerability management processes.  Nevertheless, it is recommended to also be mindful about the limitations and blind spots of the  existing frameworks.  Finally, the development of CVD policies could also play an important role in the implementation  of various regulations such as the NIS2 directive and the GDPR. As mentioned previously, the  NIS2 directive proposal mentions in Article 6 the need for Member States to design  cybersecurity strategies that promote the development of CVD policies. Many Members States  mentioned during the interviews the catalyst role that the transposition of the NIS2 directive  could have for the development of CVD policies in the EU and in particular for the impetus that  could provide for amending the national criminal law, offering legal certainty to security  researchers involved in the discovery of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, according to CEPS (2018),  since the GDPR entails that software owners, vendors and tech firms become data controllers  insofar as they process personal data within their systems, if it is assumed that that  irresponsible handling of vulnerabilities could lead to personal data breaches falling within the  scope of GDPR, CVD can be an effective tool to mitigate relevant risks.  To be more precise, ‘When an unpatched vulnerability leads to the breach of personal data  under Article 33 of the GDPR, a data controller may be subject to administrative fines and  potentially other sanctions. In assessing the level of the fines, the authorities will take into  account a number of factors as stipulated in Article 83(2), including the measures taken by  controllers to avoid personal data breaches (e.g. how carefully the vulnerability was handled).  Therefore, if a controller implements a CVD allowing vulnerabilities to be dealt with in a timely  manner, then it may reduce the risk of incurring fines arising from possible personal data  breaches’ (113).  4.2 RECOMMENDATIONS ON ECONOMIC CHALLENGES  During the interviews, several Member States suggested that limited market incentives for  security researchers to participate in coordinated vulnerability disclosure programmes have a  113 Pupillo, L., Ferreira, A. and Varisco, G. (2018) ‘Software Vulnerability Disclosure in Europe: Technology, policies and  legal challenges – Report of a CEPS Task Force’, CEPS Task Force Reports, 28 June 2018, p.55  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  76  strong impact on the establishment of a CVD policy in the EU. Therefore, appropriate  initiatives aimed at encouraging security researchers to actively participate in CVD  programmes need to be promoted by Member States, but also at the EU level – such as  the European Commission’s free and open source software auditing (FOSSA) project114.  In this context, a specific role could be played by bug bounty programmes. Bug bounty  programmes are crowdsourcing initiatives that reward security researchers for finding and  reporting vulnerabilities and represent a more proactive approach to vulnerability discovery by  companies. They operate as a marketplace intermediary between vulnerability owners and  researchers115. Bug bounty programmes can either be public or private. Public programmes  are open to everyone but may nevertheless ban some researchers from taking part based on  their track records. Private programmes are invite-only programmes for selected highly skilled  security researchers.  Many companies have created their own programmes: Microsoft, Mozilla, Kaspersky Lab and  Google run their own bug bounty programmes. In other cases, these programmes are managed  by other companies that use their own platforms and teams of experts, connecting organisations  to a global crowd of trusted security researchers to identify vulnerabilities. This is the case for  companies such as Bug Crowd, Hacker One or YesWeHack in Europe116.  Bug bounty programmes have been discussed during the interviews. Some stakeholders have  engaged in reflections on whether it would make sense for the EU to have its own bug bounty  programme in place. The general feeling is that the EU should not set up a bug bounty  programme. The risk is to face individual governments’ reluctance and requests for  justifications of such initiative, potentially seen as excessively intrusive. Interviewees have  expressed scepticism regarding the entity owning and managing the programme, and the  availability of financial resources to cover for the bounties. Indeed, organisations often  underestimate the cost of launching a bug bounty programme. In addition, some industries and  companies are currently not in favour of bug bounty programmes, as data treated in their  activities may be too sensitive to be handled by external parties, or there is too great a risk of  trade secrets being stolen. These are seen as significant obstacles to the creation of an EU bug  bounty programme. In conclusion, bug bounty programmes work well in some circumstances,  for example, for large companies who have an interest in outsourcing a part of their security  (often because external researchers are less costly than internal employees). Nevertheless, at  this stage the EU should harmonise regulation and practices across the EU Member  States on bug bounty programmes rather than attempting to set up one of their own.  However, incentives to promote CVD policies could also take the form of support to  research programmes to foster CVD policies among public and private researchers in Europe.  like the Framework Programme for Research and Technology Development and in particular  the figital Europe programme and Horizon Europe. Furthermore, the European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre could also finance projects focused on enhancing coordinated vulnerability  disclosure practices in Europe.  Furthermore, since many Member States (13) regard the insufficient resources and skills to  implement coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy as being particularly impactful, it is  114 European Commission (2021), EU-FOSSA2.

When it comes to addressing the lack of coordination between vulnerability owners and  researchers, the role of a trusted third party as a coordinator to facilitate coordination  becomes particularly relevant. This role could be played by CERTs or CSIRTs or other  entities able to facilitate the coordination process. This role could be very helpful in facilitating  the relationship between researchers and vulnerability owners and in managing complex multi- party disclosure when the CVD involves more than two actors117. Furthermore, the coordination  role could be very effective in facilitating relationships among stakeholders across borders.  According to some experts, to approach cross border coordination an international not-for-profit  and well-resourced entity should be created118.  4.3 RECOMMENDATIONS ON POLITICAL CHALLENGES  This Section provides possible guidance on how to approach the political challenges related to  the development of the vulnerability disclosure process, and the roles and dynamics among the  different stakeholders will be assessed.  Top down or bottom-up approach?  One of the issues raised during the analysis of the status of play of the EU experience on CVD  policies and the interview with Member States is the different dynamics followed in developing  CVD policies, namely a bottom-up v a top-down approach. The development of decentralised or  centralised approaches has both pros and cons. For instance, countries such as France, the  United States and China, follow a top-down approach where researchers need to report  vulnerabilities through a government agency. As mentioned in some interviews with the  research community or private sector, researchers may be reluctant to share information with  government agencies in the first place. Furthermore, countries like the Netherlands consider  having followed a bottom-up approach as the most important success factor for their CVD  policy. However, while national policies reflect the different views towards vulnerability  disclosure policies, it is likely that a top-down approach in which the EU suggests a  common model of coordinated vulnerability disclosure at the EU level could work better  and promote coordination at the EU and international levels.  The role of government  Governments can play a key role in the development of CVD policies. According to the Member  States, governments should promote the following actions.  • Updating cybercrime and intellectual property frameworks to better protect security  researchers, for example through ‘safe harbours’.  • Leading by example in the establishment of a CVD policy:  o adapting CVD within the government;  o adapting vulnerability handling and management within the government;  o including vulnerability management and handling and CVD in regulation,  standards and guidance, or using them as indicators of compliance.  Governments should lead by example, especially in economies where there are numerous  vendors, a great variety in the willingness of the vulnerability owner to accept and handle the  vulnerability report and in the value attributed to secure products. In this context, first convincing  117 FIRST (2017), ‘Guidelines and practices for multi-party vulnerability coordination and disclosure’.

Furthermore, governments should also promote national non-legislative activities such as  supporting and enabling CVD practices and/or promoting awareness-raising campaigns.  Finally, governments could promote cooperation across borders and standards by facilitating  the exchange of information on vulnerabilities across borders between vulnerability owners and  security researchers, and encouraging all stakeholders to take part in the development and  enhancement of international standards on CVD policies119.  The role of the private sector  According to some Member States, companies should not wait for a government  legislative/policy intervention, especially because establishing a CVD policy at the company  level is already possible within some of the existing national legal frameworks. Therefore, the  private sector could take the lead in implementing coordinated vulnerability disclosure by  defining and publishing on the companies’ website public reporting mechanisms on  vulnerabilities disclosure according to standards and best practices, such as the ISO/IEC  29147:2018120 or the European Telecommunications Standards Institute’s guide to coordinated  vulnerability disclosure121.  The private sector could also take the lead in putting in place bug bounty programmes as they  help in fighting the vulnerability taboo.  Besides, according to a consulted Member State, in many cases, researchers have found that  the private sector is more appropriately positioned for dealing with vulnerability disclosure than  state sector entities.  4.4 RECOMMENDATIONS ON CHALLENGES FROM  OPERATIONAL AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES  Some challenges in terms of operational and crisis management activities have also been  underlined by the Member States. These challenges could be better managed with stronger  private-public partnerships (PPPs) and better information sharing among companies and  between companies and public authorities. PPPs are very helpful to start building trust among  stakeholders and, with their flexibility in terms of spectrum of mandate and type of participants,  can be very effective for sharing information on vulnerabilities. The presence of public  authorithies in the PPS can further encourage information sharing of vulnerabilities and  actionable intelligence.  4.5 THE ROLE OF ENISA AND OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMISSION  Consulted Member States have proposed several actions that ENISA and the Commission can  adopt to facilitate and support the establishment of CVD policies. Specific measures that would  ease the adoption of CVD in EU include the following.  According to several Member States (8), providing clear guidance to countries on how to  establish a CVD policy, publishing countries’ best practices and challenges, and publishing  templates upon which countries can draft their policies. Publishing best practices would be very  119 OECD (2021), ‘Encouraging Vulnerability Treatement – Overview for policy makers’, OECD Digital Economy Papers,  No 307, OECD Publishing, Paris, France, February’.

The CSIRT Network has been suggested by few countries as a very useful  forum to share best practices.  Promoting awareness-raising campaigns on CVD at the EU level to persuade vendors  across the EU to work on preparing the required interface to be able to handle the researchers’  report.  Foster cooperation and trust. Identifying and supporting initiatives meant to increase trust  between public and private stakeholders are fundamental to improving the vulnerability  management process. Establishing safe and reliable communication channels, for example,  could allow more information concerning vulnerabilities to be shared between parties.  Publishing a webpage where all the regulations in place in the different countries are collected  (a repository of Member States’ CVD initiatives) allows researchers to be more informed on the  level of protection they can receive in the different countries.  Harmonising the CVD initiatives in the different countries and promoting the use of  international standards, such as the MITRE standard for publishing vulnerabilities. Currently,  each Member State will have to establish a CVD policy upon a different national framework.  Once every country has a CVD policy in place, EU institutions can work on the harmonisation of  the different frameworks.  Encourage the establishment of bug bounty programmes at the EU level for open software  or core modules of critical infrastructures. Notably, in 2017 the EU had already established a  bug bounty programme to 15 open source software used by the European institutions, giving  awards of up to 25 000 EUR. The programme was a component of the EU-founded EU- FOSSA2122 project. The EU could built on this experience and encourage the establishment of  bug bounty programmes at the EU level.  Addressing Member States’ resource constraints that hamper the implementation of CVD  policies by fostering an ecosystem where it is economically rewarding to make secure IT  systems. This can be achieved, for example, by implementing a regulation to establish  mandatory ICT security, which could create a business case for companies to revive the ICT  market.  Including procurement rules for ICT products. Procurement policies at the EU level could be  a great market driver for vendors to produce more secure products.  Establish an easy-to-use interface for entities to report vulnerabilities, similar to the CERT/CC  web-based platform VINCE. This will encourage and enable fast vulnerability reporting and  remove potential delays from the chain of reporting.  Suggesting or mandating to Member States to define a clear separation between what  should be considered a breach of criminal law and what should not before the transposition of  122 European Commission (2021), EU-FOSSA2.

This is particularly pivotal for countries where the criminal code is more difficult to  change123.  Establishing a CVD policy at the EU level. The CERT EU or other EU bodies/agencies could  undertake the role of CVD coordinator, easing the communications between researchers and  companies involved without them having to engage with multiple national CERTs. Establishing a  CVD policy at the EU level could also help to address some fundamental questions about  liability implications (e.g. on the gathering of personal data or infringement of copyright rules).  Initiating and promoting a broader dialogue on vulnerability handling and management at  the EU level, not just on CVD. The NIS Cooperation Group could more significantly foster the  conversation on these topics. Indeed, it is not apparent that such discussions have taken place  between the Member States.  123 Italy is proposing an amendment to the NIS2 directive text, aiming at facilitating the definition of this separation. Italy is  proposing to add the following statements to Article 6 (1.a) NIS2: ‘Member States may provide for specific requirements to  make the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure mechanism consistent and compliant with their national legal frameworks. In  particular, they may define the conditions according to which the identification and disclosure of vulnerabilities would not  entail a breach of Criminal Law.’  COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICIES IN THE EU  April 2022  81  5.

Established in 2004 and  strengthened by the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT products, services and  processes with cybersecurity certification schemes, cooperates with Member States and EU  bodies, and helps Europe prepare for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through  knowledge sharing, capacity building and awareness raising, the agency works together  with its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to boost the  resilience of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep Europe’s society and  citizens digitally secure.

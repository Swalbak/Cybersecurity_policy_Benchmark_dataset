For better readability by avoiding repetition of abbreviations a couple of synonyms will  be used, depending on the context (i.e. ‘ICS-CERC services’ to depict those services, ‘ICS  responsibility’ to point to the overall mandate of a CERT in that context, etc.).  Executive summary  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are indispensable for a number of industrial processes, including  energy distribution, water treatment, transportation, chemical, government, defence and food  processes. Though until a few decades ago ICS functioned in discrete environments, nowadays they  tend to be connected to the Internet. This enables streamlining and automation of industrial  processes, but carries with it the risk of exposure to cyber-attacks. The ICS are lucrative targets for  intruders like criminal groups, foreign intelligence, phishers, spammers or terrorists. Therefore, the  ability to respond to and mitigate the impact of ICS incidents is crucial for protecting critical  information infrastructure and enhancing cyber-security on a national, European and global level.  This document is an initial attempt to provide a good practice guide for the entities that have been  tasked to provide ICS Computer Emergency Response Capabilities (ICS-CERC). On the other hand,  this guide does not have the ambition to prescribe to the EU Member States which entities should  be entrusted with provision of ICS-CERC services.  This document builds upon the current practice of CERTs with responsibilities for ICS networks, and  also on the earlier work of ENISA on a baseline capabilities scheme for national/ governmental (n/g)  CERTs1. Consequently, it employs a similar approach in addressing the topics relevant for ICS-CERC  provision, by using four categories of baseline capabilities: mandate, service portfolio and operations  in relation to ICS-CERC and, last but not least, cooperation with the other ICS stakeholders. These  four categories of capabilities are mutually interdependent.  In the chapter on mandate capabilities the guide delves into formal processes for the establishment  of ICS-CERC. It mentions factors that need to be taken into account when building ICS-CERC rather  than building response capabilities for ‘ordinary’ ICT systems. The guide also addresses the  advantages and disadvantages of concrete types of the mandate: ICS sector-specific, national,  regional and global. It defines the constituencies for ICS-CERC and offers a variety of international  sources of inspiration for the mandate and other formal aspects of ICS-CERC.  Operational capabilities (technical) focus on actual ICS-CERC services to be provided, especially in  the main phases of the incident management cycle. The guide also briefly touches upon the question  of how to maintain, develop and improve ICS-CERC once it has been established.  The chapter on operational capabilities (organisational) deals with operational aspects required for  the provision of ICS-CERC services and also with dedicated personnel and their qualifications. The  guide highlights the importance of training and further education for the staff responsible for ICS- CERC and also raises the topic of a suitable hosting organisation for ICS-CERC.  The chapter on co-operational capabilities summarises the main reasons for on-going cooperation  between CERTs providing ICS-CERC services and other ICS stakeholders. In this context, the  peculiarities of both national cooperation (with ICS providers, vendors or CERTs in the country) and  1  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems  Computer Emergency Response Capabilities considerations for ICS  October 2013  Page  iv  cross-border cooperation (international initiatives in the area of ICS protection like CIGRE, ESCoRTS,  IEEE and others) are discussed.  Wherever appropriate, examples of current practices related to handling ICS incidents are  presented. However, it should be noted that established CERTs in Europe still have very limited  experience in and contact with ICS-CERC services. For these reasons, this guide needs to be  considered a living document, which will need to be updated in accordance with wider deployment  of ICS-CERC in Europe. ENISA is ready to provide support to the teams responsible for the provision  of ICS-CERC services. It already provides online training material for the CERTs relating to attacks on  critical information infrastructure (scenario 13 of CERT training material2).  2  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems  Computer Emergency Response Capabilities considerations for ICS  October 2013  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Aim and scope of the document 1  1.2 European policy environment with regard to the ICS-CERC and critical information infrastructure 1  2 Recognised practices for ICS-CERC 4  2.1 Mandate considerations for ICS-CERC 6  2.1.1 Industrial Control Systems versus Information Communications Technology 6  2.1.2 Obtaining a Mandate 7  2.1.3 Span of Mandate 9  2.1.4 Defining the Mandate's Constituency 10  2.1.5 Seeking Input for Mandate 11  2.1.6 Importance of Mandate 12  2.2 ICS Operational Capabilities: Technical Considerations 14  2.2.1 CERT Services to Develop Good Technical Capabilities for ICS 16  2.2.2 Maturity of capabilities and further improvement of operational services 22  2.3 ICS Operational Capabilities: Organizational considerations 24  2.3.1 When to provide services for ICS – which operational mode to choose? 24  2.3.2 Right personnel for the ICS environment 24  2.3.3 Training the personnel for ICS environment 26  2.3.4 Suitable hosting organisation for ICS incident response capabilities 27  2.4 How and why to develop good cooperative incident response capabilities for the ICS sector 29  2.4.1 Importance of cooperation 29  2.4.2 Choosing partners for cooperation at the national level 30  2.4.3 Cooperation at cross-border level 32  3 Conclusions 35  Next steps 37  Page 1  1 Introduction  1.1 Aim and scope of the document  The objective of this guide is to provide good practice to build a Computer Emergency Response  Capabilities for Industrial Control Systems (ICS-CERC). It aims to support those teams that will be  entrusted with the provision of ICS-CERC in the EU Member States, and for the governments that  consider assigning a mandate for ICS-CERC to a team. The aim of the guide is not to make  recommendations on which bodies should be responsible for the provision of ICS-CERC. Such a  decision is within the competence of the EU Member States.  The guide builds on the current good practice of CERTs that are tasked with dealing with ICS security  incidents and on earlier work of ENISA in defining baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs.3 The four  categories of baseline capabilities (mandate & strategy, services, operation, cooperation) defined  previously by ENISA to describe a properly functioning CERT are, with some adjustments, the basis of  this document. Section 2, the core of the guide, examines in detail the four categories of baseline  capabilities required for the establishment and effective provision of ICS-CERC services.  Subject matter stakeholders were consulted. A number of CERTs in Europe and worldwide were  asked to respond to a survey on aspects of the above-mentioned four baseline capabilities in the  area of ICS protection. Several subsequent interviews were conducted with the representatives of  the crucial stakeholders: CERTs, ICS asset owners and vendors. The main and most interesting ideas  and opinions of these stakeholders are highlighted throughout the document.  1.2 European policy environment with regard to ICS-CERC and Critical  Information Infrastructure  Industrial control systems often constitute Critical Information Infrastructures (CII).4 The EU and its  Member States are aware of the increased exposure of ICS to outside malicious attacks. At the  European level the EU Member States are working on countermeasures to protect CII.5 An important  step was the adoption of the Directive on European Critical Infrastructures6 in 2008. The Directive  established a procedure for identifying and designating European Critical Infrastructures (ECI)7 and a  common approach for assessing the need to improve their protection. However; the Directive has a  rather sectorial scope, and refers only to the energy and transport sectors. In 2012, the Directive  3  ENISA, Baseline Capabilities for National/ Governmental CERTs (2009); Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of  National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report, 2012.  4  Critical information infrastructure was defined in a Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection, COM (2005) 576 final, as ‘including those physical resources, services,  and information technology facilities, networks and infrastructure assets which, if disrupted or destroyed,  would have a serious impact on the health, safety, security or economic well-being of Citizens or the effective  functioning of governments’.  5  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/policy-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-ciip  6  http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/jl0013_en.htm  7  Critical infrastructure was defined in a Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection, COM(2005) 576 final, as ‘including those physical resources, services, and  information technology facilities, networks and infrastructure assets which, if disrupted or destroyed, would  have a serious impact on the health, safety, security or economic well-being of Citizens or the effective  functioning of governments’.  Page 2  was comprehensively reviewed.8 As a result, the scope of the Directive may be extended in the  future to other sectors that rely heavily on CII and ICS.  There have been a number of initiatives by European institutions dealing with the topic of CII  Protection (CIIP). In 2009 the European Commission adopted a Communication on Critical  Information Infrastructure protection (CIIP).9 The Communication included an action plan for both  the EU Member States governments and the private sector. It was based on five pillars: (i)  preparedness and prevention, (ii) detection and response, (iii) mitigation and recovery, (iv)  international cooperation and (v) criteria for European Critical Infrastructures in the field of ICT.  Two years later another communication was published on the results achieved in meeting the  objectives of the action plan: Communication on CIIP on ‘Achievements and next steps: towards  global cyber-security’.10 The European Commission took stock of the results achieved so far and  announced follow-up actions. This Communication concluded that purely national approaches to  tackling security and resilience challenges are not sufficient, and that Europe should continue its  efforts to build a coherent and cooperative approach across the EU.  In its Conclusions on CIIP11 of 27 May 2011, the Council of the European Union stressed, among  other things, the need to foster cooperation among Member States by developing incident  cooperation mechanisms between them. In addition two ministerial conferences on CIIP were held:  in 2009 (Tallinn, Estonia)12 and in 2011 (Balatonfüred, Hungary).13 In Tallinn, the debate (‘Tallinn  process’) started on the general direction of the European efforts towards an increased network and  information security for CIIP. The conference in Balatonfüred aimed to take stock of progress made  and lessons learned (reflected in the above-mentioned Council conclusions). It also discussed ways  to engage all relevant stakeholders and in particular the private sector.  In 2012, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the European Commission's  Communication on CIIP on ‘Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security’.14 The  resolution included recommendations that have subsequently been incorporated into the EU Cyber  Security Strategy and into the accompanying proposal for a Directive on network and information  security.15 The EU Cyber Security Strategy explicitly mentions that the Commission and EU Member  States will ‘increase policy coordination and information sharing through the international Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection networks such as the Meridian network,16 cooperation among  competent authorities for network and information security and others’.  8  See a working document of the European Commission: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-  affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  9  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  10  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0163:FIN:EN:PDF  11 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/sede/dv/sede150611cccybersecurity_/se  de150611cccybersecurity_en.pdf  12  http://www.mkm.ee/eu-ministerial-conference-in-estonia-initialized-tallinn-process-to-secure-critical- information-infrastructure/  13  http://www.newspusher.com/EN/post/1302809161-2/EN-/telecom-ministerial-conference-on-ciip- balatonfured.html  14  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2012- 0237&language=EN&ring=A7-2012-0167  15  http://www.eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/  16  http://www.meridian2007.org/Default.aspx  Page 3  In this strategy the European Commission asks ENISA to:   Assist the EU Member States in developing strong national cyber resilience capabilities,  notably by building expertise on security and resilience of industrial control systems,  transport and energy infrastructure;   Examine in 2013 the feasibility of Computer Security Incident Response Team(s) for  Industrial Control Systems (ICS-CSIRTs) for the EU (the task that lead to the development of  this guide).17  The overall EU policy on CIIP has resulted in a number of concrete achievements. As a follow-up to  the Communication on CIIP (see footnote 9), the European Forum for Member States and the  European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience18 were established. In addition, two pan- European cyber exercises (Cyber Europe 201019 and 201220) and one EU–US cyber exercise (Cyber  Atlantic in 201121) have taken place. The objective of these exercises was to trigger communication  and collaboration between EU Member States when responding to large-scale attacks affecting CII.  In 2010 ENISA published a minimum set of baseline capabilities and related policy recommendations  for National/ Governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) to function effectively.  In 2012, ENISA took stock of the progress made and updated policy recommendations.22  In recent years ENISA has researched several issues related to CIIP, with an emphasis on improving  the protection and resilience of ICS. In December 2011, it published a report ‘Protecting Industrial  Control Systems: Recommendations for Europe and Member States’,23 with extensive analysis of  the ICS protection in Europe and beyond. It also includes ICS security standards and guidelines  (Annex III) as well as a list of initiatives in ICS security (Annex IV).  EU Member States have also made progress in adopting national cyber-security and CIIP strategies.  Usually, the national cyber-security strategy deals with CIIP issues,24 while a separate strategy is less  common. Germany is an example of a Member State that has both a ‘general’ cyber security strategy  and a strategy on CIIP.25  17  This task is in fact analogous to earlier work by ENISA in the area of baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs  18  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ep3r  19  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber- europe/ce2010/ce2010report  20  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-europe/cyber- europe-2012/cyber-europe-2012-key-findings-report-1  21  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-atlantic/cyber- atlantic-2011  22  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  23  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems  24  ENISA maintains a selection of national cyber-security strategies at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national- cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world.  25  http://www.bmi.bund.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/598732/publicationFile/34423/kritis_englisch.pdf  Page 4  2 Recognised practices for ICS-CERC  As ICSs become increasingly interconnected and thus more vulnerable to and a greater target of  cyber-attacks,26  it is also becoming more important that ICS computer emergency response  capability (ICS-CERC) is in place to counter these threats. ICS-CERC can be developed and offered by  many different entities, including CERTs, governmental organisations, non-governmental  organisations and private corporations. Incident handling is a core ICS capability that must be  provided by any such actor, but the specific nature of the ICS cyber-security arena means that teams  with ICS-CERC will often also serve other functions such as sharing and distributing information  about ICS cyber-security incidents or collecting statistics about ICS incidents.  The challenges in developing these capabilities have many similarities to those faced in the broader  ICT environment, but also key differences can be observed.27 ICS-CERC have to be built up with those  differences in mind. Still, the overlap between the capabilities needed for responding to ICS cyber- incidents and ICT cyber-incidents means that the experiences and best practices of well-established  CERT teams can serve as a valuable resource for the development of ICS-CERC.  ICS-CERC may require different resources and objectives, but they will have a common need to be  built up based on good common practices from ‘normal’ CERT work.  ICS-CERC can be built up based on four main elements as explained below, which are in line with the  baseline capabilities scheme28:  Table 1: Elements of ICS-CERC  Element Description  (1) Formal Capabilities  (Mandate, role and  responsibilities)  Covers the necessary processes and procedures concerning the functions,  roles and responsibilities of actors as the ICS-CERC is being developed,  what the mandate should include, how long the mandate should last, and  why a mandate is important and needed.  (2) Operational  Capabilities – Technical  Concerns the services and activities that an entity with ICS-CERC  responsibilities should develop, the follow-up steps to developing these  services, the investment required in terms of time and resources, and  specifically how to develop incident response capabilities.  (3) Operational  Capabilities –  Organisational  Includes a working regime for entities providing ICS-CERC, developing the  necessary internal expertise for ICS cyber-security, and training  programmes and policies.  (4) Cooperation and  Capabilities  Addresses stakeholders which the entities providing ICS-CERC should seek  to cooperate with as the capability is being established and thereafter;  describes why cooperation is necessary, and how to approach potential  partners.  26  It is important to note that even systems that are not connected to external networks can be targets of  attack.  27  By ICT environment, this document is referring to computers, computer networks, and other  communications systems, but without a specific focus such as industrial control systems.  28  ENISA, Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs (2009); Deployment of Baseline Capabilities  of National /Governmental CERTs: Status Report, 2012  Page 5  Figure 1: Four main groups of CERC capabilities in ICS  Overview of Development of  ICS-CERC  Formal capability  Operational capability: technical  Operational capability: organisational  Cooperation capability  Source of ICS-CERC Responsibilities  ICS-CERC team  Page 6  2.1 Mandate considerations for ICS-CERC  A mandate for building ICS-CERC must clearly and fully cover functions, roles and responsibilities  that fall under the four groups of ICS-CERC depicted in Figure 1. A mandate should take the nature of  ICS cyber-incidents into account while respecting and ideally complementing a country's existing  cyber-security structures and legislation.  2.1.1 Industrial Control Systems versus Information Communications Technology  ICS and ICT cyber-incidents can have different characteristics that should be taken into account as  ICS-CERC services are being developed. As a fundamental matter, system performance (availability),  confidentiality and data integrity are generally regarded as primary goals in the ICT world. Human  and environmental safety are major considerations for ICS cyber-security providers due to the  nature of the processes being controlled, although system availability and data and system integrity  are also important.29  Furthermore, while cyber-attacks on both industrial control systems and ICT infrastructures can have  significant and damaging consequences, industrial control systems are commonly associated with  specific critical infrastructure sectors. The EC's 2008 Directive on European Critical Infrastructures  establishes a procedure for identifying and designating European Critical Infrastructures and an  approach for improving their protection.30 As a result, ICS cyber-security can become more critical  given the potential of many ICS cyber-security incidents to have a major impact outside of the ICT  domain; for example, a cyber-attack on a power plant's control systems could cause a number of  possible safety and health issues, whereas an ICT cyber-attack would be less likely to cause such  issues (although it may do so depending on the sector attacked).  ICS responsibilities should be developed taking into account a number of factors that can distinguish  ICS cyber-security efforts from traditional CERT capabilities, although it should be recognised that  cyber-attacks on ICT can also cause significant harm and require development of robust capabilities:  Table 2: Distinguishing characteristics of providing ICS-CERC31  Distinguishing Characteristic Example  Impact on supply chains, broader  economy;  ICS cyber-attacks are more likely to cause significant damage  due to the nature of the sectors where control systems are  found. For example, a cyber-attack that takes an electrical  power station offline, even for a limited amount of time, could  29  See Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Recommendations of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce, 2011 (available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-82/SP800-82-final.pdf)  30  See Directive on European Critical Infrastructures, 2008 (available at http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:345:0075:0082:EN:PDF)  31  See Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Recommendations of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce, 2011 (available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-82/SP800-82-final.pdf)  CERT respondent: \"The very fact that the incident affects ICS and critical information  infrastructure makes the incident severe and attaches high priority to its handling.\"  Page 7  cause significant economic damage and create the potential for  injury and/or loss of life.  Challenge of building ICS  expertise and knowledge  Developing ICS-CERC requires attention to specific devices,  protocols, and network infrastructures that may not be  required for traditional CERTs. Further, cyber-security issues  impacting control systems are more likely than broader ICT  cyber-security issues to affect a specific sector, which makes it  more challenging for ICS stakeholders to build up expertise and  knowledge.  Challenge of finding qualified ICS  employees  The fact that ICS cyber-security is often tied to a specific sector  of CII can make it more challenging to find suitable and  experienced staff for CERTs providing protection of ICS-CERC  than for traditional CERTs, which are based more on general  principles and skills.  ICS can involve extremely  sensitive information  The sensitivity of information pertaining to ICS can make  vendors and other ICS stakeholders less willing to share  information about ICS cyber-security incidents, which in turn  can make it more challenging to provide ICS-CERC services.  ICS cyber-security infrastructure  is less developed than for ICT  There have been significant efforts to develop best practices  across the ICT sector, ranging from transnational efforts such as  FIRST to regional efforts such as Trusted Introducer or ENISA to  national-level national / governmental CERTs. A number of  organisations which are dedicated to improving ICT cyber- security exist, including sector-specific groups and ICS players  such as US ICS-CERT, but such efforts are not as common or are  in the early stages when it comes to ICS-CERC.  The process for building up ICS-CERC must take these factors into account, and these factors serve as  the basis for managing a mandate.  2.1.2 Obtaining a mandate  A mandate should provide the basis for understanding what a team's responsibilities are when it  comes to ICS-CERC. Having a clear mandate is fundamental for providers of ICS-CERC to gain the  trust of constituents and other ICS stakeholders. This is particularly important in the ICS context for  establishing the necessary levels of public-private cooperation (e.g., overcoming ICS vendors'  hesitancy to share information with providers of ICS-CERC services due to their concerns about legal  liability for improperly disclosing information).  A number of factors must be taken into account while creating a proper mandate:  CERT respondent: \"Despite bearing a lot of similarities with traditional IT systems, there  are special ICS features … relating to a) network infrastructure; b) protocols; [and] c)  devices. Ordinary CERTs do not possess the knowledge of how the infrastructures of ICS  networks are organised, or how the protocols and devices work.\"  Page 8   A country's current cyber-security strategy (develop ICS-CERC in line with this)   The mandate of the country's national / governmental CERT (develop the mandate  advantageous to the development of ICS-CERC)   Other existing regulations and communications regarding CIIP (proceed in line with  European and national legislation in this area)   The scope of mandates for teams already exercising ICS-CERC (learn from existing examples  both in and outside Europe)   The views of ICS stakeholders who will be part of the constituency regarding the scope of  the mandate (engage these players while defining the mandate)  Consideration of the above-mentioned factors should help to ensure that an ICS-CERC mandate  matches the needs of the constituency and the ICS community as a whole, and helps the CERT  providing ISC-CERC services to establish and gain trust and legitimacy with both its constituency and  other relevant institutions such as its government and the CERT community.  As mentioned before: ICS is a specific area with unique challenges, and it will be not easy for ICS- CERC to be developed in a way that meets the expectations of the organisations responsible for their  development, of government, and of constituents. This suggests that ICS-CERC in a team should be  developed with simplicity and directness in mind (“start small, think big”).  Figure 2: ICS-CERC mandate considerations  Unfortunately, there are relatively few existing teams providing ICS-CERC services with publicly  available mandates for use as a reference. ICS-CERT in the United States is one prominent example  of a CERT that has been established to handle ICS cyber-security issues and has taken the lead in  publishing best practices related to developing ICS-CERC.  A number of European CERT organisations have (to some extent) developed ICS-CERC and provide  ICS cyber-security services to their constituents, including:   CERT-FI (Finland),32 which has an informal mandate in the area of industrial control systems  cyber-security issues, and is hosted by FICORA, the Finnish national regulatory authority;   Danish govCERT (Denmark),33 which also has an informal mandate in the area of ICS cyber- security issues as an n/g CERT;  32  See http://www.ficora.fi/en/  • Expectations •Resources • Formal Processes and Mandate  Government / Host  Organisation  ConstituencyTeam Responsible for ICS- CERC  •Uncertainty about Scope (Roles  and Responsibilities) • Lack of Trust • Lack of Recognition of Capabilities  Page 9   Federal Office for Information Security (Germany),34 which has a formal mandate in the  area of ICS cyber-security granted to it by the German Parliament.   CERT-PT (Portugal),35 which provides some ICS-CERC services to its constituency despite  having no formal mandate.  2.1.3 Range of the mandate  The range of the mandate for CERTs with ICS responsibilities also needs to be determined is the  focus global, pan-European, regional, national or sectorial? ICS-CERC can be valuable at any of these  levels. Each type of range has advantages and disadvantages:  Table 3: Potential range of ICS-CERC mandates  Range Advantages Disadvantages  Sectorial Capabilities will serve sector-specific  ICS stakeholders, and can easily  develop into a forum for sharing of  information and best practices given  the constituency's common interests.  Can be more challenging to manage  without a geographic component to  the range; ICS stakeholders from  different countries face different  regulatory and legal environments;  linguistic challenges can also arise.  National ICS players from the same country  will face common regulatory and legal  environments; the focus on a single  market makes it easier to focus on  what types of ICS-CERC need to be  developed.  ICS players might have little in  common and little reason to  cooperate besides sharing a common  country; a national span makes it  more important that the right entity  is providing ICS-CERC to avoid political  and other wrangling.  Regional / Pan- European  ICS-CERC with a regional focus can  create synergies and facilitate  information sharing across EU  Member States; this can be positive  for providing training, harnessing  greater resources and providing  services such as the gathering of  statistics. The experience of  institutions such as ENISA can also be  leveraged to good effect. Further,  private providers (companies)  offering services in this area typically  operate across borders in different  countries, so cross-border incident  management could be easier to  implement from a practical  perspective.  Regional-level CERTs with ICS  responsibilities face challenges from  different legal and governmental  systems, which can make cooperation  harder to achieve; ICS players might  be more hesitant about sharing  information in regional forums than in  a national forum where there is clear  responsibility for information  security. Further, national  governments often exert authority  over CII, which can make it more  challenging to establish effective  regional or pan-European incident  response capabilities for the ICS  cyber-security arena.  Global Global-level mandates for CERTs with Global-level mandates can create  33  See http://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/CFCSDocuments/rfc2350_govcert.pdf  34  See https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN  35  See http://www.cert.pt  Page 10  ICSCERC responsibilities can create  synergies, facilitate the sharing of  good practices and information across  the widest possible group of ICS  stakeholders, and in principle offer  access to greater resources, although  obtaining those resources may still be  challenging.  issues associated with regulatory and  legal frameworks CERC. Furthermore  national governments often exert  authority over CII, which can make it  more challenging to establish  effective global incident response  capabilities for the ICS cyber-security  arena.  European CERT teams surveyed for the purpose of this document expressed a slight preference for  mandate ranges of either national or sectorial level:  Figure 3: Preferred range for ICS-CERC, survey results  Number of answers=6 (Q: What is the optimal range of ICS-CERC?) (Graph shows results from survey asking  European CERT actors with ICS-CERC responsibilities what in their opinion is the preferable range for a mandate  in the field of ICS-CERC services)  It is worth considering whether dedicated ICS-CERTs should be created at Member State or EU level.  The advantages of these types of state- or EU-level incident response capabilities dedicated to ICS  cyber-security issues are clear: a state- or EU-level mandate would provide the chance for an  organisation to develop ICS-CERC at a high level and establish a national-level (or higher)  constituency. Available resources are a consideration for whether it makes sense to provide a  mandate for developing ICS-CERC at these levels; if resources are limited, it may not be easy to  argue persuasively for separating out a dedicated ICS-CERT instead of positioning it within a Member  State or EU-level body with existing (traditional) CERT capabilities.  2.1.4 Defining the constituency  The constituency is the overall customer base to which a team with ICS incident response  responsibilities provides its services. Ideally, the constituency should be defined as precisely as  possible.  Within the ICS ecosystem, there are a number of types of players which are at the core of ensuring  ICS cyber-security efforts, which should be considered when determining the constituency. A  mandate can require ICS-CERC services to be provided to several types of stakeholders, including:  50%  17%  33%  State  Regional  Sectorial  Page 11   Public ICS stakeholders: ICS-CERC services will be offered to governmental bodies (assets  owners), whether at a national level (e.g. national security) or more localised level (e.g.  operations of specific plants). Generally, public institutions will be more open to  cooperation with teams charged with developing ICS-CERC, and are likely to take a more  cooperative approach. Stakeholders from public sector are at the heart of the ICS cyber- security ecosystem because many sectors with control systems fall within the public sphere  and a government usually has a great interest in protection of its national CII.   Private ICS stakeholders: Private ICS stakeholders play an important role in the broader ICS  cyber-security ecosystem in terms of incident handling. ICS-CERC services will need to be  offered to companies (e.g. assets providers), so teams responsible for CERC providing them  will have to invest more in relationship- and trust-building with these stakeholders, as they  are usually more hesitant to share information or to report ICS cyber-security incidents. In  order to reflect legal obligation for private stakeholders to cooperate with teams with ICS  responsibilities, reporting of incidents needs to be formally defined in the mandate.   ICS vendors: (also part of the private ICS stakeholders, but due to their special role singled  out in the considerations) ICS-CERC services will have to be offered to the companies that  sell, install and maintain industrial control systems. These actors may even have their own  ICS-CERC developed and therefore may be particularly reluctant to cooperate with other  entities offering ICS-CERC services. ICS vendors are especially key constituents for teams  with ICS-CERC responsibilities because of their important roles in terms of providing asset  owners and providers with service-level agreements (SLA), vulnerability patches, updates,  and upgrades of systems.  Teams offering ICS-CERC services may decide to limit them to constituents of a certain sector or to a  particular company's customers. If the scope of a mandate is limited in such a way then it is  important that it covers all the key players (public actors, private actors, ICS vendors) within that  sector. Likewise, care should be taken that a mandate is not too broad as to make the constituency  completely unwieldy. When a mandate covers multiple or all CII sectors, it should be also considered  how to involve all stakeholders from all of these sectors in defining the mandate and considering the  services and role of the team with ICS-CERC. This is particularly challenging due to the different  nature of sectors (for example “energy” and “health”).  2.1.5 Seeking input for mandate  Teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC services need to investigate to third parties for input  regarding their mandates and development of capabilities. As mentioned, there are still very few  organisations offering ICS-CERC services or ICS best practices in comparison to more general, CERC  traditional CERTs, but input from other parties is invaluable.  There are a number of organisations with worldwide, European, national or sectorial scope that  could offer input to a team seeking to develop ICS-CERC services. These include36:   CIGRE: A global organisation dedicated to the exchange of information and best practices  about power stations.37   International Atomic Energy Agency: The IAEA offers meetings and good practices related to  the security of nuclear energy facilities.38  36  For an extensive list of ICS security-related initiatives see the Annex IV of ENISA report ‘Protecting Industrial  Control Systems: Recommendations for Europe and Member States’,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems/annex-iv  37  See http://www.cigre.org/What-is-CIGRE/Activities  Page 12   ENISA: The European Network and Information Security Agency provides a variety of best  practices regarding ICS cyber-security as well as recommendations and good practices for  establishing incident response capabilities in Europe.39   ESCoRTS: The European Network for Security of Control and Real Time Systems aims to  foster progress towards cyber-security of industrial control systems in Europe by assisting  the EU as a whole (e.g. authorities, industry, manufacturers, etc.) in developing informed  positions and in shaping current and future efforts related to control systems security  standardisation.40   European Network for Cyber Security: The ENCS is a cooperative association that creates and  brings together knowledge and resources to secure European critical infrastructures.41 42   ICS-CERT: The US ICS-CERT is widely regarded as the leading dedicated ICS-CERT worldwide,  and offers a variety of resources including good practices and training materials, as well as  significant experience in providing ICS-CERC to its constituency.43   Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure: The United Kingdom's CPNI provides  protective security advice and advice for security planning.44   US Department of Energy: The United States' DoE offers a variety of documents and good  practices for ICS-CERC.45   US Department of Homeland Security: The DHS provides recommended practices with  regard to ICS security and is the host organisation for US ICS-CERT.46   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers: The IEEE produces a significant amount of  literature on engineering-related topics.47  All of these organisations could be sources for teams charged with developing ICS-CERC services as  they try to establish a mandate and promote their CERC services to their constituencies  2.1.6 Importance of mandate  The current practice in Europe is that national / governmental CERTs responsible for providing ICS- CERC services are not given a formal mandate. Instead, they are often provided with a broader  mandate that covers all of their activities (including ICS-CERC services) to the extent that they are  “expected to develop” the capabilities. This may reflect the extent to which ICS-CERC services are  still viewed as just an extension of these n/g CERT teams' core responsibilities, rather than as an area  which requires the development of a separate group of capabilities.48  This approach may work for some teams’ CERC, but it can also create challenges for them if their  CERC mandate is not specific enough to support cooperation between them and their private sector  constituents. This could be especially challenging for teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC  when an existing entity already provides ICS-CERC services. This may occur if an entity plays a larger  role in cyber-security in the country and has also other responsibilities. In particular, mandatory  38  See http://www.iaea.org  39  See http://www.enisa.europa.eu  40  See ESCoRTS, Security Control and Realtime Systems, Survey of Existing Methods, Procedures, and  Guidelines, available at http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/ISSS/Focus/Documents/D21.pdf  41  See https://www.encs.eu/  42  See https://www.encs.eu/  43  See http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/  44  See http://www.cpni.gov.uk/  45  See http://www.doe.gov  46  See http://www.dhs.gov/  47  See http:www.computer.org  48  Analysis based on the survey conducted to provide input into this document.  Page 13  reporting requirements to such entities may conflict with the more voluntary model of cooperation  favoured by teams with ICS-CERC, especially with private actors and ICS vendors.  As discussed previously in this study, the nature of ICS cyber-security threats and the potential  reluctance of private-sector ICS players and vendors to cooperate with teams with ICS-CERC make  establishing a baseline supporting cooperation especially important. Thus, a team charged with  developing ICS-CERC services that does not have a clear mandate may struggle to achieve trust,  legitimacy and cooperation with key ICS stakeholders.  In the longer run, having a formal mandate for ICS-related activities will benefit teams because it will  offer a clear and specific commitment to their responsibilities and how they should interact with the  various ICS stakeholders. In addition, having a formal mandate means having formal legislative and  legal support for the activities of a team with ICS responsibility. In turn, with formal processes in  place that must be respected, ICS-CERC services must be developed within certain guidelines. The  increasing prominence of ICS cyber-security matters will make it more worthwhile to ensure that  teams with ICS responsibilities have a clear mandate for these activities and the necessary support  and tools to carry them out.  Page 14  2.2 ICS operational capabilities: Technical considerations  When building up operational capability, one main challenge is to determine, to which ICS-CERC  services are suitable for the constituency. This decision must be supported by a good understanding  of the constituency size, type of services which could be delivered, resources available, and, last but  not least, the scope of the mandate.  Services provided in the initial stage of such a development of ICS incident response capabilities will  depend on a number of factors, including:   The mandate and mission;   Available resources (human and financial);   Size and scope of the constituency and its needs;   The current services provided by the team outside the ICS constituency (synergies).49  Current practice shows that teams aiming at establishing ICS-CERC services typically provide several  other CERT services as well: reactive services, proactive services, and management services with a  focus on incident handling, vulnerability coordination, raising awareness among constituents, and  training.50  Figure 4: Services portfolio for ICS constituency  Within these categories of services, teams can offer any number of more specific ICS-related  services. For example, US ICS-CERT provides four core areas of functionality to its constituents:  49  Valid only if the CERT is already mandated with building ICS incident response capability.  50  Results of survey of European CERT players carried out in conjunction with this document, asking those with  ICS-CERCs about the specific types of ICS services they offer to their ICS constituencies.  Team with ICS-CERC  Incident Handling Vulnerability  Coordination  Awareness Raising Other Services  Page 15  Figure 5: US ICS-CERT service offering51  In 2013 JP-CERT, which was charged with building ICS incident response responsibilities recently,  provides three ICS-related services: incident handling support, vulnerability coordination and  awareness raising for ICS assets owners.52 The team intends to improve its incident handling  capabilities and is considering providing on-site and off-site services to ICS asset owners in the  future.  Figure 6: JP-CERT ICS service offering53  Interestingly, current practice in Europe shows that teams with ICS-CERC responsibility do not  universally provide either incident response service or vulnerability assessments for ICS, even though  these are generally considered to be core services of any CERT team.54 On the other hand, many of  these teams with ICS-CERC provide more ‘passive’ services such as issuing alerts, incident  coordination, and technology watch. This may reflect strategic decisions by these teams to establish  themselves by first developing their capabilities in easier-to-provide services or it may suggest that  these teams have limited resources (financial and personnel).  51  ICS-CERT Year in Review, 2012, U.S. ICS-CERT, at p. 3  52  See http://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/cs/controlsystemsecurity.html  53  See http://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/cs/controlsystemsecurity.html  54  Analysis based on survey conducted in conjunction with this report  Alerts and Advisories  Incident Response Services  Conducting Technical Analysis of  Malware, etc.  Coordinating, Monitoring  Vulnerabilities  Incident Handling  Services  Vulnerability  Coordination Awareness Raising  Page 16  Figure 7: Services provided by CERT respondents providing ICS services  Number of answers=6  Q: What services, if any, do you provide in relation to ICS?  It is crucial that the teams with ICS responsibilities  decide on offering services only after having  discussed with their constituents (ICS providers/asset owners) and ICS vendors (see also section 2.4  on cooperation). At the moment it is problematic that IT security vendors often have insufficient  understanding of ICS environments when they are trying to sell their products. According to ICS  security experts, vendors often try to apply security designed for protecting data in a traditional ICT  network, which has many aspects not applying to a network of ICS devices. For example, in the ICT  network environment a malware-infected computer is often simply taken off the network. The same  approach in an ICS environment could potentially lead to a catastrophe in a power plant,  manufacturing facility or oil and gas pipeline. Therefore, SLAs must be given a strong priority with  regard to vendors.55  2.2.1 CERT services to develop good technical capabilities for ICS  Even after taking into account the differences between ICS and ICT, teams developing ICS-CERC still  have to decide what services they will provide to their constituency. This section provides a brief  overview of some of the services that are and can be provided in the ICS area. It also explains how  the nature of ICS cyber-security influences these services, and looks at current practices from  existing teams to deliver services in ICS area.  55  For more information see the article ‘IT security vendors seen as clueless on industrial control systems‘  (http://www.csoonline.com/article/733873/it-security-vendors-seen-as-clueless-on-industrial-control- systems)  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Alerts/Warnings  Incident Coordination  Technology Watch  Incident Response  Announcements  Advisory Distribution  Education and Awareness  Vulnerability Assessments  Security Audits  Penetration Testing  Page 17  2.2.1.1 Incident handling  Incident handling is a core service that every CERT must provide, and should also be considered a  core service in the ICS area, even though incident handling services in the ICS context are often  challenging to develop (as mentioned before). Some reasons for this being a challenging task include  for example the difference in type and priority of incidents, different standards and procedures to  deal with and manage them, the type and size of the network and (national, regional or global)  distributed network nodes (ICS objects).  Often ICS-networks are autonomous, completely separated or stand-alone, sometimes distributed  systems across the network (with different ICS/security solutions and vendors), following different  legal regulations, policies and strategies across the national borders. In addition, what counts as an  incident handling service can be perceived differently by different actors, e.g. as incident response,  coordination, on-site support, or advisory services. There are also other aspects to consider while  deploying ICS-CERC as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter: the scope of the mandate and  current services provided by the existing team or requirements for the personnel.  There are several problems that can arise in the context of incident handling that can be specific to  the ICS arena, and in particular tend to affect parties' willingness and ability to share information  with a team responsible for incident handling in this area:   Concerning ICS vendors: obtaining timely information about ICS incidents, vulnerabilities  and patches could be challenging if it is not clearly defined in SLAs for specific ICS products;   Concerning ICS providers /ISPs: ICS cyber-security incidents are sometimes not discovered in  a timely manner due to providers' lack of proper security detection capacity;   Concerning ICS asset owners: there could be a lack of trust or willingness to cooperate  especially if the team’s responsibilities (mandate) are not clearly identified (e.g. necessity of  reporting incidents in CII area).  There is broad agreement that there is not yet sufficient sharing of information about ICS cyber- security events. Still there does not seem to be significant support for mandatory reporting of ICS  incidents affecting critical infrastructure by ICS providers (or other actors) to governments or other  entities with ICS-CERC responsibilities. This makes it more complicated to carry out ICS-CERC  responsibilities, and should be taken into account by teams trying to develop strategies for  deploying their capabilities with these players.  The problem of encouraging parties to share information makes it more important that teams with  ICS responsibilities know which parties to turn to when handling incidents:   CERTs offer advisories about emerging security risks or about incidents seen elsewhere56;   Vendors offer security patches and updates, and are good resources for general information  about ICS technologies and equipment;   ICS Asset owners should be involved in discussions about how to improve their business  models, which includes taking into account obtaining ICS cyber-security services;   ICS Service providers/ISPs should share information about network outages and cyber- security incidents and can help minimise the impact of these incidents to the extent  possible;   Other teams with ICS-CERC can be valuable in terms of obtaining information about  challenges they have faced and best practices, as well as potential cooperation in terms of  responding to a particular incident.  56  In Europe provided for example by CERT-FI or CERT-BUND.  Page 18  Teams with ICS-CERC responsibilities need to take on the challenge of growing into a trusted partner  to these other types of players when it comes to the incident handling service provision. Reluctance  to share information about incidents will be a constant challenge for any team mandated with ICS  incident response capabilities.  The incident handling process should involve as many of the parties discussed above as possible,  including ICS vendors, operators, and service providers, as well as the impacted party and the ICS- CERC team. Because of the challenges involved with incident handling, it is an area in which teams  with ICS-CERC responsibilities can demonstrate their value, importance and experience to their  constituents. Thus, it is very important that they develop strong and consistent incident handling  capability in the area!  As mentioned previously, ICS incident handling service could encompass a number of actions:   Providing technical support to the victim of an attack;   Guiding the attack victim to recovery;   Developing a process for protection in the event of similar future attacks;   Alerting other potential attack targets without disclosing confidential information;   Assessing and relating the incident to other events (with the help of authorities).  Another challenge teams with ICS CERC responsibilities face is that some ICS asset owners do not  have well defined cyber-security incident response processes in place.  Incident Detection  An initial task for teams responsible for providing incident handling service is to acquire information  about an on-going cyber-incident affecting an industrial control system. There is usually no legal  responsibility for ICS asset owners, vendors, or network service providers to report incidents, and  these players may not be comfortable with sharing this information.  This makes it important for the teams with ICS responsibilities to demonstrate trustworthiness and  transparency and instil confidence in their abilities to handle data and information with sufficient  confidentiality.  There are a number of steps that can be taken to make it less burdensome for the players to share  information.  Respondent from the ICS sector: \"The main hindrance [to effective incident handling] is  the possibility of being heavily penalized for disclosing such information, which results in  loss of credibility and value for the company. The way to overcome this would be to  establish a non-governmental (CERT) entity dealing with ICS incidents.\"  CERT respondent: \"It is important that ICS vendors, operators, and ISPs are all involved in  the incident handling process. Vendors often do not disclose all information, although  they have to provide patches and work on mitigation of the incident. Operators tend to  ask CERTs for assistance. Therefore, CERTs are perfectly fit to act as an intermediary and  coordinator of incident handling management.\"  Page 19   Incident detection services (on the site of asset provider): Incident detection is usually  within the responsibility of the ICS asset provider. The incident detection infrastructure  should be in place on site of these stakeholders. A team with ICS responsibilities can provide  advice about the security settings (risk assessments, if needed, for example)   Incident verification: A team with ICS-CERC needs to be able to verify that an incident is on- going by discussing it with the reporting party and through data analysis. Current practice is  to use various means of communicating with other players, including SSL-protected  websites, PGP-encrypted emails and telephone calls.57   Acquiring data: It is important that teams offering ICS-CERC services have the correct and  complete set of data about an ICS cyber-security incident to respond appropriately.  Common data points that should be collected include: the type of ICS incident (accident,  virus, etc.), data about the possible attacker, the system and hardware impacted, a brief  incident description and the incident's impact. It is advisable that teams follow common  CERT incident reporting formats with adjustments for ICS incidents.   Coordination: Coordination is an important element of efforts to respond to detected ICS  incidents. Teams with ICS-CERC should coordinate with a variety of players, including: the  impacted ICS organisation, the team's own host organisation, vendors, operators, network  service providers, or relevant governmental bodies. Contact information should be regularly  checked and updated. It is also important that teams developing ICS-CERC disseminate their  contact information on a regular basis to their constituency.   Incident response tools: A team with ICS-CERC responsibility has to have the necessary tools  to handle an incident. For traditional CERTs, ENISA has grouped tools into seven functional  groups, which also make sense for ICS cyber-incident response efforts, given that  interviewees say that the processes for responding to an ICS incident are generally similar to  those for an ICT incident.58  57  The practice also shows that ICS players (providers or owners) are not very familiar with, or equipped with,  the security level of communication (e.g. PGP encryption).  58  For more information see ENISA’s Clearinghouse for Incident Handling Tools at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/chiht  Page 20  Figure 8: ICS incident handling tools59  Note: Activities related to detection of an ICS incident are usually the responsibility of the ICS provider. That is  why the teams with ICS-CERC services could have, for example, an advisory or coordination role in this regard  (it usually doesn’t have the access to the network itself.)  Incident Containment  At this stage, the teams with ICS-CERC need to take an active part in the whole process of incident  management. They especially need to assess the impact of the incident on the critical infrastructure  in the country and ensure (in collaboration with the ICS asset owner or provider) that the incident  does not spread further and avoid greater damage.  Once information about an ICS cyber-security incident has been obtained, the necessary steps must  then be taken to respond to the incident, according to the initial priority of the incident. The initial  priority has to be assigned by an ICS incident reporter such as a system administrator of a particular  industrial control system (following defined incident categorisation policy). Then, based on more  general knowledge or incident escalation procedure (e.g. other ICS providers are complaining about  identical/ similar incidents) the priority can be changed/ raised.  Containment can be especially important in the industrial control system environment because of  the special considerations associated with ICS security, including among others60:   Performance requirements: Industrial control systems are time-critical by nature in terms of  the levels of acceptable delay and jitter, which means that attacks on ICS need to be  contained as quickly as possible.   Availability requirements: ICS processes are often continuous in nature, which means that  there cannot be outages or that outages should be planned in advance.   Risk management requirements: ICS cyber-security incidents can threaten human life and  injury, endanger public health or confidence, raise regulatory compliance issues, and cause  59  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management (Section 8.9)  60  National Institute of Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems (ICS) Security, Section 3-1 (2011)  Incident Handling Tools  Proactive Audit or  Detection Tools  Evidence Gathering  at Incident Scene  Investigating  Evidence of an  Incident  Supportive Tools  for Handling  Evidence  Providing Secure  Remote Access  Recovering the  System After an  Incident  Implementing ICS-CERC  Operational  Procedures  Page 21  the loss of equipment or valuable intellectual property, all of which make containment  critical.  As a result, the necessary steps to prepare to respond to incidents must be taken. In particular,  processes and policies are needed for:   Handling evidence: The nature of ICS cyber-security incidents 61means that evidence will  have to be handled which is confidential, sensitive, or proprietary in nature. Thus,  consideration must be given about how to handle such evidence so as to not lose the  support and trust of constituents.62   Documentation: Incident response processes need to be documented properly. This is  important both for confidence and capability building, and also helps prepare records for  analysis and lessons learnt from previous cases.   Role distribution: Effectively containing an ICS incident means having well-defined roles and  responsibilities among different players that are involved and responsible for the successful  containment.  Incident Remedy  Remedial actions for an ICS cyber-security event should include mitigating the incident's short- and  longer-term impact on the affected organisation, escalating the response as necessary, and ensuring  that the right lessons are learned so that the same incident does not happen again. As with other  aspects of responding to ICS cyber-security incidents, the nature and the possible criticality of ICS  cyber-incidents should be taken into account when the incident remedy or escalation procedures are  being set up.  Mitigation is generally a core objective of remedying an incident. Impacted ICS providers mostly  escalate the incident only when it is severe enough to seriously affect their production. So the  remedy depends on several aspects, for example on the incident severity (affecting energy supplies,  transport flows or even people’s lives), criticality of the system, nature of the intrusion (large-scale  DDoS attack), etc. Incident mitigation can be a core activity that can help to both minimise an  organisation's loss and mitigate the weaknesses that the attacker exploited.  In order for this service to bring real benefits to the constituents, it is important that the necessary  arrangements are made on the part of interested stakeholders. Teams need to have in place  resources and an operational mode for responding to and mitigating the impact of ICS incidents. The  ICS providers need to have effective mechanisms and processes for incident detection and  potentially sharing of the incident data with ICS-CERC teams. The ICS vendors also have an important  role to play: to provide patches and improvements to their solutions in line with evolving nature of  cyber-attacks on ICS. As a result ICS and the infrastructure need to be configured correctly  (hardening) and access rights need to be assigned adequately.  Due to the nature and potential consequences of ICS cyber-security incidents, responses to incidents  may need to be escalated either within their host organisations (company) or to the appropriate  reporting bodies (e.g. governmental entity responsible for cyber-security over CIIP, if applicable).  The nature of threats to industrial control systems might have a huge impact on different assets.  When public safety or environmental damage is at issue, remedying the incident or preventing  61  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems/can-we-learn-from-scada-security-incidents  62  For example, it concerns evidence handling of the Indicators of Compromise (IoC).  Page 22  worse case scenarios from occurring will mean bringing other parties into the discussion. As with  other aspects of ICS cyber-security responses, this means that there must be a plan in place for  escalating the response to an incident before it causes great damage.63 64  Remedying an ICS cyber-security incident also means not allowing it to happen again. There is both  an information sharing and analytical side to this. It means having procedures in place for sharing  information about cyber-incidents, while taking into account legitimate confidentiality concerns of  ICS organisations, vendors, and other impacted players. One of the formats used for automatic  sharing of information on incidents in a unified way is OpenIOC.65  Incident Closure  Closing off an ICS cyber-incident is the last step of the incident handling process. Some aspects of  incident closure (such as artifact handling, etc.) may be difficult to provide due to lack of resources.  Even within the ‘traditional’ CERT community many national and governmental CERTs do not offer  artifact handling services.66 Thus, cooperation with the host organisation and reaching agreements  with sources of funding will be an important part of efforts to develop these specific services. The  importance of for example artifact handling services should not be underestimated, as they can help  to understand why an ICS cyber-security incident occurred (and, in consequence, prevent it from  happening again.  Other aspects of incident closure, including dissemination of ‘lessons learned’, are less resource- intensive, but still require the investment of time and manpower to be planned and implemented.  The incident closure has to be closely coordinated among teams with ICS responsibilities and ICS  providers (doing follow-up onsite modifications to their ICS like reconfiguration). ICS vendors need to  be involved after lessons have been learned, in order to upgrade and modify ICS solutions and  become more resilient to cyber threats.  It is important that teams with ICS responsibilities keep records of ICS incidents and provide periodic  summary reports. These summary reports are a valuable source for updating national cyber-security  strategies in general and strategies for critical (information) infrastructure protection in particular.  On a European level it would be useful to have overall European statistics on ICS security as well.  These could take a similar form to that used for reporting ‘Article 13’ incidents in the Member  States.67 Providing comprehensive statistics will be welcomed by ICS-CERC teams, vendors, providers  and asset owners alike, which have up to now relied mostly on reports from ICS-CERT in the US.  2.2.2 Maturity of capabilities and further improvement of operational services  Consideration should be given at an early stage as to how to improve and further develop technical  capabilities (service portfolio) once a team responsible for developing ICS-CERC is off the ground.  The shifting nature of cyber-threats facing industrial control systems necessitates this, as does the  fact that constituencies will expect more as they feel more comfortable in their cooperation.  63  One recent example of such a disaster recovery plan for critical infrastructure:  http://www.state.il.us/iema/disaster/pdf/IDRP/IDRP_AnnexH.pdf  64  Detailed information on ENISA’s work in cyber crisis management and national contingency plans is available  at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation.  65  http://www.openioc.org/  66  See conclusions of ENISA’s report on Baseline Capabilites of national/ governmental CERTs:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/status-report-2012  67  See ENISA’s Annual Incident Report 2011 report: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Page 23  Further development of ICS-CERC should consider two main areas:  1. Deepening and improving services already offered. In particular, this will mean refining and  improving the processes for handling ICS cyber-security incidents, as this is a core service to  provide.  2. Broadening the scope of services offered. Constituents will want more services as they grow  comfortable with the roles of ICS-CERC available to them, whether these services are in  areas such as providing training courses or beginning to offer specific services (e.g. artifact  handling) associated with the incident handling process.  Page 24  2.3 ICS operational capabilities: Organisational considerations  Operational considerations for teams with ICS capabilities should focus on making sure that the right  support is in place for the ICS-CERC services, including having the right personnel, providing training  that reflects the ICS environment and ensures that staff have the right skills and knowledge, and  working with the host organisation to make positioning of the ICS capabilities as beneficial as  possible.  2.3.1 When to provide services for ICS – which operational mode to choose?  As is the case for CERTs dealing with ‘traditional’ ICT systems, teams with ICS responsibilities must  consider incident handling to be a core service, to an even greater extent because ICS failures  resulting from attacks, human errors and other causes often have immediate effects on assets and  potentially lives. Examples include energy catastrophes such as oil spills, floods, leakages of  dangerous chemicals, major rail incidents, or power outages. Therefore, a 24/7 reachability regime  for incident reporting and handling is a necessity for this part of reactive services, because of the  possible critical impact of an incident occurring in the ICS environment.  However, for the other groups of services provided by CERTs (proactive services and security quality  management services68) the operating regime can be business hours only. In the case of some  services like technology watch, the operational regime could be defined and agreed in cooperation  with private companies, including ICS technology vendors.  When deciding upon the operational mode, it is important to consider whether such a model is  already in place at the team entrusted with providing ICS-CERC services or whether this will need to  be built up from scratch and with additional resources. There is also the need for ICS-CERC teams to  determine whether existing CERT IT software and solutions can be applied to ICS-related incidents.  For most of the typical CERT services this can often be the case, only for specific services like  penetration testing or reverse engineering the settings might be different.  Last but not least legal aspects have to be taken into account. This may prove the most challenging  task as protection of ICS is related to national security matters and the legislation in this area is very  specific – as is the accompanying information process, which is usually highly sensitive.  2.3.2 The right personnel for the ICS environment  Having quality staff is critical for developing and providing ICS-CERC services. Human resources  requirements will depend on factors such as mandate, constituency, available resources, regulatory  and business drivers, and operational hours. Staffing correctly means finding individuals with the  right experience and capabilities as well as reaching a size sufficient to carry out the mandate.  In terms of division of responsibilities and roles, there are different potential team sizes and divisions  of responsibilities that can be used. The structure to be used by a particular team should be based  on considerations such as its mandate, its host organisation, the services it is providing, resources  available to it, and the services that it plans to provide in the future. For example, when an incident  handling service in a particular operational mode is being offered, personnel and resources must  reflect this. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that as ICS capabilities are in the early stages of  being developed, resources and personnel may need to be distributed differently than when higher  levels of operational maturity have been reached.  There is no one solution for dividing staff’s responsibilities that will suit every team with ICS  responsibilities. As a general matter, there are additional specifications to the ordinary CERT team  68  For a detailed definition of CERT/CSIRT services see: http://www.cert.org/csirts/services.html.  Page 25  composition (e.g. for CIIP strategy and policy as well as ICS risk analysis and contingency planning),  as these are core matters where ICS-CERC are being created. Beyond this, technical expertise with  ICS skills and knowledge will be needed to ensure that incident handling and other services related  to ICS can be provided at a high level.  The general process for hiring staff for developing ICS-CERC services will be similar to that for  traditional CERTs, but the specificity of the ICS context should be kept in mind. In particular, staff for  teams with ICS-CERC responsibilities should have specialised knowledge and skills that relate to the  aspects of providing ICS cyber-security capabilities discussed previously in this document. Most  important for developing ICS-CERC will be reaching a base level of staffing either with these skills or  of individuals who are capable of obtaining the skills to provide the ICS-CERC services to be offered.  6970  The hiring process for staff on teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC is an important matter  that should be given sufficient consideration. In particular, the process should acknowledge the fact  that staff will be dealing with CII matters and helping ICS players handle incidents that have the  potential to cause significant damage. This means that staff should be vetted thoroughly during the  recruitment process, and consideration should be given to factors such as individuals’ ability to  perform under pressure and willingness to be on-call for incident handling and response at non- working hours. This is important not only for the development of ICS-CERC on a team, but also for  making sure that ICS vendors, industry players, and even governmental agencies are comfortable  working with the team as it establishes ICS-CERC services.  Pre-employment screening methods provide a good tool for the hiring process. Pre-employment  screening is a type of check that employers conduct either before they offer a candidate a job or  during the hiring process. The types of screenings include criminal background checks, credit checks,  employment history verification, education verification, and driving record checks or other specific  on-demand checking. However, this pre-employment screening should be done only for pre-selected  candidates fulfilling the main requirements: the technical knowledge and experience. In some cases  69  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller  70  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Terminal_Unit  CERT respondent: \"There are very specific knowledge domains associated with control  systems versus commodity cyber infrastructure. Not only technical, but business  knowledge as well. It is important to understand the economic drivers of an industrial  sector in order to effectively work with them to improve their cyber security.\"  CERT respondent \"Despite bearing a lot of similar characteristics with traditional IT  systems, there are special ICS features that incident handlers must be knowledgeable of.\"  Respondent from ICS sector: \"While, for example, forensics analysis is the same, ICS  incident handlers must possess the knowledge and capabilities to deal with specifics of  PLC and RCU.\"  Page 26  additional certificates might be requested (e.g. allowing access to confidential information), which  are issued by authorised bodies (usually ministries of the interior/home offices).  It must be decided whether an existing team should be commissioned with developing ICS-CERC  services or a new team should be set up for this. Staff from existing CERTs can be entrusted and  appointed, particularly for matters which are not necessarily ICS-specific, including the typical CERT  operations and capabilities related to distributing information. The use of and sharing of staff  between teams is desirable from several perspectives, including cost-saving, administrative  knowledge sharing, and building capital for the team with ICS-CERC at other organisations.  2.3.3 Training personnel for the ICS environment  Training for ICS environments should be given significant consideration, as it is a core part of efforts  to develop ICS-CERC services. The first matter to be considered is who can be offered training. Of  course, teams with ICS-CERC will need to offer sufficient training opportunities, but they should also  consider working with other members of the ICS community when it comes to training. For example,  ICS vendors, asset owners, and providers all need continual training as well to keep their staff up to  date on ICS cyber-security matters. Thus, it will often make sense for teams developing ICS-CERC  services to collaborate with these stakeholders, which creates mutual benefits.  Collaboration can be  useful in creating the type of ICS-holistic grounds for discussion that could have significant benefits  not only for the team with ICS-CERC services in developing its capabilities but also for helping to  build cooperation between it and ICS players in its market.  Beyond an ICS-specific view, teams with ICS-CERC responsibility can also consider whether  cooperation with established CERTs could be useful in providing training. The ‘traditional’ CERTs are  often better established, have longer track records of offering training to their staff and  constituents, and may have more resources. Of course, this cooperation will typically be most  fruitful in areas where ICT and ICS activities and services overlap, but CERTs may find that their staff  also benefit from building up knowledge about industrial control systems. This is especially the case  where the ICS agenda falls under one team’s responsibilities.  The specific nature of providing ICS-CERC services has to be considered, though. In particular, the  impact of ICS cyber-security incidents can differ, as discussed in this document, and the methods to  be taken to mitigate these impacts will be different as well. Moreover, the ICS technical environment  is often an autonomous, internal network, which means that cyber-security threats can show  different characteristics from conventional ICT systems and networks. There are also software- and  hardware-specific protocols that are used for ICS, and training for ICS cyber-security capabilities has  to take these specifications into account as well. These factors can make it more challenging to  provide training in the ICS area than in the traditional ICT domain.  As a result, training opportunities for staff must be constantly sought out by teams responsible for  developing ICS-CERC services, especially when resources are limited. Cooperation with CERTs and  other organisations which provide training in this area can lower the costs of the actual training, as  can virtual training programmes. For example, the SANS institute offers a number of virtual training  programmes in the ICS area, which could either be used by teams with ICS-CERC responsibility  or as  a basis for developing similar offerings.71 ENISA also provides extensive online training material for  CERTs including virtual images, handbooks and toolsets for students and lecturers.72 This training  and exercise material is provided free and can, on request by a EU Member State, be applied by  ENISA trainers.  71  See http://www.sans.org/vlive/sessions  72  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  Page 27  2.3.4 Suitable hosting organisation for ICS incident response capabilities  The host organisation has a strong influence on the development of ICS-CERC, because its power and  position in the national CIIP policies and processes can streamline measures aimed at enhancing  cyber-security. It can also allow more flexibility when dealing with incidents (e.g. escalation  procedure). It can be considered as an advantage if the host organisation of a team with ICS  responsibilities has an important position as regards planning and execution of national policies in  CIIP. This is especially true while escalating incidents, when a direct line of communication to  national bodies responsible for CIIP plays a crucial role.  Different institutions could act as hosting organisations for teams charged with developing ICS-CERC.  For capabilities aimed at the national level, n/g CERTs (or rather their host organisations) are just  one of the options available. The well-established teams with ICS responsibility are usually parts of  and/or funded by organisations with coordinating roles in national policies on CIIP (see below).  The baseline organisational needs of teams with ICS-CERC services might be similar to those of an  existing CERT, including ensuring that they receive sufficient funding from the host organisation,  have well-defined lines of responsibility and reporting, legal support, and determining whether they  can use their host organisation's experience, expertise, and resources for their effective and efficient  operation.  The teams that now exist at national level, that have ICS responsibility (for example ICS-CERT in the  US) provide interesting insights into potential ways to position those teams. US ICS-CERT's host  organisation for example is the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center  (NCCIC), which is under the auspices of the Office of Cybersecurity & Communications (CS&C), which  is embedded within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The organisational chart for the DHS, CS&C and NCCIC is shown below:  Figure 9: US DHS organisational chart73  73  Available at http://www.dhs.gov/about-national-cybersecurity-communications-integration-center  Page 28  As another example in Japan ICS cyber-security is not separated out from the responsibilities of the  n/g CERT. JP-CERT/CC operates its ICS-CERC services as an element of its ‘traditional’ duties.  JPCERT/CC (almost fully funded by METI – Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry)74 supports its  constituency with several types of ICS cyber-security services, including incident handling, ICS  product vulnerability coordination, and awareness raising.  In Europe the current practice shows that ICS-CERC services have been developed either within the  n/g CERT itself (Slovenia, Denmark) or within an organisation closely related to the n/g CERT  activities (Portugal in academic and also de facto national CERT, Germany in Federal Office for  Information Security, FORTH in Greece as a CERT). The host organisation characteristics regarded  most positively by the teams with ICS responsibilities include:   If the host organisation is not a regulator or military agency, it is easier for the teams to  develop and maintain strong trust relationships with ICS vendors, industry sectors and other  private sector organisations.   It turns out that the best collaborative relationships are voluntary, not mandatory.   It is an advantage to use reputation, experience, expertise, contacts and infrastructure of the  host organisation in cyber-security and ICS.  74  http://www.meti.go.jp/english/  CERT respondent: \"We are a government institution that does not aim at making a profit –  the industry partners appreciate this a lot.\"  Page 29  2.4 How and why to develop good cooperative incident response  capabilities for the ICS sector  2.4.1 Importance of cooperation  A cyber-incident impacting an industrial control system can have a significant negative impact not  only on the organisation itself; it can also harm national security, cause injury or death of  organisation employees or community members, damage equipment or the environment, or disrupt  supply chains. ICS information infrastructure has become more interlinked in recent years, to an  extent that ICS organisations themselves may not even be fully aware. This means that threats can  rapidly cross boundaries between organisations and even nations.75  The attacks may be intentional and targeted like the well-known Stuxnet76, a piece of malicious  software detected in 2010, which focuses specifically on Siemens software and hardware, modifying  the logics of Siemens S7 PLC microcontrollers and hiding this from the supervisory software  application/ operators. Unintentional consequences or collateral damage from other attacks (not  particularly targeted at the ICS) like worms, viruses or even simple ICS failures may, for example,  cause havoc in railway and other transport flows.77 But there are also unintentional incidents caused  within ICS organisations while for example testing new software on operational systems or  unauthorised changes to system configuration.78  This reality makes cooperation at any level crucial and indispensable for teams which have incident  response responsibility over the ICS networks. The appointed team must serve as a single point of  contact for all ICS organisations within its constituency. Further, this team should be a well-regarded  incident responder and a trusted disseminator of important information. This makes developing  trust with other similar teams and their constituencies very important, as well as cooperation  between them and other (ICS) partners such as national bodies responsible for CIIP policies and ICS  assets owners, provider and vendors. Trust is to be based on win-win aspects of collaboration, as for  the constituents it is important to instigate collaboration as an open partnership, rather than to put  in place a strict regulatory regime with sanctioning powers.  75  For more information on previous ENISA studies in the area of interdependencies see for example ‘Cyber  Security Aspects in the Maritime Sector’ (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical- infrastructure-and-services/dependencies-of-maritime-transport-to-icts), ‘Emergency Communications  Stocktaking’ (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and- services/emergency-communications-stocktaking), ‘Good Practices for Resilient Internet Interconnections’  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter- x/resilience-of-interconnections) or the already mentioned ‘Protection of ICS: Recommendations for Europe  and Member States’ (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and- services/scada-industrial-control-systems)  76  Falliere, Nicolas, Murchu, Liam O and Chien, Eric.

ICS respondent: \"The high level of trust is crucial for effective incident handling.\"  Page 30  The importance of cooperation at both a domestic and international level must be recognised and  implemented at an early stage when building the capabilities. In ideal circumstances, the  cooperation links should be well defined and workable with CIIP policy bodies, law enforcement  agencies and the intelligence community to coordinate incident response efforts among federal,  regional and local governments, when necessary.  However, the priority is to establish and maintain collaborative relations with all ICS, assets owners  and vendors concerning providers within the constituency according to the service portfolio. In  addition, cooperation needs to be extended to other CERTs in order to share ICS-related security  incidents and mitigation measures.79  Including all these stakeholders will contribute to strengthening the resilience of national critical  (information) infrastructures, and thus national security, and to mitigating the impact of the ICS  incidents based on the lessons learned. Broader exchange of best practices among the teams with  ICS responsibility is necessary to improve the incident response capabilities of these systems in the  future.  2.4.2 Choosing partners for cooperation at the national level  The underlying objective and focus for teams with ICS responsibility must be to protect critical  information infrastructure and support the seamless functioning of ICS that are indispensable for  this infrastructure. It is of utmost importance to understand the difference in approaches to solving  incidents in traditional ICT systems and those affecting ICS (as laid out in this report). While for ICT  systems confidentiality and integrity might be the main concern, for ICS these factors pertain to  human safety, environmental impacts and the process itself (loss of equipment/ production).  Therefore; availability ranks highest among the three fundamental characteristics of cyber-security  in this area. This aspect needs to be reflected in cooperation between teams with ICS-CERC and  relevant stakeholders.  The cooperation activities will often involve many actors, including governmental bodies, law  enforcement agencies (LEA), CERTs in the country, and mostly private sector companies dealing with  ICS. The cooperation with national CIIP authorities must be formally established and based on  national CIIP strategies and regulations. With private or semi-private ICS constituents the  cooperation is generally voluntary, which makes it important for the team to demonstrate  trustworthiness, reliability and operational incident response capabilities.  ICS asset owners and services providers  Cooperation and communication with ICS providers and asset owners is also crucial. Unfortunately,  lack of knowledge about a team's existence or its capabilities can make it more challenging for the  team to benefit from cooperative efforts at a domestic level with these partners. So, the first task  (much more important than in the case of other cooperative partners) is to promote awareness of  their own existence and their value proposition for the constituents.  The informal nature of cooperation and maintaining trust-based personal contacts is advisable, again  more so than in the case of other cooperative partners, based on the observed practice for effective  service delivery and a fruitful bilateral collaboration. This relates especially to on-site visits of ICS- CERC team’s personnel to ICS asset owners’ facilities (like transport control systems in railway or air  traffic, power plants, dams, chemical factories, food processing) in order for the technical personnel  to get acquainted with specific features of ICS in the constituency. Staff who maintains the systems  79  See Control Systems Security Program, ICS-CERT, available at http://ics-cert.us- cert.gov/sites/default/files/DHS_CyberSecurity_ICSCERT-FactSheet-v8.pdf  Page 31  (e.g. system administrators, PLC operators) should be educated in the more general issues of cyber- security and incident handling.  One challenge that is likely to arise is to establish a good operational incident reporting mechanism  with the ICS providers. In the short term, it will not be easy to mandate such cooperation because of  a general skepticism, lack of knowledge or trust in the team’s discreetness. The outlined cooperative  approach which is based more or less on a voluntary model (after the industry players become  aware of the ICS-CERC’s existence and especially its usefulness) is probably the best way to start. In  the longer term, teams with ICS-CERC should work with the national policymakers and ICS asset  owners and providers to discuss whether mandatory incident reporting could improve the practice  and bring any additional value to the operations.  ICS vendors  Cooperation and timely information sharing with ICS vendors is also very important. ICS vendors face  their own challenges in terms of convincing their customers of the importance of ICS cyber-security,  and have to be realistic in that their customers' interest levels in ICS cyber-security matters can  depend primarily on whether they have already been impacted by a cyber-security incident or not.  ICS vendors must focus on ensuring the security of their products and services, and it is important  that teams with ICS-CERC services understand how vendors are trying to accomplish this to improve  their cooperation and lines of communication. Vendors can do this in a number of ways, but broadly  speaking, they will try to:   Integrate security features into their devices and then help their customers maintain  security through service-level agreements (SLA);   Implement security standards (e.g. ISA/IEC-62443, formerly ISA 99) 80  and compliance  requirements (e.g. North American Electric Reliability Corporation-Critical Infrastructure  Protection (NERC-CIP) compliance requirements);   Provide best practices to their customers on how to implement security features to their  products;   Provide follow-up services to their customers, including patches and vulnerability  announcements.81  To the extent that teams with ICS-CERC capabilities can form positive relationships with vendors, this  can be beneficial to their efforts to offer quality and timely ICS services (like alerts and warnings) to  their constituency.  N/g CERTs and other CERTs  The relationship with the n/g CERT in its country is especially important – especially where ICS-CERC  services should be provided at a national level. Their activities must generally be coherent and  streamlined (complementary to each other if feasible), for example in the case of coordination of  incident management processes. It is up to the Member States to decide whether teams with ICS  responsibility should be separate entities, divisions of existing n/g CERTs or work under any other  arrangements. But as n/g CERTs are regarded as a single point of contact for other CERTs within the  boundaries of their countries and globally, it is desirable that ICS-CERC teams also join the CERT  communities. Via these platforms they will be in a better position to exchange information on  ‘general’ ICT incidents and ICS in particular as some industrial CERTs may also take part in the  activities of these platforms.  80  http://www.isa.org/autowest/pdf/Industrial-Networking-and-Security/Phinneydone.pdf.  81  Analysis based on interviews with vendors conducted in conjunction with this study.  Page 32  National bodies responsible for CIIP agenda  As ICS in sectors like energy, water treatment, transport, chemicals and others constitute a part of  critical infrastructure, it is a necessity that the team responsible for ICS area establishes and  maintains a good relationship and cooperation with all relevant bodies responsible for CIIP at  national level. This cooperation can be defined in national CIIP strategies and regulations. The  criticality of ICS requires that such cooperation can be activated as fast as possible after a serious  incident affecting ICS, and therefore critical infrastructure, is detected. Possible arrangements for  the cooperation could take a form of a cyber-security council or national crisis committee. The teams  with ICS-CERC will probably not have the main decision-making role, but should have an advisory  role, because of the incident response expertise.  Law enforcement agencies  Cooperation with law enforcement agencies (LEA) is another key domestic relationship. As the  attacks on critical infrastructure can have criminal aspects (sabotage, act of terrorism or other  hostile political motives), the police and the judiciary also need to be involved. It is necessary to bear  in mind that the information flow will probably be mostly unidirectional – from the team to LEAs as  is documented by current practice.82 On the other hand, the team should regard this cooperation as  one of its crucial partnerships due to the possible impact of ICS incidents, so the team should be a  valuable source of information and expertise for LEAs. For example, the above-mentioned Stuxnet  can be considered as a reference model, a step-by-step guideline for a future generation of malware  against ICS.  2.4.3 Cooperation at cross-border level  ICS cyber-security and threats raise specific issues touching on sensitive matters such as national  security that are less common with traditional ICT cyber-attacks. This makes information sharing  harder to achieve, especially across borders, and will in turn place a significant benefit to trust. It  needs to be said that with the interlinking of ICS across borders the complexity of cooperation and  especially legal implications increases.  Cyber-attacks on industrial control systems may easily occur across national borders and impact  organisations with operations in many different countries. The attacks include massive distributed  denial of service attacks (DDoS), efforts to penetrate networks undetected, DNS poisoning, SQL  injection attacks or malware infections. The aims of the attacks vary from shutting down services or  operations to the theft of services and data or extortion attempts. According to a study ‘In the  Crossfire: Critical Infrastructure in the Age of Cyber War’ conducted by McAfee,83 the most sensitive  82  See ENISA’s report on information sharing between CERTs and law enforcement agencies at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/supporting-fight-against- cybercrime/cooperation-between-certs-and-law-enforcement-agencies-in-the-fight-against-cybercrime-a-first- collection-of-practices/at_download/fullReport  83  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-in-crossfire-critical-infrastructure-cyber-war.pdf  CERT respondent: \"The implementation method and placement of countermeasures or  defences may be different [for ICS-CERC teams], and the business domain may also  impose different or stricter requirements towards reliability and availability.\"  Page 33  critical infrastructures in energy and natural-resource industries (such as water and sewage plants),  are some of the least secure. Executives at water and sewage facilities also reported having the  lowest level of security measures in place.84 Especially when these facilities are located close to  national borders (for example dams and water reservoirs), incidents affecting their control systems  may have serious repercussions for critical infrastructures in more Member States. However, the  immediate geographic distance is of less importance when it comes to attacks and disruptions  relating to power plants or transport flows.  Thus, incident responses may need to be coordinated across countries or synchronised between ICS  and other actors in a number of different countries. Further, best practices for responding to and  preventing attacks on industrial control systems become less and less country-specific. These factors  favor cooperation at the cross-border level, as is also necessary when dealing with large-scale cross- border ICT incidents.  This cooperation can create efficiencies in facilitating response for teams with ICS responsibility, for  example as regards mitigation of incident impacts that sever energy supplies and cross-border high- speed railway transport. Resources of the teams providing ICS-CERC services could be limited, and  capabilities need to be built up to face challenges resulting from the attacks on ICS. This means that  best practices need to be taken note of and used, and ICS knowledge should be built as efficiently as  possible. Knowledge sharing with other existing and experienced teams and industry players is one  relatively straightforward way to accomplish this.  On an international level, there are a number of challenges to cooperation on ICS cyber-security  matters. Teams with ICS responsibility are not as widespread or as well-known as traditional CERTs,  so there is not a robust network of similar players or a wide European community in place as teams  develop their ICS-CERC. However, as pointed out earlier in this document, utilising the expertise and  experience of existing CERT communities would be beneficial for a team charged with ICS-CERC  services.  A number of organisations offer international forums or facilitate cooperation among ICS players.85  Organisations that focus on ICS security matters such as CIGRE or even broader CERT community  organisations such as FIRST and industry associations can be useful resources, and could be  important to the development of operational and effective incident response cooperation at an  international level.  84  Ibid.  85  For more information see 2.1.5 and footnote 36.  A respondent from the ICS sector noted very good cooperation within NAMUR, an  international user association in the chemical and pharmaceutical processing industries,  where information is shared among attendees.  Another respondent noted that his team is a member of FIRST and that its customers were  willing to discuss ICS-related matters with it in this forum.  Page 34  CERTs with an ICS-CERC agenda are not always members of EuroSCSiE or any other European and  global initiative dealing with ICS and its cyber-security aspects. Teams to be tasked with ICS-CERC  services could welcome such discussions and forums and should take an active part in them. Thus,  participating in international ICS forums and developing relationships with other teams could be a  fundamental part of efforts by teams with ICS-CERC to develop and to better serve their  constituents. Besides, it is recommended that such teams seek recognition among the wider CERT  community. Membership to or accreditation at FIRST or Trusted Introducer, 86  although not  specifically focused on ICS, can be a very good step to gaining recognition and acceptance by experts  in the area of incident response capabilities. Some of the industry players are already engaged in  these organisations and initiatives via their incident response teams.  At the same time, it is logical to establish mutually beneficial bilateral relations with teams in other  countries. Some of the teams that can be seen as demonstrating good practices in ICS-CERC in  Europe and beyond have been mentioned in this document. Other examples will inevitably follow as  more teams with ICS-CERC are established and attain a certain degree of maturity.  86  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/index.html  Page 35  3 Conclusions  This document provided an overview of many of the important considerations for a team charged  with developing ICS-CERC services, with a special view on incident management capabilities. As  stressed throughout the document, there are some unique challenges associated with providing  cyber-security services for industrial control systems, but the process can be made more  manageable by following identified good practices for CERTs and taking into account experiences  which exist already in Europe and globally. Information sharing and cooperative efforts are  indispensable elements of the development efforts.  The responsible team needs to bear one paradigm in mind, which is different for ICS compared to  traditional ICT systems. It is the priority aspect on the three-stranded CIA security scale:  confidentiality, integrity, availability. While for traditional ICT systems the main priority is integrity,  for ICS availability ranks highest. This has a lot to do with the fact that ICS are indispensable for the  seamless operation of critical infrastructure. Cyber-incidents affecting ICS can have disastrous effects  on country’s economy and people’s lives. They can cause long power outages, paralyse transport  nationally and internationally and cause ecological catastrophes. In order to face these challenges, it  is of utmost importance that the team is equipped with all the capabilities of a ‘typical’ well- functioning CERT but with additional adjustments for the ICS environment.  As protection of critical infrastructure (and thus of ICS) is a matter of national interest, often  embedded in national CIIP strategies and regulations, there should be a clear mandate defined,  especially for incident management activities. The main constituents will be large ICS players (energy  companies, transport companies, chemical industry, food processing), which, unlike constituents of  traditional CERTs, sometimes do not have sufficient expertise in cyber-security. On the other hand,  the established CERTs do not necessarily understand or have a deeper knowledge of sector-specific  technical aspects of ICS.  Incident handling is a core service that every CERT must provide, and should also be considered a  core service in the ICS area. Incident handling service in the ICS context will be challenging to  develop, as a result of (for example) the type and priority of incidents, different standards and  procedures to deal with and manage, the type and size of the network and (national, regional or  global) distributed network nodes (ICS objects). An initial challenge for teams responsible for  providing incident handling service is to get information about an ongoing cyber-incident impacting  an industrial control system. There is usually no legal duty for private ICS asset owners, vendors, or  network service providers to report incidents, and these players may not be comfortable sharing this  information. This makes it important that a team demonstrates trustworthiness and transparency  and builds confidence in its abilities to handle data and information with complete confidentiality.  The hiring process for staff on teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC services is an important  matter that should be given sufficient consideration. In particular, the process should acknowledge  the fact that staff will be dealing with CII matters and helping ICS players handle incidents that have  the potential to cause significant damage. This means that staff should be vetted thoroughly in the  recruitment process, and consideration should be given to factors such as an individual’s ability to  perform under pressure and willingness to be on-call for incident handling and response at non- working hours. This is important not only for the development of ICS-CERC services in a team, but  also for making sure that ICS vendors, industry players, and even governmental agencies are  comfortable working with the team as it establishes its services.  The importance of cooperation at both the domestic and international level must be recognised  and implemented when building the incident response capabilities. In ideal circumstances, the team  partners with CIIP policy bodies, law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community,  Page 36  coordinates incident response efforts among federal, regional or local involved partners, and works  with ICS asset owners, operators, and vendors on regular basis. Additionally, teams should  collaborate with other ICS players and CERTs to share ICS-related security incidents and mitigation  measures. Including all these stakeholders will contribute to strengthening the resilience of national  critical (information) infrastructures, and thus national security, and to mitigating the impact of the  ICS incidents. Broad exchange of good practices among teams with ICS responsibility is necessary for  improving incident response capabilities in the future.  Page 37  Next steps  This document needs to be considered as an initial attempt to provide a good practice guide for the  teams to be tasked with incident response capability for industrial control systems. For this reason it  is a living document that will be periodically updated in line with the evolving cyber-security  landscape and, of course, also in line with experiences of the EU Member States in deploying this  capability in their respective countries. In addition to existing activities in ICS such as providing CERT  training material, ENISA is ready to facilitate the exchange of the good practices via aggregate  reports, analysis and CERT workshops. ENISA also welcomes and encourages any suggestions of ICS  stakeholders from the public, private and non-profit sectors with the objective to improve and  update this guide.

For better readability by avoiding repetition of abbreviations a couple of synonyms will  be used, depending on the context (i.e. ‘ICS-CERC services’ to depict those services, ‘ICS  responsibility’ to point to the overall mandate of a CERT in that context, etc.).  Executive summary  Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are indispensable for a number of industrial processes, including  energy distribution, water treatment, transportation, chemical, government, defence and food  processes. Though until a few decades ago ICS functioned in discrete environments, nowadays they  tend to be connected to the Internet. This enables streamlining and automation of industrial  processes, but carries with it the risk of exposure to cyber-attacks. The ICS are lucrative targets for  intruders like criminal groups, foreign intelligence, phishers, spammers or terrorists. Therefore, the  ability to respond to and mitigate the impact of ICS incidents is crucial for protecting critical  information infrastructure and enhancing cyber-security on a national, European and global level.  This document is an initial attempt to provide a good practice guide for the entities that have been  tasked to provide ICS Computer Emergency Response Capabilities (ICS-CERC). On the other hand,  this guide does not have the ambition to prescribe to the EU Member States which entities should  be entrusted with provision of ICS-CERC services.  This document builds upon the current practice of CERTs with responsibilities for ICS networks, and  also on the earlier work of ENISA on a baseline capabilities scheme for national/ governmental (n/g)  CERTs1. Consequently, it employs a similar approach in addressing the topics relevant for ICS-CERC  provision, by using four categories of baseline capabilities: mandate, service portfolio and operations  in relation to ICS-CERC and, last but not least, cooperation with the other ICS stakeholders. These  four categories of capabilities are mutually interdependent.  In the chapter on mandate capabilities the guide delves into formal processes for the establishment  of ICS-CERC. It mentions factors that need to be taken into account when building ICS-CERC rather  than building response capabilities for ‘ordinary’ ICT systems. The guide also addresses the  advantages and disadvantages of concrete types of the mandate: ICS sector-specific, national,  regional and global. It defines the constituencies for ICS-CERC and offers a variety of international  sources of inspiration for the mandate and other formal aspects of ICS-CERC.  Operational capabilities (technical) focus on actual ICS-CERC services to be provided, especially in  the main phases of the incident management cycle. The guide also briefly touches upon the question  of how to maintain, develop and improve ICS-CERC once it has been established.  The chapter on operational capabilities (organisational) deals with operational aspects required for  the provision of ICS-CERC services and also with dedicated personnel and their qualifications. The  guide highlights the importance of training and further education for the staff responsible for ICS- CERC and also raises the topic of a suitable hosting organisation for ICS-CERC.  The chapter on co-operational capabilities summarises the main reasons for on-going cooperation  between CERTs providing ICS-CERC services and other ICS stakeholders. In this context, the  peculiarities of both national cooperation (with ICS providers, vendors or CERTs in the country) and  1  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems  Computer Emergency Response Capabilities considerations for ICS  October 2013  Page  iv  cross-border cooperation (international initiatives in the area of ICS protection like CIGRE, ESCoRTS,  IEEE and others) are discussed.  Wherever appropriate, examples of current practices related to handling ICS incidents are  presented. However, it should be noted that established CERTs in Europe still have very limited  experience in and contact with ICS-CERC services. For these reasons, this guide needs to be  considered a living document, which will need to be updated in accordance with wider deployment  of ICS-CERC in Europe. ENISA is ready to provide support to the teams responsible for the provision  of ICS-CERC services. It already provides online training material for the CERTs relating to attacks on  critical information infrastructure (scenario 13 of CERT training material2).  2  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems  Computer Emergency Response Capabilities considerations for ICS  October 2013  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary iii  1 Introduction 1  1.1 Aim and scope of the document 1  1.2 European policy environment with regard to the ICS-CERC and critical information infrastructure 1  2 Recognised practices for ICS-CERC 4  2.1 Mandate considerations for ICS-CERC 6  2.1.1 Industrial Control Systems versus Information Communications Technology 6  2.1.2 Obtaining a Mandate 7  2.1.3 Span of Mandate 9  2.1.4 Defining the Mandate's Constituency 10  2.1.5 Seeking Input for Mandate 11  2.1.6 Importance of Mandate 12  2.2 ICS Operational Capabilities: Technical Considerations 14  2.2.1 CERT Services to Develop Good Technical Capabilities for ICS 16  2.2.2 Maturity of capabilities and further improvement of operational services 22  2.3 ICS Operational Capabilities: Organizational considerations 24  2.3.1 When to provide services for ICS – which operational mode to choose? 24  2.3.2 Right personnel for the ICS environment 24  2.3.3 Training the personnel for ICS environment 26  2.3.4 Suitable hosting organisation for ICS incident response capabilities 27  2.4 How and why to develop good cooperative incident response capabilities for the ICS sector 29  2.4.1 Importance of cooperation 29  2.4.2 Choosing partners for cooperation at the national level 30  2.4.3 Cooperation at cross-border level 32  3 Conclusions 35  Next steps 37  Page 1  1 Introduction  1.1 Aim and scope of the document  The objective of this guide is to provide good practice to build a Computer Emergency Response  Capabilities for Industrial Control Systems (ICS-CERC). It aims to support those teams that will be  entrusted with the provision of ICS-CERC in the EU Member States, and for the governments that  consider assigning a mandate for ICS-CERC to a team. The aim of the guide is not to make  recommendations on which bodies should be responsible for the provision of ICS-CERC. Such a  decision is within the competence of the EU Member States.  The guide builds on the current good practice of CERTs that are tasked with dealing with ICS security  incidents and on earlier work of ENISA in defining baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs.3 The four  categories of baseline capabilities (mandate & strategy, services, operation, cooperation) defined  previously by ENISA to describe a properly functioning CERT are, with some adjustments, the basis of  this document. Section 2, the core of the guide, examines in detail the four categories of baseline  capabilities required for the establishment and effective provision of ICS-CERC services.  Subject matter stakeholders were consulted. A number of CERTs in Europe and worldwide were  asked to respond to a survey on aspects of the above-mentioned four baseline capabilities in the  area of ICS protection. Several subsequent interviews were conducted with the representatives of  the crucial stakeholders: CERTs, ICS asset owners and vendors. The main and most interesting ideas  and opinions of these stakeholders are highlighted throughout the document.  1.2 European policy environment with regard to ICS-CERC and Critical  Information Infrastructure  Industrial control systems often constitute Critical Information Infrastructures (CII).4 The EU and its  Member States are aware of the increased exposure of ICS to outside malicious attacks. At the  European level the EU Member States are working on countermeasures to protect CII.5 An important  step was the adoption of the Directive on European Critical Infrastructures6 in 2008. The Directive  established a procedure for identifying and designating European Critical Infrastructures (ECI)7 and a  common approach for assessing the need to improve their protection. However; the Directive has a  rather sectorial scope, and refers only to the energy and transport sectors. In 2012, the Directive  3  ENISA, Baseline Capabilities for National/ Governmental CERTs (2009); Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of  National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report, 2012.  4  Critical information infrastructure was defined in a Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection, COM (2005) 576 final, as ‘including those physical resources, services,  and information technology facilities, networks and infrastructure assets which, if disrupted or destroyed,  would have a serious impact on the health, safety, security or economic well-being of Citizens or the effective  functioning of governments’.  5  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/policy-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-ciip  6  http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/jl0013_en.htm  7  Critical infrastructure was defined in a Green Paper on a European Programme for Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection, COM(2005) 576 final, as ‘including those physical resources, services, and  information technology facilities, networks and infrastructure assets which, if disrupted or destroyed, would  have a serious impact on the health, safety, security or economic well-being of Citizens or the effective  functioning of governments’.  Page 2  was comprehensively reviewed.8 As a result, the scope of the Directive may be extended in the  future to other sectors that rely heavily on CII and ICS.  There have been a number of initiatives by European institutions dealing with the topic of CII  Protection (CIIP). In 2009 the European Commission adopted a Communication on Critical  Information Infrastructure protection (CIIP).9 The Communication included an action plan for both  the EU Member States governments and the private sector. It was based on five pillars: (i)  preparedness and prevention, (ii) detection and response, (iii) mitigation and recovery, (iv)  international cooperation and (v) criteria for European Critical Infrastructures in the field of ICT.  Two years later another communication was published on the results achieved in meeting the  objectives of the action plan: Communication on CIIP on ‘Achievements and next steps: towards  global cyber-security’.10 The European Commission took stock of the results achieved so far and  announced follow-up actions. This Communication concluded that purely national approaches to  tackling security and resilience challenges are not sufficient, and that Europe should continue its  efforts to build a coherent and cooperative approach across the EU.  In its Conclusions on CIIP11 of 27 May 2011, the Council of the European Union stressed, among  other things, the need to foster cooperation among Member States by developing incident  cooperation mechanisms between them. In addition two ministerial conferences on CIIP were held:  in 2009 (Tallinn, Estonia)12 and in 2011 (Balatonfüred, Hungary).13 In Tallinn, the debate (‘Tallinn  process’) started on the general direction of the European efforts towards an increased network and  information security for CIIP. The conference in Balatonfüred aimed to take stock of progress made  and lessons learned (reflected in the above-mentioned Council conclusions). It also discussed ways  to engage all relevant stakeholders and in particular the private sector.  In 2012, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the European Commission's  Communication on CIIP on ‘Achievements and next steps: towards global cyber-security’.14 The  resolution included recommendations that have subsequently been incorporated into the EU Cyber  Security Strategy and into the accompanying proposal for a Directive on network and information  security.15 The EU Cyber Security Strategy explicitly mentions that the Commission and EU Member  States will ‘increase policy coordination and information sharing through the international Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection networks such as the Meridian network,16 cooperation among  competent authorities for network and information security and others’.  8  See a working document of the European Commission: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-  affairs/pdf/policies/crisis_and_terrorism/epcip_swd_2012_190_final.pdf  9  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF  10  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0163:FIN:EN:PDF  11 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/sede/dv/sede150611cccybersecurity_/se  de150611cccybersecurity_en.pdf  12  http://www.mkm.ee/eu-ministerial-conference-in-estonia-initialized-tallinn-process-to-secure-critical- information-infrastructure/  13  http://www.newspusher.com/EN/post/1302809161-2/EN-/telecom-ministerial-conference-on-ciip- balatonfured.html  14  http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P7-TA-2012- 0237&language=EN&ring=A7-2012-0167  15  http://www.eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/  16  http://www.meridian2007.org/Default.aspx  Page 3  In this strategy the European Commission asks ENISA to:   Assist the EU Member States in developing strong national cyber resilience capabilities,  notably by building expertise on security and resilience of industrial control systems,  transport and energy infrastructure;   Examine in 2013 the feasibility of Computer Security Incident Response Team(s) for  Industrial Control Systems (ICS-CSIRTs) for the EU (the task that lead to the development of  this guide).17  The overall EU policy on CIIP has resulted in a number of concrete achievements. As a follow-up to  the Communication on CIIP (see footnote 9), the European Forum for Member States and the  European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience18 were established. In addition, two pan- European cyber exercises (Cyber Europe 201019 and 201220) and one EU–US cyber exercise (Cyber  Atlantic in 201121) have taken place. The objective of these exercises was to trigger communication  and collaboration between EU Member States when responding to large-scale attacks affecting CII.  In 2010 ENISA published a minimum set of baseline capabilities and related policy recommendations  for National/ Governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) to function effectively.  In 2012, ENISA took stock of the progress made and updated policy recommendations.22  In recent years ENISA has researched several issues related to CIIP, with an emphasis on improving  the protection and resilience of ICS. In December 2011, it published a report ‘Protecting Industrial  Control Systems: Recommendations for Europe and Member States’,23 with extensive analysis of  the ICS protection in Europe and beyond. It also includes ICS security standards and guidelines  (Annex III) as well as a list of initiatives in ICS security (Annex IV).  EU Member States have also made progress in adopting national cyber-security and CIIP strategies.  Usually, the national cyber-security strategy deals with CIIP issues,24 while a separate strategy is less  common. Germany is an example of a Member State that has both a ‘general’ cyber security strategy  and a strategy on CIIP.25  17  This task is in fact analogous to earlier work by ENISA in the area of baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs  18  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ep3r  19  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber- europe/ce2010/ce2010report  20  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-europe/cyber- europe-2012/cyber-europe-2012-key-findings-report-1  21  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cyber-atlantic/cyber- atlantic-2011  22  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  23  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems  24  ENISA maintains a selection of national cyber-security strategies at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/national-cyber-security-strategies-ncsss/national- cyber-security-strategies-in-the-world.  25  http://www.bmi.bund.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/598732/publicationFile/34423/kritis_englisch.pdf  Page 4  2 Recognised practices for ICS-CERC  As ICSs become increasingly interconnected and thus more vulnerable to and a greater target of  cyber-attacks,26  it is also becoming more important that ICS computer emergency response  capability (ICS-CERC) is in place to counter these threats. ICS-CERC can be developed and offered by  many different entities, including CERTs, governmental organisations, non-governmental  organisations and private corporations. Incident handling is a core ICS capability that must be  provided by any such actor, but the specific nature of the ICS cyber-security arena means that teams  with ICS-CERC will often also serve other functions such as sharing and distributing information  about ICS cyber-security incidents or collecting statistics about ICS incidents.  The challenges in developing these capabilities have many similarities to those faced in the broader  ICT environment, but also key differences can be observed.27 ICS-CERC have to be built up with those  differences in mind. Still, the overlap between the capabilities needed for responding to ICS cyber- incidents and ICT cyber-incidents means that the experiences and best practices of well-established  CERT teams can serve as a valuable resource for the development of ICS-CERC.  ICS-CERC may require different resources and objectives, but they will have a common need to be  built up based on good common practices from ‘normal’ CERT work.  ICS-CERC can be built up based on four main elements as explained below, which are in line with the  baseline capabilities scheme28:  Table 1: Elements of ICS-CERC  Element Description  (1) Formal Capabilities  (Mandate, role and  responsibilities)  Covers the necessary processes and procedures concerning the functions,  roles and responsibilities of actors as the ICS-CERC is being developed,  what the mandate should include, how long the mandate should last, and  why a mandate is important and needed.  (2) Operational  Capabilities – Technical  Concerns the services and activities that an entity with ICS-CERC  responsibilities should develop, the follow-up steps to developing these  services, the investment required in terms of time and resources, and  specifically how to develop incident response capabilities.  (3) Operational  Capabilities –  Organisational  Includes a working regime for entities providing ICS-CERC, developing the  necessary internal expertise for ICS cyber-security, and training  programmes and policies.  (4) Cooperation and  Capabilities  Addresses stakeholders which the entities providing ICS-CERC should seek  to cooperate with as the capability is being established and thereafter;  describes why cooperation is necessary, and how to approach potential  partners.  26  It is important to note that even systems that are not connected to external networks can be targets of  attack.  27  By ICT environment, this document is referring to computers, computer networks, and other  communications systems, but without a specific focus such as industrial control systems.  28  ENISA, Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs (2009); Deployment of Baseline Capabilities  of National /Governmental CERTs: Status Report, 2012  Page 5  Figure 1: Four main groups of CERC capabilities in ICS  Overview of Development of  ICS-CERC  Formal capability  Operational capability: technical  Operational capability: organisational  Cooperation capability  Source of ICS-CERC Responsibilities  ICS-CERC team  Page 6  2.1 Mandate considerations for ICS-CERC  A mandate for building ICS-CERC must clearly and fully cover functions, roles and responsibilities  that fall under the four groups of ICS-CERC depicted in Figure 1. A mandate should take the nature of  ICS cyber-incidents into account while respecting and ideally complementing a country's existing  cyber-security structures and legislation.  2.1.1 Industrial Control Systems versus Information Communications Technology  ICS and ICT cyber-incidents can have different characteristics that should be taken into account as  ICS-CERC services are being developed. As a fundamental matter, system performance (availability),  confidentiality and data integrity are generally regarded as primary goals in the ICT world. Human  and environmental safety are major considerations for ICS cyber-security providers due to the  nature of the processes being controlled, although system availability and data and system integrity  are also important.29  Furthermore, while cyber-attacks on both industrial control systems and ICT infrastructures can have  significant and damaging consequences, industrial control systems are commonly associated with  specific critical infrastructure sectors. The EC's 2008 Directive on European Critical Infrastructures  establishes a procedure for identifying and designating European Critical Infrastructures and an  approach for improving their protection.30 As a result, ICS cyber-security can become more critical  given the potential of many ICS cyber-security incidents to have a major impact outside of the ICT  domain; for example, a cyber-attack on a power plant's control systems could cause a number of  possible safety and health issues, whereas an ICT cyber-attack would be less likely to cause such  issues (although it may do so depending on the sector attacked).  ICS responsibilities should be developed taking into account a number of factors that can distinguish  ICS cyber-security efforts from traditional CERT capabilities, although it should be recognised that  cyber-attacks on ICT can also cause significant harm and require development of robust capabilities:  Table 2: Distinguishing characteristics of providing ICS-CERC31  Distinguishing Characteristic Example  Impact on supply chains, broader  economy;  ICS cyber-attacks are more likely to cause significant damage  due to the nature of the sectors where control systems are  found. For example, a cyber-attack that takes an electrical  power station offline, even for a limited amount of time, could  29  See Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Recommendations of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce, 2011 (available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-82/SP800-82-final.pdf)  30  See Directive on European Critical Infrastructures, 2008 (available at http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:345:0075:0082:EN:PDF)  31  See Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, Recommendations of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce, 2011 (available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-82/SP800-82-final.pdf)  CERT respondent: \"The very fact that the incident affects ICS and critical information  infrastructure makes the incident severe and attaches high priority to its handling.\"  Page 7  cause significant economic damage and create the potential for  injury and/or loss of life.  Challenge of building ICS  expertise and knowledge  Developing ICS-CERC requires attention to specific devices,  protocols, and network infrastructures that may not be  required for traditional CERTs. Further, cyber-security issues  impacting control systems are more likely than broader ICT  cyber-security issues to affect a specific sector, which makes it  more challenging for ICS stakeholders to build up expertise and  knowledge.  Challenge of finding qualified ICS  employees  The fact that ICS cyber-security is often tied to a specific sector  of CII can make it more challenging to find suitable and  experienced staff for CERTs providing protection of ICS-CERC  than for traditional CERTs, which are based more on general  principles and skills.  ICS can involve extremely  sensitive information  The sensitivity of information pertaining to ICS can make  vendors and other ICS stakeholders less willing to share  information about ICS cyber-security incidents, which in turn  can make it more challenging to provide ICS-CERC services.  ICS cyber-security infrastructure  is less developed than for ICT  There have been significant efforts to develop best practices  across the ICT sector, ranging from transnational efforts such as  FIRST to regional efforts such as Trusted Introducer or ENISA to  national-level national / governmental CERTs. A number of  organisations which are dedicated to improving ICT cyber- security exist, including sector-specific groups and ICS players  such as US ICS-CERT, but such efforts are not as common or are  in the early stages when it comes to ICS-CERC.  The process for building up ICS-CERC must take these factors into account, and these factors serve as  the basis for managing a mandate.  2.1.2 Obtaining a mandate  A mandate should provide the basis for understanding what a team's responsibilities are when it  comes to ICS-CERC. Having a clear mandate is fundamental for providers of ICS-CERC to gain the  trust of constituents and other ICS stakeholders. This is particularly important in the ICS context for  establishing the necessary levels of public-private cooperation (e.g., overcoming ICS vendors'  hesitancy to share information with providers of ICS-CERC services due to their concerns about legal  liability for improperly disclosing information).  A number of factors must be taken into account while creating a proper mandate:  CERT respondent: \"Despite bearing a lot of similarities with traditional IT systems, there  are special ICS features … relating to a) network infrastructure; b) protocols; [and] c)  devices. Ordinary CERTs do not possess the knowledge of how the infrastructures of ICS  networks are organised, or how the protocols and devices work.\"  Page 8   A country's current cyber-security strategy (develop ICS-CERC in line with this)   The mandate of the country's national / governmental CERT (develop the mandate  advantageous to the development of ICS-CERC)   Other existing regulations and communications regarding CIIP (proceed in line with  European and national legislation in this area)   The scope of mandates for teams already exercising ICS-CERC (learn from existing examples  both in and outside Europe)   The views of ICS stakeholders who will be part of the constituency regarding the scope of  the mandate (engage these players while defining the mandate)  Consideration of the above-mentioned factors should help to ensure that an ICS-CERC mandate  matches the needs of the constituency and the ICS community as a whole, and helps the CERT  providing ISC-CERC services to establish and gain trust and legitimacy with both its constituency and  other relevant institutions such as its government and the CERT community.  As mentioned before: ICS is a specific area with unique challenges, and it will be not easy for ICS- CERC to be developed in a way that meets the expectations of the organisations responsible for their  development, of government, and of constituents. This suggests that ICS-CERC in a team should be  developed with simplicity and directness in mind (“start small, think big”).  Figure 2: ICS-CERC mandate considerations  Unfortunately, there are relatively few existing teams providing ICS-CERC services with publicly  available mandates for use as a reference. ICS-CERT in the United States is one prominent example  of a CERT that has been established to handle ICS cyber-security issues and has taken the lead in  publishing best practices related to developing ICS-CERC.  A number of European CERT organisations have (to some extent) developed ICS-CERC and provide  ICS cyber-security services to their constituents, including:   CERT-FI (Finland),32 which has an informal mandate in the area of industrial control systems  cyber-security issues, and is hosted by FICORA, the Finnish national regulatory authority;   Danish govCERT (Denmark),33 which also has an informal mandate in the area of ICS cyber- security issues as an n/g CERT;  32  See http://www.ficora.fi/en/  • Expectations •Resources • Formal Processes and Mandate  Government / Host  Organisation  ConstituencyTeam Responsible for ICS- CERC  •Uncertainty about Scope (Roles  and Responsibilities) • Lack of Trust • Lack of Recognition of Capabilities  Page 9   Federal Office for Information Security (Germany),34 which has a formal mandate in the  area of ICS cyber-security granted to it by the German Parliament.   CERT-PT (Portugal),35 which provides some ICS-CERC services to its constituency despite  having no formal mandate.  2.1.3 Range of the mandate  The range of the mandate for CERTs with ICS responsibilities also needs to be determined is the  focus global, pan-European, regional, national or sectorial? ICS-CERC can be valuable at any of these  levels. Each type of range has advantages and disadvantages:  Table 3: Potential range of ICS-CERC mandates  Range Advantages Disadvantages  Sectorial Capabilities will serve sector-specific  ICS stakeholders, and can easily  develop into a forum for sharing of  information and best practices given  the constituency's common interests.  Can be more challenging to manage  without a geographic component to  the range; ICS stakeholders from  different countries face different  regulatory and legal environments;  linguistic challenges can also arise.  National ICS players from the same country  will face common regulatory and legal  environments; the focus on a single  market makes it easier to focus on  what types of ICS-CERC need to be  developed.  ICS players might have little in  common and little reason to  cooperate besides sharing a common  country; a national span makes it  more important that the right entity  is providing ICS-CERC to avoid political  and other wrangling.  Regional / Pan- European  ICS-CERC with a regional focus can  create synergies and facilitate  information sharing across EU  Member States; this can be positive  for providing training, harnessing  greater resources and providing  services such as the gathering of  statistics. The experience of  institutions such as ENISA can also be  leveraged to good effect. Further,  private providers (companies)  offering services in this area typically  operate across borders in different  countries, so cross-border incident  management could be easier to  implement from a practical  perspective.  Regional-level CERTs with ICS  responsibilities face challenges from  different legal and governmental  systems, which can make cooperation  harder to achieve; ICS players might  be more hesitant about sharing  information in regional forums than in  a national forum where there is clear  responsibility for information  security. Further, national  governments often exert authority  over CII, which can make it more  challenging to establish effective  regional or pan-European incident  response capabilities for the ICS  cyber-security arena.  Global Global-level mandates for CERTs with Global-level mandates can create  33  See http://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/CFCSDocuments/rfc2350_govcert.pdf  34  See https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN  35  See http://www.cert.pt  Page 10  ICSCERC responsibilities can create  synergies, facilitate the sharing of  good practices and information across  the widest possible group of ICS  stakeholders, and in principle offer  access to greater resources, although  obtaining those resources may still be  challenging.  issues associated with regulatory and  legal frameworks CERC. Furthermore  national governments often exert  authority over CII, which can make it  more challenging to establish  effective global incident response  capabilities for the ICS cyber-security  arena.  European CERT teams surveyed for the purpose of this document expressed a slight preference for  mandate ranges of either national or sectorial level:  Figure 3: Preferred range for ICS-CERC, survey results  Number of answers=6 (Q: What is the optimal range of ICS-CERC?) (Graph shows results from survey asking  European CERT actors with ICS-CERC responsibilities what in their opinion is the preferable range for a mandate  in the field of ICS-CERC services)  It is worth considering whether dedicated ICS-CERTs should be created at Member State or EU level.  The advantages of these types of state- or EU-level incident response capabilities dedicated to ICS  cyber-security issues are clear: a state- or EU-level mandate would provide the chance for an  organisation to develop ICS-CERC at a high level and establish a national-level (or higher)  constituency. Available resources are a consideration for whether it makes sense to provide a  mandate for developing ICS-CERC at these levels; if resources are limited, it may not be easy to  argue persuasively for separating out a dedicated ICS-CERT instead of positioning it within a Member  State or EU-level body with existing (traditional) CERT capabilities.  2.1.4 Defining the constituency  The constituency is the overall customer base to which a team with ICS incident response  responsibilities provides its services. Ideally, the constituency should be defined as precisely as  possible.  Within the ICS ecosystem, there are a number of types of players which are at the core of ensuring  ICS cyber-security efforts, which should be considered when determining the constituency. A  mandate can require ICS-CERC services to be provided to several types of stakeholders, including:  50%  17%  33%  State  Regional  Sectorial  Page 11   Public ICS stakeholders: ICS-CERC services will be offered to governmental bodies (assets  owners), whether at a national level (e.g. national security) or more localised level (e.g.  operations of specific plants). Generally, public institutions will be more open to  cooperation with teams charged with developing ICS-CERC, and are likely to take a more  cooperative approach. Stakeholders from public sector are at the heart of the ICS cyber- security ecosystem because many sectors with control systems fall within the public sphere  and a government usually has a great interest in protection of its national CII.   Private ICS stakeholders: Private ICS stakeholders play an important role in the broader ICS  cyber-security ecosystem in terms of incident handling. ICS-CERC services will need to be  offered to companies (e.g. assets providers), so teams responsible for CERC providing them  will have to invest more in relationship- and trust-building with these stakeholders, as they  are usually more hesitant to share information or to report ICS cyber-security incidents. In  order to reflect legal obligation for private stakeholders to cooperate with teams with ICS  responsibilities, reporting of incidents needs to be formally defined in the mandate.   ICS vendors: (also part of the private ICS stakeholders, but due to their special role singled  out in the considerations) ICS-CERC services will have to be offered to the companies that  sell, install and maintain industrial control systems. These actors may even have their own  ICS-CERC developed and therefore may be particularly reluctant to cooperate with other  entities offering ICS-CERC services. ICS vendors are especially key constituents for teams  with ICS-CERC responsibilities because of their important roles in terms of providing asset  owners and providers with service-level agreements (SLA), vulnerability patches, updates,  and upgrades of systems.  Teams offering ICS-CERC services may decide to limit them to constituents of a certain sector or to a  particular company's customers. If the scope of a mandate is limited in such a way then it is  important that it covers all the key players (public actors, private actors, ICS vendors) within that  sector. Likewise, care should be taken that a mandate is not too broad as to make the constituency  completely unwieldy. When a mandate covers multiple or all CII sectors, it should be also considered  how to involve all stakeholders from all of these sectors in defining the mandate and considering the  services and role of the team with ICS-CERC. This is particularly challenging due to the different  nature of sectors (for example “energy” and “health”).  2.1.5 Seeking input for mandate  Teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC services need to investigate to third parties for input  regarding their mandates and development of capabilities. As mentioned, there are still very few  organisations offering ICS-CERC services or ICS best practices in comparison to more general, CERC  traditional CERTs, but input from other parties is invaluable.  There are a number of organisations with worldwide, European, national or sectorial scope that  could offer input to a team seeking to develop ICS-CERC services. These include36:   CIGRE: A global organisation dedicated to the exchange of information and best practices  about power stations.37   International Atomic Energy Agency: The IAEA offers meetings and good practices related to  the security of nuclear energy facilities.38  36  For an extensive list of ICS security-related initiatives see the Annex IV of ENISA report ‘Protecting Industrial  Control Systems: Recommendations for Europe and Member States’,  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems/annex-iv  37  See http://www.cigre.org/What-is-CIGRE/Activities  Page 12   ENISA: The European Network and Information Security Agency provides a variety of best  practices regarding ICS cyber-security as well as recommendations and good practices for  establishing incident response capabilities in Europe.39   ESCoRTS: The European Network for Security of Control and Real Time Systems aims to  foster progress towards cyber-security of industrial control systems in Europe by assisting  the EU as a whole (e.g. authorities, industry, manufacturers, etc.) in developing informed  positions and in shaping current and future efforts related to control systems security  standardisation.40   European Network for Cyber Security: The ENCS is a cooperative association that creates and  brings together knowledge and resources to secure European critical infrastructures.41 42   ICS-CERT: The US ICS-CERT is widely regarded as the leading dedicated ICS-CERT worldwide,  and offers a variety of resources including good practices and training materials, as well as  significant experience in providing ICS-CERC to its constituency.43   Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure: The United Kingdom's CPNI provides  protective security advice and advice for security planning.44   US Department of Energy: The United States' DoE offers a variety of documents and good  practices for ICS-CERC.45   US Department of Homeland Security: The DHS provides recommended practices with  regard to ICS security and is the host organisation for US ICS-CERT.46   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers: The IEEE produces a significant amount of  literature on engineering-related topics.47  All of these organisations could be sources for teams charged with developing ICS-CERC services as  they try to establish a mandate and promote their CERC services to their constituencies  2.1.6 Importance of mandate  The current practice in Europe is that national / governmental CERTs responsible for providing ICS- CERC services are not given a formal mandate. Instead, they are often provided with a broader  mandate that covers all of their activities (including ICS-CERC services) to the extent that they are  “expected to develop” the capabilities. This may reflect the extent to which ICS-CERC services are  still viewed as just an extension of these n/g CERT teams' core responsibilities, rather than as an area  which requires the development of a separate group of capabilities.48  This approach may work for some teams’ CERC, but it can also create challenges for them if their  CERC mandate is not specific enough to support cooperation between them and their private sector  constituents. This could be especially challenging for teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC  when an existing entity already provides ICS-CERC services. This may occur if an entity plays a larger  role in cyber-security in the country and has also other responsibilities. In particular, mandatory  38  See http://www.iaea.org  39  See http://www.enisa.europa.eu  40  See ESCoRTS, Security Control and Realtime Systems, Survey of Existing Methods, Procedures, and  Guidelines, available at http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/ISSS/Focus/Documents/D21.pdf  41  See https://www.encs.eu/  42  See https://www.encs.eu/  43  See http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/  44  See http://www.cpni.gov.uk/  45  See http://www.doe.gov  46  See http://www.dhs.gov/  47  See http:www.computer.org  48  Analysis based on the survey conducted to provide input into this document.  Page 13  reporting requirements to such entities may conflict with the more voluntary model of cooperation  favoured by teams with ICS-CERC, especially with private actors and ICS vendors.  As discussed previously in this study, the nature of ICS cyber-security threats and the potential  reluctance of private-sector ICS players and vendors to cooperate with teams with ICS-CERC make  establishing a baseline supporting cooperation especially important. Thus, a team charged with  developing ICS-CERC services that does not have a clear mandate may struggle to achieve trust,  legitimacy and cooperation with key ICS stakeholders.  In the longer run, having a formal mandate for ICS-related activities will benefit teams because it will  offer a clear and specific commitment to their responsibilities and how they should interact with the  various ICS stakeholders. In addition, having a formal mandate means having formal legislative and  legal support for the activities of a team with ICS responsibility. In turn, with formal processes in  place that must be respected, ICS-CERC services must be developed within certain guidelines. The  increasing prominence of ICS cyber-security matters will make it more worthwhile to ensure that  teams with ICS responsibilities have a clear mandate for these activities and the necessary support  and tools to carry them out.  Page 14  2.2 ICS operational capabilities: Technical considerations  When building up operational capability, one main challenge is to determine, to which ICS-CERC  services are suitable for the constituency. This decision must be supported by a good understanding  of the constituency size, type of services which could be delivered, resources available, and, last but  not least, the scope of the mandate.  Services provided in the initial stage of such a development of ICS incident response capabilities will  depend on a number of factors, including:   The mandate and mission;   Available resources (human and financial);   Size and scope of the constituency and its needs;   The current services provided by the team outside the ICS constituency (synergies).49  Current practice shows that teams aiming at establishing ICS-CERC services typically provide several  other CERT services as well: reactive services, proactive services, and management services with a  focus on incident handling, vulnerability coordination, raising awareness among constituents, and  training.50  Figure 4: Services portfolio for ICS constituency  Within these categories of services, teams can offer any number of more specific ICS-related  services. For example, US ICS-CERT provides four core areas of functionality to its constituents:  49  Valid only if the CERT is already mandated with building ICS incident response capability.  50  Results of survey of European CERT players carried out in conjunction with this document, asking those with  ICS-CERCs about the specific types of ICS services they offer to their ICS constituencies.  Team with ICS-CERC  Incident Handling Vulnerability  Coordination  Awareness Raising Other Services  Page 15  Figure 5: US ICS-CERT service offering51  In 2013 JP-CERT, which was charged with building ICS incident response responsibilities recently,  provides three ICS-related services: incident handling support, vulnerability coordination and  awareness raising for ICS assets owners.52 The team intends to improve its incident handling  capabilities and is considering providing on-site and off-site services to ICS asset owners in the  future.  Figure 6: JP-CERT ICS service offering53  Interestingly, current practice in Europe shows that teams with ICS-CERC responsibility do not  universally provide either incident response service or vulnerability assessments for ICS, even though  these are generally considered to be core services of any CERT team.54 On the other hand, many of  these teams with ICS-CERC provide more ‘passive’ services such as issuing alerts, incident  coordination, and technology watch. This may reflect strategic decisions by these teams to establish  themselves by first developing their capabilities in easier-to-provide services or it may suggest that  these teams have limited resources (financial and personnel).  51  ICS-CERT Year in Review, 2012, U.S. ICS-CERT, at p. 3  52  See http://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/cs/controlsystemsecurity.html  53  See http://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/cs/controlsystemsecurity.html  54  Analysis based on survey conducted in conjunction with this report  Alerts and Advisories  Incident Response Services  Conducting Technical Analysis of  Malware, etc.  Coordinating, Monitoring  Vulnerabilities  Incident Handling  Services  Vulnerability  Coordination Awareness Raising  Page 16  Figure 7: Services provided by CERT respondents providing ICS services  Number of answers=6  Q: What services, if any, do you provide in relation to ICS?  It is crucial that the teams with ICS responsibilities  decide on offering services only after having  discussed with their constituents (ICS providers/asset owners) and ICS vendors (see also section 2.4  on cooperation). At the moment it is problematic that IT security vendors often have insufficient  understanding of ICS environments when they are trying to sell their products. According to ICS  security experts, vendors often try to apply security designed for protecting data in a traditional ICT  network, which has many aspects not applying to a network of ICS devices. For example, in the ICT  network environment a malware-infected computer is often simply taken off the network. The same  approach in an ICS environment could potentially lead to a catastrophe in a power plant,  manufacturing facility or oil and gas pipeline. Therefore, SLAs must be given a strong priority with  regard to vendors.55  2.2.1 CERT services to develop good technical capabilities for ICS  Even after taking into account the differences between ICS and ICT, teams developing ICS-CERC still  have to decide what services they will provide to their constituency. This section provides a brief  overview of some of the services that are and can be provided in the ICS area. It also explains how  the nature of ICS cyber-security influences these services, and looks at current practices from  existing teams to deliver services in ICS area.  55  For more information see the article ‘IT security vendors seen as clueless on industrial control systems‘  (http://www.csoonline.com/article/733873/it-security-vendors-seen-as-clueless-on-industrial-control- systems)  0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%  Alerts/Warnings  Incident Coordination  Technology Watch  Incident Response  Announcements  Advisory Distribution  Education and Awareness  Vulnerability Assessments  Security Audits  Penetration Testing  Page 17  2.2.1.1 Incident handling  Incident handling is a core service that every CERT must provide, and should also be considered a  core service in the ICS area, even though incident handling services in the ICS context are often  challenging to develop (as mentioned before). Some reasons for this being a challenging task include  for example the difference in type and priority of incidents, different standards and procedures to  deal with and manage them, the type and size of the network and (national, regional or global)  distributed network nodes (ICS objects).  Often ICS-networks are autonomous, completely separated or stand-alone, sometimes distributed  systems across the network (with different ICS/security solutions and vendors), following different  legal regulations, policies and strategies across the national borders. In addition, what counts as an  incident handling service can be perceived differently by different actors, e.g. as incident response,  coordination, on-site support, or advisory services. There are also other aspects to consider while  deploying ICS-CERC as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter: the scope of the mandate and  current services provided by the existing team or requirements for the personnel.  There are several problems that can arise in the context of incident handling that can be specific to  the ICS arena, and in particular tend to affect parties' willingness and ability to share information  with a team responsible for incident handling in this area:   Concerning ICS vendors: obtaining timely information about ICS incidents, vulnerabilities  and patches could be challenging if it is not clearly defined in SLAs for specific ICS products;   Concerning ICS providers /ISPs: ICS cyber-security incidents are sometimes not discovered in  a timely manner due to providers' lack of proper security detection capacity;   Concerning ICS asset owners: there could be a lack of trust or willingness to cooperate  especially if the team’s responsibilities (mandate) are not clearly identified (e.g. necessity of  reporting incidents in CII area).  There is broad agreement that there is not yet sufficient sharing of information about ICS cyber- security events. Still there does not seem to be significant support for mandatory reporting of ICS  incidents affecting critical infrastructure by ICS providers (or other actors) to governments or other  entities with ICS-CERC responsibilities. This makes it more complicated to carry out ICS-CERC  responsibilities, and should be taken into account by teams trying to develop strategies for  deploying their capabilities with these players.  The problem of encouraging parties to share information makes it more important that teams with  ICS responsibilities know which parties to turn to when handling incidents:   CERTs offer advisories about emerging security risks or about incidents seen elsewhere56;   Vendors offer security patches and updates, and are good resources for general information  about ICS technologies and equipment;   ICS Asset owners should be involved in discussions about how to improve their business  models, which includes taking into account obtaining ICS cyber-security services;   ICS Service providers/ISPs should share information about network outages and cyber- security incidents and can help minimise the impact of these incidents to the extent  possible;   Other teams with ICS-CERC can be valuable in terms of obtaining information about  challenges they have faced and best practices, as well as potential cooperation in terms of  responding to a particular incident.  56  In Europe provided for example by CERT-FI or CERT-BUND.  Page 18  Teams with ICS-CERC responsibilities need to take on the challenge of growing into a trusted partner  to these other types of players when it comes to the incident handling service provision. Reluctance  to share information about incidents will be a constant challenge for any team mandated with ICS  incident response capabilities.  The incident handling process should involve as many of the parties discussed above as possible,  including ICS vendors, operators, and service providers, as well as the impacted party and the ICS- CERC team. Because of the challenges involved with incident handling, it is an area in which teams  with ICS-CERC responsibilities can demonstrate their value, importance and experience to their  constituents. Thus, it is very important that they develop strong and consistent incident handling  capability in the area!  As mentioned previously, ICS incident handling service could encompass a number of actions:   Providing technical support to the victim of an attack;   Guiding the attack victim to recovery;   Developing a process for protection in the event of similar future attacks;   Alerting other potential attack targets without disclosing confidential information;   Assessing and relating the incident to other events (with the help of authorities).  Another challenge teams with ICS CERC responsibilities face is that some ICS asset owners do not  have well defined cyber-security incident response processes in place.  Incident Detection  An initial task for teams responsible for providing incident handling service is to acquire information  about an on-going cyber-incident affecting an industrial control system. There is usually no legal  responsibility for ICS asset owners, vendors, or network service providers to report incidents, and  these players may not be comfortable with sharing this information.  This makes it important for the teams with ICS responsibilities to demonstrate trustworthiness and  transparency and instil confidence in their abilities to handle data and information with sufficient  confidentiality.  There are a number of steps that can be taken to make it less burdensome for the players to share  information.  Respondent from the ICS sector: \"The main hindrance [to effective incident handling] is  the possibility of being heavily penalized for disclosing such information, which results in  loss of credibility and value for the company. The way to overcome this would be to  establish a non-governmental (CERT) entity dealing with ICS incidents.\"  CERT respondent: \"It is important that ICS vendors, operators, and ISPs are all involved in  the incident handling process. Vendors often do not disclose all information, although  they have to provide patches and work on mitigation of the incident. Operators tend to  ask CERTs for assistance. Therefore, CERTs are perfectly fit to act as an intermediary and  coordinator of incident handling management.\"  Page 19   Incident detection services (on the site of asset provider): Incident detection is usually  within the responsibility of the ICS asset provider. The incident detection infrastructure  should be in place on site of these stakeholders. A team with ICS responsibilities can provide  advice about the security settings (risk assessments, if needed, for example)   Incident verification: A team with ICS-CERC needs to be able to verify that an incident is on- going by discussing it with the reporting party and through data analysis. Current practice is  to use various means of communicating with other players, including SSL-protected  websites, PGP-encrypted emails and telephone calls.57   Acquiring data: It is important that teams offering ICS-CERC services have the correct and  complete set of data about an ICS cyber-security incident to respond appropriately.  Common data points that should be collected include: the type of ICS incident (accident,  virus, etc.), data about the possible attacker, the system and hardware impacted, a brief  incident description and the incident's impact. It is advisable that teams follow common  CERT incident reporting formats with adjustments for ICS incidents.   Coordination: Coordination is an important element of efforts to respond to detected ICS  incidents. Teams with ICS-CERC should coordinate with a variety of players, including: the  impacted ICS organisation, the team's own host organisation, vendors, operators, network  service providers, or relevant governmental bodies. Contact information should be regularly  checked and updated. It is also important that teams developing ICS-CERC disseminate their  contact information on a regular basis to their constituency.   Incident response tools: A team with ICS-CERC responsibility has to have the necessary tools  to handle an incident. For traditional CERTs, ENISA has grouped tools into seven functional  groups, which also make sense for ICS cyber-incident response efforts, given that  interviewees say that the processes for responding to an ICS incident are generally similar to  those for an ICT incident.58  57  The practice also shows that ICS players (providers or owners) are not very familiar with, or equipped with,  the security level of communication (e.g. PGP encryption).  58  For more information see ENISA’s Clearinghouse for Incident Handling Tools at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/chiht  Page 20  Figure 8: ICS incident handling tools59  Note: Activities related to detection of an ICS incident are usually the responsibility of the ICS provider. That is  why the teams with ICS-CERC services could have, for example, an advisory or coordination role in this regard  (it usually doesn’t have the access to the network itself.)  Incident Containment  At this stage, the teams with ICS-CERC need to take an active part in the whole process of incident  management. They especially need to assess the impact of the incident on the critical infrastructure  in the country and ensure (in collaboration with the ICS asset owner or provider) that the incident  does not spread further and avoid greater damage.  Once information about an ICS cyber-security incident has been obtained, the necessary steps must  then be taken to respond to the incident, according to the initial priority of the incident. The initial  priority has to be assigned by an ICS incident reporter such as a system administrator of a particular  industrial control system (following defined incident categorisation policy). Then, based on more  general knowledge or incident escalation procedure (e.g. other ICS providers are complaining about  identical/ similar incidents) the priority can be changed/ raised.  Containment can be especially important in the industrial control system environment because of  the special considerations associated with ICS security, including among others60:   Performance requirements: Industrial control systems are time-critical by nature in terms of  the levels of acceptable delay and jitter, which means that attacks on ICS need to be  contained as quickly as possible.   Availability requirements: ICS processes are often continuous in nature, which means that  there cannot be outages or that outages should be planned in advance.   Risk management requirements: ICS cyber-security incidents can threaten human life and  injury, endanger public health or confidence, raise regulatory compliance issues, and cause  59  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management (Section 8.9)  60  National Institute of Standards and Technology, US Department of Commerce, Guide to Industrial Control  Systems (ICS) Security, Section 3-1 (2011)  Incident Handling Tools  Proactive Audit or  Detection Tools  Evidence Gathering  at Incident Scene  Investigating  Evidence of an  Incident  Supportive Tools  for Handling  Evidence  Providing Secure  Remote Access  Recovering the  System After an  Incident  Implementing ICS-CERC  Operational  Procedures  Page 21  the loss of equipment or valuable intellectual property, all of which make containment  critical.  As a result, the necessary steps to prepare to respond to incidents must be taken. In particular,  processes and policies are needed for:   Handling evidence: The nature of ICS cyber-security incidents 61means that evidence will  have to be handled which is confidential, sensitive, or proprietary in nature. Thus,  consideration must be given about how to handle such evidence so as to not lose the  support and trust of constituents.62   Documentation: Incident response processes need to be documented properly. This is  important both for confidence and capability building, and also helps prepare records for  analysis and lessons learnt from previous cases.   Role distribution: Effectively containing an ICS incident means having well-defined roles and  responsibilities among different players that are involved and responsible for the successful  containment.  Incident Remedy  Remedial actions for an ICS cyber-security event should include mitigating the incident's short- and  longer-term impact on the affected organisation, escalating the response as necessary, and ensuring  that the right lessons are learned so that the same incident does not happen again. As with other  aspects of responding to ICS cyber-security incidents, the nature and the possible criticality of ICS  cyber-incidents should be taken into account when the incident remedy or escalation procedures are  being set up.  Mitigation is generally a core objective of remedying an incident. Impacted ICS providers mostly  escalate the incident only when it is severe enough to seriously affect their production. So the  remedy depends on several aspects, for example on the incident severity (affecting energy supplies,  transport flows or even people’s lives), criticality of the system, nature of the intrusion (large-scale  DDoS attack), etc. Incident mitigation can be a core activity that can help to both minimise an  organisation's loss and mitigate the weaknesses that the attacker exploited.  In order for this service to bring real benefits to the constituents, it is important that the necessary  arrangements are made on the part of interested stakeholders. Teams need to have in place  resources and an operational mode for responding to and mitigating the impact of ICS incidents. The  ICS providers need to have effective mechanisms and processes for incident detection and  potentially sharing of the incident data with ICS-CERC teams. The ICS vendors also have an important  role to play: to provide patches and improvements to their solutions in line with evolving nature of  cyber-attacks on ICS. As a result ICS and the infrastructure need to be configured correctly  (hardening) and access rights need to be assigned adequately.  Due to the nature and potential consequences of ICS cyber-security incidents, responses to incidents  may need to be escalated either within their host organisations (company) or to the appropriate  reporting bodies (e.g. governmental entity responsible for cyber-security over CIIP, if applicable).  The nature of threats to industrial control systems might have a huge impact on different assets.  When public safety or environmental damage is at issue, remedying the incident or preventing  61  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems/can-we-learn-from-scada-security-incidents  62  For example, it concerns evidence handling of the Indicators of Compromise (IoC).  Page 22  worse case scenarios from occurring will mean bringing other parties into the discussion. As with  other aspects of ICS cyber-security responses, this means that there must be a plan in place for  escalating the response to an incident before it causes great damage.63 64  Remedying an ICS cyber-security incident also means not allowing it to happen again. There is both  an information sharing and analytical side to this. It means having procedures in place for sharing  information about cyber-incidents, while taking into account legitimate confidentiality concerns of  ICS organisations, vendors, and other impacted players. One of the formats used for automatic  sharing of information on incidents in a unified way is OpenIOC.65  Incident Closure  Closing off an ICS cyber-incident is the last step of the incident handling process. Some aspects of  incident closure (such as artifact handling, etc.) may be difficult to provide due to lack of resources.  Even within the ‘traditional’ CERT community many national and governmental CERTs do not offer  artifact handling services.66 Thus, cooperation with the host organisation and reaching agreements  with sources of funding will be an important part of efforts to develop these specific services. The  importance of for example artifact handling services should not be underestimated, as they can help  to understand why an ICS cyber-security incident occurred (and, in consequence, prevent it from  happening again.  Other aspects of incident closure, including dissemination of ‘lessons learned’, are less resource- intensive, but still require the investment of time and manpower to be planned and implemented.  The incident closure has to be closely coordinated among teams with ICS responsibilities and ICS  providers (doing follow-up onsite modifications to their ICS like reconfiguration). ICS vendors need to  be involved after lessons have been learned, in order to upgrade and modify ICS solutions and  become more resilient to cyber threats.  It is important that teams with ICS responsibilities keep records of ICS incidents and provide periodic  summary reports. These summary reports are a valuable source for updating national cyber-security  strategies in general and strategies for critical (information) infrastructure protection in particular.  On a European level it would be useful to have overall European statistics on ICS security as well.  These could take a similar form to that used for reporting ‘Article 13’ incidents in the Member  States.67 Providing comprehensive statistics will be welcomed by ICS-CERC teams, vendors, providers  and asset owners alike, which have up to now relied mostly on reports from ICS-CERT in the US.  2.2.2 Maturity of capabilities and further improvement of operational services  Consideration should be given at an early stage as to how to improve and further develop technical  capabilities (service portfolio) once a team responsible for developing ICS-CERC is off the ground.  The shifting nature of cyber-threats facing industrial control systems necessitates this, as does the  fact that constituencies will expect more as they feel more comfortable in their cooperation.  63  One recent example of such a disaster recovery plan for critical infrastructure:  http://www.state.il.us/iema/disaster/pdf/IDRP/IDRP_AnnexH.pdf  64  Detailed information on ENISA’s work in cyber crisis management and national contingency plans is available  at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation.  65  http://www.openioc.org/  66  See conclusions of ENISA’s report on Baseline Capabilites of national/ governmental CERTs:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/status-report-2012  67  See ENISA’s Annual Incident Report 2011 report: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Page 23  Further development of ICS-CERC should consider two main areas:  1. Deepening and improving services already offered. In particular, this will mean refining and  improving the processes for handling ICS cyber-security incidents, as this is a core service to  provide.  2. Broadening the scope of services offered. Constituents will want more services as they grow  comfortable with the roles of ICS-CERC available to them, whether these services are in  areas such as providing training courses or beginning to offer specific services (e.g. artifact  handling) associated with the incident handling process.  Page 24  2.3 ICS operational capabilities: Organisational considerations  Operational considerations for teams with ICS capabilities should focus on making sure that the right  support is in place for the ICS-CERC services, including having the right personnel, providing training  that reflects the ICS environment and ensures that staff have the right skills and knowledge, and  working with the host organisation to make positioning of the ICS capabilities as beneficial as  possible.  2.3.1 When to provide services for ICS – which operational mode to choose?  As is the case for CERTs dealing with ‘traditional’ ICT systems, teams with ICS responsibilities must  consider incident handling to be a core service, to an even greater extent because ICS failures  resulting from attacks, human errors and other causes often have immediate effects on assets and  potentially lives. Examples include energy catastrophes such as oil spills, floods, leakages of  dangerous chemicals, major rail incidents, or power outages. Therefore, a 24/7 reachability regime  for incident reporting and handling is a necessity for this part of reactive services, because of the  possible critical impact of an incident occurring in the ICS environment.  However, for the other groups of services provided by CERTs (proactive services and security quality  management services68) the operating regime can be business hours only. In the case of some  services like technology watch, the operational regime could be defined and agreed in cooperation  with private companies, including ICS technology vendors.  When deciding upon the operational mode, it is important to consider whether such a model is  already in place at the team entrusted with providing ICS-CERC services or whether this will need to  be built up from scratch and with additional resources. There is also the need for ICS-CERC teams to  determine whether existing CERT IT software and solutions can be applied to ICS-related incidents.  For most of the typical CERT services this can often be the case, only for specific services like  penetration testing or reverse engineering the settings might be different.  Last but not least legal aspects have to be taken into account. This may prove the most challenging  task as protection of ICS is related to national security matters and the legislation in this area is very  specific – as is the accompanying information process, which is usually highly sensitive.  2.3.2 The right personnel for the ICS environment  Having quality staff is critical for developing and providing ICS-CERC services. Human resources  requirements will depend on factors such as mandate, constituency, available resources, regulatory  and business drivers, and operational hours. Staffing correctly means finding individuals with the  right experience and capabilities as well as reaching a size sufficient to carry out the mandate.  In terms of division of responsibilities and roles, there are different potential team sizes and divisions  of responsibilities that can be used. The structure to be used by a particular team should be based  on considerations such as its mandate, its host organisation, the services it is providing, resources  available to it, and the services that it plans to provide in the future. For example, when an incident  handling service in a particular operational mode is being offered, personnel and resources must  reflect this. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that as ICS capabilities are in the early stages of  being developed, resources and personnel may need to be distributed differently than when higher  levels of operational maturity have been reached.  There is no one solution for dividing staff’s responsibilities that will suit every team with ICS  responsibilities. As a general matter, there are additional specifications to the ordinary CERT team  68  For a detailed definition of CERT/CSIRT services see: http://www.cert.org/csirts/services.html.  Page 25  composition (e.g. for CIIP strategy and policy as well as ICS risk analysis and contingency planning),  as these are core matters where ICS-CERC are being created. Beyond this, technical expertise with  ICS skills and knowledge will be needed to ensure that incident handling and other services related  to ICS can be provided at a high level.  The general process for hiring staff for developing ICS-CERC services will be similar to that for  traditional CERTs, but the specificity of the ICS context should be kept in mind. In particular, staff for  teams with ICS-CERC responsibilities should have specialised knowledge and skills that relate to the  aspects of providing ICS cyber-security capabilities discussed previously in this document. Most  important for developing ICS-CERC will be reaching a base level of staffing either with these skills or  of individuals who are capable of obtaining the skills to provide the ICS-CERC services to be offered.  6970  The hiring process for staff on teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC is an important matter  that should be given sufficient consideration. In particular, the process should acknowledge the fact  that staff will be dealing with CII matters and helping ICS players handle incidents that have the  potential to cause significant damage. This means that staff should be vetted thoroughly during the  recruitment process, and consideration should be given to factors such as individuals’ ability to  perform under pressure and willingness to be on-call for incident handling and response at non- working hours. This is important not only for the development of ICS-CERC on a team, but also for  making sure that ICS vendors, industry players, and even governmental agencies are comfortable  working with the team as it establishes ICS-CERC services.  Pre-employment screening methods provide a good tool for the hiring process. Pre-employment  screening is a type of check that employers conduct either before they offer a candidate a job or  during the hiring process. The types of screenings include criminal background checks, credit checks,  employment history verification, education verification, and driving record checks or other specific  on-demand checking. However, this pre-employment screening should be done only for pre-selected  candidates fulfilling the main requirements: the technical knowledge and experience. In some cases  69  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller  70  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Terminal_Unit  CERT respondent: \"There are very specific knowledge domains associated with control  systems versus commodity cyber infrastructure. Not only technical, but business  knowledge as well. It is important to understand the economic drivers of an industrial  sector in order to effectively work with them to improve their cyber security.\"  CERT respondent \"Despite bearing a lot of similar characteristics with traditional IT  systems, there are special ICS features that incident handlers must be knowledgeable of.\"  Respondent from ICS sector: \"While, for example, forensics analysis is the same, ICS  incident handlers must possess the knowledge and capabilities to deal with specifics of  PLC and RCU.\"  Page 26  additional certificates might be requested (e.g. allowing access to confidential information), which  are issued by authorised bodies (usually ministries of the interior/home offices).  It must be decided whether an existing team should be commissioned with developing ICS-CERC  services or a new team should be set up for this. Staff from existing CERTs can be entrusted and  appointed, particularly for matters which are not necessarily ICS-specific, including the typical CERT  operations and capabilities related to distributing information. The use of and sharing of staff  between teams is desirable from several perspectives, including cost-saving, administrative  knowledge sharing, and building capital for the team with ICS-CERC at other organisations.  2.3.3 Training personnel for the ICS environment  Training for ICS environments should be given significant consideration, as it is a core part of efforts  to develop ICS-CERC services. The first matter to be considered is who can be offered training. Of  course, teams with ICS-CERC will need to offer sufficient training opportunities, but they should also  consider working with other members of the ICS community when it comes to training. For example,  ICS vendors, asset owners, and providers all need continual training as well to keep their staff up to  date on ICS cyber-security matters. Thus, it will often make sense for teams developing ICS-CERC  services to collaborate with these stakeholders, which creates mutual benefits.  Collaboration can be  useful in creating the type of ICS-holistic grounds for discussion that could have significant benefits  not only for the team with ICS-CERC services in developing its capabilities but also for helping to  build cooperation between it and ICS players in its market.  Beyond an ICS-specific view, teams with ICS-CERC responsibility can also consider whether  cooperation with established CERTs could be useful in providing training. The ‘traditional’ CERTs are  often better established, have longer track records of offering training to their staff and  constituents, and may have more resources. Of course, this cooperation will typically be most  fruitful in areas where ICT and ICS activities and services overlap, but CERTs may find that their staff  also benefit from building up knowledge about industrial control systems. This is especially the case  where the ICS agenda falls under one team’s responsibilities.  The specific nature of providing ICS-CERC services has to be considered, though. In particular, the  impact of ICS cyber-security incidents can differ, as discussed in this document, and the methods to  be taken to mitigate these impacts will be different as well. Moreover, the ICS technical environment  is often an autonomous, internal network, which means that cyber-security threats can show  different characteristics from conventional ICT systems and networks. There are also software- and  hardware-specific protocols that are used for ICS, and training for ICS cyber-security capabilities has  to take these specifications into account as well. These factors can make it more challenging to  provide training in the ICS area than in the traditional ICT domain.  As a result, training opportunities for staff must be constantly sought out by teams responsible for  developing ICS-CERC services, especially when resources are limited. Cooperation with CERTs and  other organisations which provide training in this area can lower the costs of the actual training, as  can virtual training programmes. For example, the SANS institute offers a number of virtual training  programmes in the ICS area, which could either be used by teams with ICS-CERC responsibility  or as  a basis for developing similar offerings.71 ENISA also provides extensive online training material for  CERTs including virtual images, handbooks and toolsets for students and lecturers.72 This training  and exercise material is provided free and can, on request by a EU Member State, be applied by  ENISA trainers.  71  See http://www.sans.org/vlive/sessions  72  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  Page 27  2.3.4 Suitable hosting organisation for ICS incident response capabilities  The host organisation has a strong influence on the development of ICS-CERC, because its power and  position in the national CIIP policies and processes can streamline measures aimed at enhancing  cyber-security. It can also allow more flexibility when dealing with incidents (e.g. escalation  procedure). It can be considered as an advantage if the host organisation of a team with ICS  responsibilities has an important position as regards planning and execution of national policies in  CIIP. This is especially true while escalating incidents, when a direct line of communication to  national bodies responsible for CIIP plays a crucial role.  Different institutions could act as hosting organisations for teams charged with developing ICS-CERC.  For capabilities aimed at the national level, n/g CERTs (or rather their host organisations) are just  one of the options available. The well-established teams with ICS responsibility are usually parts of  and/or funded by organisations with coordinating roles in national policies on CIIP (see below).  The baseline organisational needs of teams with ICS-CERC services might be similar to those of an  existing CERT, including ensuring that they receive sufficient funding from the host organisation,  have well-defined lines of responsibility and reporting, legal support, and determining whether they  can use their host organisation's experience, expertise, and resources for their effective and efficient  operation.  The teams that now exist at national level, that have ICS responsibility (for example ICS-CERT in the  US) provide interesting insights into potential ways to position those teams. US ICS-CERT's host  organisation for example is the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center  (NCCIC), which is under the auspices of the Office of Cybersecurity & Communications (CS&C), which  is embedded within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The organisational chart for the DHS, CS&C and NCCIC is shown below:  Figure 9: US DHS organisational chart73  73  Available at http://www.dhs.gov/about-national-cybersecurity-communications-integration-center  Page 28  As another example in Japan ICS cyber-security is not separated out from the responsibilities of the  n/g CERT. JP-CERT/CC operates its ICS-CERC services as an element of its ‘traditional’ duties.  JPCERT/CC (almost fully funded by METI – Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry)74 supports its  constituency with several types of ICS cyber-security services, including incident handling, ICS  product vulnerability coordination, and awareness raising.  In Europe the current practice shows that ICS-CERC services have been developed either within the  n/g CERT itself (Slovenia, Denmark) or within an organisation closely related to the n/g CERT  activities (Portugal in academic and also de facto national CERT, Germany in Federal Office for  Information Security, FORTH in Greece as a CERT). The host organisation characteristics regarded  most positively by the teams with ICS responsibilities include:   If the host organisation is not a regulator or military agency, it is easier for the teams to  develop and maintain strong trust relationships with ICS vendors, industry sectors and other  private sector organisations.   It turns out that the best collaborative relationships are voluntary, not mandatory.   It is an advantage to use reputation, experience, expertise, contacts and infrastructure of the  host organisation in cyber-security and ICS.  74  http://www.meti.go.jp/english/  CERT respondent: \"We are a government institution that does not aim at making a profit –  the industry partners appreciate this a lot.\"  Page 29  2.4 How and why to develop good cooperative incident response  capabilities for the ICS sector  2.4.1 Importance of cooperation  A cyber-incident impacting an industrial control system can have a significant negative impact not  only on the organisation itself; it can also harm national security, cause injury or death of  organisation employees or community members, damage equipment or the environment, or disrupt  supply chains. ICS information infrastructure has become more interlinked in recent years, to an  extent that ICS organisations themselves may not even be fully aware. This means that threats can  rapidly cross boundaries between organisations and even nations.75  The attacks may be intentional and targeted like the well-known Stuxnet76, a piece of malicious  software detected in 2010, which focuses specifically on Siemens software and hardware, modifying  the logics of Siemens S7 PLC microcontrollers and hiding this from the supervisory software  application/ operators. Unintentional consequences or collateral damage from other attacks (not  particularly targeted at the ICS) like worms, viruses or even simple ICS failures may, for example,  cause havoc in railway and other transport flows.77 But there are also unintentional incidents caused  within ICS organisations while for example testing new software on operational systems or  unauthorised changes to system configuration.78  This reality makes cooperation at any level crucial and indispensable for teams which have incident  response responsibility over the ICS networks. The appointed team must serve as a single point of  contact for all ICS organisations within its constituency. Further, this team should be a well-regarded  incident responder and a trusted disseminator of important information. This makes developing  trust with other similar teams and their constituencies very important, as well as cooperation  between them and other (ICS) partners such as national bodies responsible for CIIP policies and ICS  assets owners, provider and vendors. Trust is to be based on win-win aspects of collaboration, as for  the constituents it is important to instigate collaboration as an open partnership, rather than to put  in place a strict regulatory regime with sanctioning powers.  75  For more information on previous ENISA studies in the area of interdependencies see for example ‘Cyber  Security Aspects in the Maritime Sector’ (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical- infrastructure-and-services/dependencies-of-maritime-transport-to-icts), ‘Emergency Communications  Stocktaking’ (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and- services/emergency-communications-stocktaking), ‘Good Practices for Resilient Internet Interconnections’  (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/inter- x/resilience-of-interconnections) or the already mentioned ‘Protection of ICS: Recommendations for Europe  and Member States’ (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and- services/scada-industrial-control-systems)  76  Falliere, Nicolas, Murchu, Liam O and Chien, Eric.

ICS respondent: \"The high level of trust is crucial for effective incident handling.\"  Page 30  The importance of cooperation at both a domestic and international level must be recognised and  implemented at an early stage when building the capabilities. In ideal circumstances, the  cooperation links should be well defined and workable with CIIP policy bodies, law enforcement  agencies and the intelligence community to coordinate incident response efforts among federal,  regional and local governments, when necessary.  However, the priority is to establish and maintain collaborative relations with all ICS, assets owners  and vendors concerning providers within the constituency according to the service portfolio. In  addition, cooperation needs to be extended to other CERTs in order to share ICS-related security  incidents and mitigation measures.79  Including all these stakeholders will contribute to strengthening the resilience of national critical  (information) infrastructures, and thus national security, and to mitigating the impact of the ICS  incidents based on the lessons learned. Broader exchange of best practices among the teams with  ICS responsibility is necessary to improve the incident response capabilities of these systems in the  future.  2.4.2 Choosing partners for cooperation at the national level  The underlying objective and focus for teams with ICS responsibility must be to protect critical  information infrastructure and support the seamless functioning of ICS that are indispensable for  this infrastructure. It is of utmost importance to understand the difference in approaches to solving  incidents in traditional ICT systems and those affecting ICS (as laid out in this report). While for ICT  systems confidentiality and integrity might be the main concern, for ICS these factors pertain to  human safety, environmental impacts and the process itself (loss of equipment/ production).  Therefore; availability ranks highest among the three fundamental characteristics of cyber-security  in this area. This aspect needs to be reflected in cooperation between teams with ICS-CERC and  relevant stakeholders.  The cooperation activities will often involve many actors, including governmental bodies, law  enforcement agencies (LEA), CERTs in the country, and mostly private sector companies dealing with  ICS. The cooperation with national CIIP authorities must be formally established and based on  national CIIP strategies and regulations. With private or semi-private ICS constituents the  cooperation is generally voluntary, which makes it important for the team to demonstrate  trustworthiness, reliability and operational incident response capabilities.  ICS asset owners and services providers  Cooperation and communication with ICS providers and asset owners is also crucial. Unfortunately,  lack of knowledge about a team's existence or its capabilities can make it more challenging for the  team to benefit from cooperative efforts at a domestic level with these partners. So, the first task  (much more important than in the case of other cooperative partners) is to promote awareness of  their own existence and their value proposition for the constituents.  The informal nature of cooperation and maintaining trust-based personal contacts is advisable, again  more so than in the case of other cooperative partners, based on the observed practice for effective  service delivery and a fruitful bilateral collaboration. This relates especially to on-site visits of ICS- CERC team’s personnel to ICS asset owners’ facilities (like transport control systems in railway or air  traffic, power plants, dams, chemical factories, food processing) in order for the technical personnel  to get acquainted with specific features of ICS in the constituency. Staff who maintains the systems  79  See Control Systems Security Program, ICS-CERT, available at http://ics-cert.us- cert.gov/sites/default/files/DHS_CyberSecurity_ICSCERT-FactSheet-v8.pdf  Page 31  (e.g. system administrators, PLC operators) should be educated in the more general issues of cyber- security and incident handling.  One challenge that is likely to arise is to establish a good operational incident reporting mechanism  with the ICS providers. In the short term, it will not be easy to mandate such cooperation because of  a general skepticism, lack of knowledge or trust in the team’s discreetness. The outlined cooperative  approach which is based more or less on a voluntary model (after the industry players become  aware of the ICS-CERC’s existence and especially its usefulness) is probably the best way to start. In  the longer term, teams with ICS-CERC should work with the national policymakers and ICS asset  owners and providers to discuss whether mandatory incident reporting could improve the practice  and bring any additional value to the operations.  ICS vendors  Cooperation and timely information sharing with ICS vendors is also very important. ICS vendors face  their own challenges in terms of convincing their customers of the importance of ICS cyber-security,  and have to be realistic in that their customers' interest levels in ICS cyber-security matters can  depend primarily on whether they have already been impacted by a cyber-security incident or not.  ICS vendors must focus on ensuring the security of their products and services, and it is important  that teams with ICS-CERC services understand how vendors are trying to accomplish this to improve  their cooperation and lines of communication. Vendors can do this in a number of ways, but broadly  speaking, they will try to:   Integrate security features into their devices and then help their customers maintain  security through service-level agreements (SLA);   Implement security standards (e.g. ISA/IEC-62443, formerly ISA 99) 80  and compliance  requirements (e.g. North American Electric Reliability Corporation-Critical Infrastructure  Protection (NERC-CIP) compliance requirements);   Provide best practices to their customers on how to implement security features to their  products;   Provide follow-up services to their customers, including patches and vulnerability  announcements.81  To the extent that teams with ICS-CERC capabilities can form positive relationships with vendors, this  can be beneficial to their efforts to offer quality and timely ICS services (like alerts and warnings) to  their constituency.  N/g CERTs and other CERTs  The relationship with the n/g CERT in its country is especially important – especially where ICS-CERC  services should be provided at a national level. Their activities must generally be coherent and  streamlined (complementary to each other if feasible), for example in the case of coordination of  incident management processes. It is up to the Member States to decide whether teams with ICS  responsibility should be separate entities, divisions of existing n/g CERTs or work under any other  arrangements. But as n/g CERTs are regarded as a single point of contact for other CERTs within the  boundaries of their countries and globally, it is desirable that ICS-CERC teams also join the CERT  communities. Via these platforms they will be in a better position to exchange information on  ‘general’ ICT incidents and ICS in particular as some industrial CERTs may also take part in the  activities of these platforms.  80  http://www.isa.org/autowest/pdf/Industrial-Networking-and-Security/Phinneydone.pdf.  81  Analysis based on interviews with vendors conducted in conjunction with this study.  Page 32  National bodies responsible for CIIP agenda  As ICS in sectors like energy, water treatment, transport, chemicals and others constitute a part of  critical infrastructure, it is a necessity that the team responsible for ICS area establishes and  maintains a good relationship and cooperation with all relevant bodies responsible for CIIP at  national level. This cooperation can be defined in national CIIP strategies and regulations. The  criticality of ICS requires that such cooperation can be activated as fast as possible after a serious  incident affecting ICS, and therefore critical infrastructure, is detected. Possible arrangements for  the cooperation could take a form of a cyber-security council or national crisis committee. The teams  with ICS-CERC will probably not have the main decision-making role, but should have an advisory  role, because of the incident response expertise.  Law enforcement agencies  Cooperation with law enforcement agencies (LEA) is another key domestic relationship. As the  attacks on critical infrastructure can have criminal aspects (sabotage, act of terrorism or other  hostile political motives), the police and the judiciary also need to be involved. It is necessary to bear  in mind that the information flow will probably be mostly unidirectional – from the team to LEAs as  is documented by current practice.82 On the other hand, the team should regard this cooperation as  one of its crucial partnerships due to the possible impact of ICS incidents, so the team should be a  valuable source of information and expertise for LEAs. For example, the above-mentioned Stuxnet  can be considered as a reference model, a step-by-step guideline for a future generation of malware  against ICS.  2.4.3 Cooperation at cross-border level  ICS cyber-security and threats raise specific issues touching on sensitive matters such as national  security that are less common with traditional ICT cyber-attacks. This makes information sharing  harder to achieve, especially across borders, and will in turn place a significant benefit to trust. It  needs to be said that with the interlinking of ICS across borders the complexity of cooperation and  especially legal implications increases.  Cyber-attacks on industrial control systems may easily occur across national borders and impact  organisations with operations in many different countries. The attacks include massive distributed  denial of service attacks (DDoS), efforts to penetrate networks undetected, DNS poisoning, SQL  injection attacks or malware infections. The aims of the attacks vary from shutting down services or  operations to the theft of services and data or extortion attempts. According to a study ‘In the  Crossfire: Critical Infrastructure in the Age of Cyber War’ conducted by McAfee,83 the most sensitive  82  See ENISA’s report on information sharing between CERTs and law enforcement agencies at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/supporting-fight-against- cybercrime/cooperation-between-certs-and-law-enforcement-agencies-in-the-fight-against-cybercrime-a-first- collection-of-practices/at_download/fullReport  83  http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-in-crossfire-critical-infrastructure-cyber-war.pdf  CERT respondent: \"The implementation method and placement of countermeasures or  defences may be different [for ICS-CERC teams], and the business domain may also  impose different or stricter requirements towards reliability and availability.\"  Page 33  critical infrastructures in energy and natural-resource industries (such as water and sewage plants),  are some of the least secure. Executives at water and sewage facilities also reported having the  lowest level of security measures in place.84 Especially when these facilities are located close to  national borders (for example dams and water reservoirs), incidents affecting their control systems  may have serious repercussions for critical infrastructures in more Member States. However, the  immediate geographic distance is of less importance when it comes to attacks and disruptions  relating to power plants or transport flows.  Thus, incident responses may need to be coordinated across countries or synchronised between ICS  and other actors in a number of different countries. Further, best practices for responding to and  preventing attacks on industrial control systems become less and less country-specific. These factors  favor cooperation at the cross-border level, as is also necessary when dealing with large-scale cross- border ICT incidents.  This cooperation can create efficiencies in facilitating response for teams with ICS responsibility, for  example as regards mitigation of incident impacts that sever energy supplies and cross-border high- speed railway transport. Resources of the teams providing ICS-CERC services could be limited, and  capabilities need to be built up to face challenges resulting from the attacks on ICS. This means that  best practices need to be taken note of and used, and ICS knowledge should be built as efficiently as  possible. Knowledge sharing with other existing and experienced teams and industry players is one  relatively straightforward way to accomplish this.  On an international level, there are a number of challenges to cooperation on ICS cyber-security  matters. Teams with ICS responsibility are not as widespread or as well-known as traditional CERTs,  so there is not a robust network of similar players or a wide European community in place as teams  develop their ICS-CERC. However, as pointed out earlier in this document, utilising the expertise and  experience of existing CERT communities would be beneficial for a team charged with ICS-CERC  services.  A number of organisations offer international forums or facilitate cooperation among ICS players.85  Organisations that focus on ICS security matters such as CIGRE or even broader CERT community  organisations such as FIRST and industry associations can be useful resources, and could be  important to the development of operational and effective incident response cooperation at an  international level.  84  Ibid.  85  For more information see 2.1.5 and footnote 36.  A respondent from the ICS sector noted very good cooperation within NAMUR, an  international user association in the chemical and pharmaceutical processing industries,  where information is shared among attendees.  Another respondent noted that his team is a member of FIRST and that its customers were  willing to discuss ICS-related matters with it in this forum.  Page 34  CERTs with an ICS-CERC agenda are not always members of EuroSCSiE or any other European and  global initiative dealing with ICS and its cyber-security aspects. Teams to be tasked with ICS-CERC  services could welcome such discussions and forums and should take an active part in them. Thus,  participating in international ICS forums and developing relationships with other teams could be a  fundamental part of efforts by teams with ICS-CERC to develop and to better serve their  constituents. Besides, it is recommended that such teams seek recognition among the wider CERT  community. Membership to or accreditation at FIRST or Trusted Introducer, 86  although not  specifically focused on ICS, can be a very good step to gaining recognition and acceptance by experts  in the area of incident response capabilities. Some of the industry players are already engaged in  these organisations and initiatives via their incident response teams.  At the same time, it is logical to establish mutually beneficial bilateral relations with teams in other  countries. Some of the teams that can be seen as demonstrating good practices in ICS-CERC in  Europe and beyond have been mentioned in this document. Other examples will inevitably follow as  more teams with ICS-CERC are established and attain a certain degree of maturity.  86  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/index.html  Page 35  3 Conclusions  This document provided an overview of many of the important considerations for a team charged  with developing ICS-CERC services, with a special view on incident management capabilities. As  stressed throughout the document, there are some unique challenges associated with providing  cyber-security services for industrial control systems, but the process can be made more  manageable by following identified good practices for CERTs and taking into account experiences  which exist already in Europe and globally. Information sharing and cooperative efforts are  indispensable elements of the development efforts.  The responsible team needs to bear one paradigm in mind, which is different for ICS compared to  traditional ICT systems. It is the priority aspect on the three-stranded CIA security scale:  confidentiality, integrity, availability. While for traditional ICT systems the main priority is integrity,  for ICS availability ranks highest. This has a lot to do with the fact that ICS are indispensable for the  seamless operation of critical infrastructure. Cyber-incidents affecting ICS can have disastrous effects  on country’s economy and people’s lives. They can cause long power outages, paralyse transport  nationally and internationally and cause ecological catastrophes. In order to face these challenges, it  is of utmost importance that the team is equipped with all the capabilities of a ‘typical’ well- functioning CERT but with additional adjustments for the ICS environment.  As protection of critical infrastructure (and thus of ICS) is a matter of national interest, often  embedded in national CIIP strategies and regulations, there should be a clear mandate defined,  especially for incident management activities. The main constituents will be large ICS players (energy  companies, transport companies, chemical industry, food processing), which, unlike constituents of  traditional CERTs, sometimes do not have sufficient expertise in cyber-security. On the other hand,  the established CERTs do not necessarily understand or have a deeper knowledge of sector-specific  technical aspects of ICS.  Incident handling is a core service that every CERT must provide, and should also be considered a  core service in the ICS area. Incident handling service in the ICS context will be challenging to  develop, as a result of (for example) the type and priority of incidents, different standards and  procedures to deal with and manage, the type and size of the network and (national, regional or  global) distributed network nodes (ICS objects). An initial challenge for teams responsible for  providing incident handling service is to get information about an ongoing cyber-incident impacting  an industrial control system. There is usually no legal duty for private ICS asset owners, vendors, or  network service providers to report incidents, and these players may not be comfortable sharing this  information. This makes it important that a team demonstrates trustworthiness and transparency  and builds confidence in its abilities to handle data and information with complete confidentiality.  The hiring process for staff on teams responsible for developing ICS-CERC services is an important  matter that should be given sufficient consideration. In particular, the process should acknowledge  the fact that staff will be dealing with CII matters and helping ICS players handle incidents that have  the potential to cause significant damage. This means that staff should be vetted thoroughly in the  recruitment process, and consideration should be given to factors such as an individual’s ability to  perform under pressure and willingness to be on-call for incident handling and response at non- working hours. This is important not only for the development of ICS-CERC services in a team, but  also for making sure that ICS vendors, industry players, and even governmental agencies are  comfortable working with the team as it establishes its services.  The importance of cooperation at both the domestic and international level must be recognised  and implemented when building the incident response capabilities. In ideal circumstances, the team  partners with CIIP policy bodies, law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community,  Page 36  coordinates incident response efforts among federal, regional or local involved partners, and works  with ICS asset owners, operators, and vendors on regular basis. Additionally, teams should  collaborate with other ICS players and CERTs to share ICS-related security incidents and mitigation  measures. Including all these stakeholders will contribute to strengthening the resilience of national  critical (information) infrastructures, and thus national security, and to mitigating the impact of the  ICS incidents. Broad exchange of good practices among teams with ICS responsibility is necessary for  improving incident response capabilities in the future.  Page 37  Next steps  This document needs to be considered as an initial attempt to provide a good practice guide for the  teams to be tasked with incident response capability for industrial control systems. For this reason it  is a living document that will be periodically updated in line with the evolving cyber-security  landscape and, of course, also in line with experiences of the EU Member States in deploying this  capability in their respective countries. In addition to existing activities in ICS such as providing CERT  training material, ENISA is ready to facilitate the exchange of the good practices via aggregate  reports, analysis and CERT workshops. ENISA also welcomes and encourages any suggestions of ICS  stakeholders from the public, private and non-profit sectors with the objective to improve and  update this guide.

    "abstract": "This document builds upon the current practice of CSIRTs with responsibilities for ICS networks, and also on the earlier work of ENISA on a baseline capabilities scheme for national/ governmental (n/g) CSIRTs. The document is an initial attempt to provide a good practice guide for the entities that have been tasked to provide ICS Computer Emergency Response Capabilities (ICS-CERC). On the other hand, this guide does not have the ambition to prescribe to the EU Member States which entities should be entrusted with provision of ICS-CERC services."

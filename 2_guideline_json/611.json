ENISA is recommending that Internet network providers implement long-known traffic filtering techniques,  which could have countered a major cyber incident that hit services across western Europe last Month  (March 2013) [1].  The incident was an attack mounted against the non-profit organisation Spamhaus [2], leading to  noticeable delays for internet users mostly in the UK, Germany and other parts of Western Europe.  Spamhaus, which is based in Geneva and London, contributes to the fight against spam by providing a  service that enables operators of email servers to check if a sender’s email server is known to be sending  unsolicited commercial email. Although no clear evidence exists, the attack on Spamhaus is generally  attributed to a hosting provider who was flagged as a spam sender by Spamhaus.  This incident highlights some important vulnerabilities of the internet infrastructure, but at the same time  also demonstrate its inherent resilience.  DNS Amplification and Open Resolvers  The attack on Spamhaus was dubbed by online media as the biggest Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)  attack ever seen [3]. Spamhaus started experiencing a significant DDoS attack on its servers on 16th March.  The attack spanned a period of more than one week and happened in three phases: first, the attack was  directed at Spamhaus, then at CloudFlare, a service provider contracted by Spamhaus to deal with the  attack, and finally at CloudFlare’s network providers. In this last stage of the attack, the enormous amount  of traffic generated by the attack caused problems at the London Internet Exchange.  The technique used for the DDoS attack is by no means new. The method used by the attackers to generate  the traffic directed at the Spamhaus network, DNS amplification, has been known for many years. It is  made possible by the fact that today it is still possible for most internet-connected hosts to send IP packets  with forged (“spoofed”) source addresses.  Another factor contributing to the size of the DDoS attack is the large number of so-called “open recursive  resolvers” in the internet. Open resolvers are Domain Name Service (DNS) servers which answer all  requests sent to them, not just those related to the DNS domain for which they are authoritative resolvers.  Open resolvers can be misused to amplify DDoS attacks [4].  Unfortunately, even today many network providers have not implemented a set of recommendations (called  BCP38 [5]), which has been around for almost 13 years. If the available recommendations were  implemented by all networks, traffic filtering on border routers would block such attacks. A similar set of  recommendations for operators of DNS servers (called  BCP140 [10]), which could help reduce the number  of servers that can be misused for DNS amplification attacks, was published in 2008.  However, today there are still thousands of servers that can be abused for this kind of attacks.  BGP Hijacking  At the same time as the DDoS attack, Spamhaus was also attacked using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)  route hijacking [6]. The aim of this particular attack was to hijack legitimate queries away from Spamhaus’s  servers in order to disrupt their operation and reputation reporting so that every IP address on the internet  was regarded as a source of spam [7].  1  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/  PO Box 1309, 71001 Heraklion, Greece,  Tel: +30 2810 391 280, Fax: +30 2810 391 410  www.enisa.europa.eu  Flash Note  12/04/2013  www.enisa.europa.eu  FN/02/2013  The BGP is used by network operators to exchange information about the reachability of blocks of internet  addresses. BGP hijackings can be accidental, but can also be used by attackers in various ways to disrupt or  intercept a network’s traffic, essentially by pretending to provide a faster way to reach the victim’s network.  Lessons Learned  When looking at this incident, the question arises as to how much any particular geographical area or  economic sector depends on certain network operators, internet exchanges, or physical infrastructure.  There are a number of lessons that can be learned from this incident:   While the incident didn’t affect the internet on a global scale, the effects on a local scale were rather  noticeable. It therefore serves as a reminder that while the internet overall can be considered  resilient, it cannot be taken for granted that this is also true for the local part of the Internet  infrastructure serving a particular region, or country.   Even disputes between private, non-state actors can have important effects on internet  infrastructure, due to the high degree of interconnections and the cross-border nature of the  internet.   Attacks are increasing in size. While the largest publicly reported DDoS attack up to 2012 had been  around 100 Gigabits of data per second, the March 2013 attack on Spamhaus reached a size of more  than 300 Gigabits per second [8].   At this size of attacks, the capacity of commercial internet exchanges, which normally have very high  availability/capacity infrastructure, can be exhausted.   Currently there exists no widely agreed scheme to assess the impact of the factors that played a role  in the attack, or of incidents related to the physical layer of the internet infrastructure. This makes it  difficult to assess the associated risks.  It is also interesting to note that despite the size of the DDoS attack, there is no clear evidence as to its  originators. For the BGP route hijacking, the situation is different because the corresponding route  announcements are made “in public” and were recorded [6].  Recommendations by ENISA  The interdependencies of various components forming the foundations of the internet infrastructure, such  as cables, datacentres, network operators, internet exchanges, are still not completely understood. The  recent incident shows that there are still many steps that can be taken even in the short term, to improve  the resilience of the internet infrastructure.   Operators serving as upstream or transit providers to end-customer networks should implement  BCP38 [5].   Operators of DNS servers should check whether their servers can be misused in DNS amplification  attacks and should implement BCP140 [10].   Operators of internet exchange points should consider that their infrastructure might be attacked  directly and make sure that they have appropriate security measures in place.  2  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/ http://www.enisa.europa.eu/  PO Box 1309, 71001 Heraklion, Greece,  Tel: +30 2810 391 280, Fax: +30 2810 391 410  www.enisa.europa.eu  Flash Note  12/04/2013  www.enisa.europa.eu  FN/02/2013  ENISA will continue to investigate the area of network interconnections with the aim of providing  policymakers, telecommunications regulators, cyber security agencies  and network operators in European  Union Member States with recommendations on how issues related to the resilience of the internet  infrastructure in Europe can be addressed.

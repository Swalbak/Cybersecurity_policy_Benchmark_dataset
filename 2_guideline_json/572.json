Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  E-Government services have significant potential to make public services more efficient for the  benefit of citizens and businesses in terms of time and money. And while these benefits are  increasingly being felt nationally, e-Government services still face administrative and legal barriers  on a cross-border level, although pan-European projects like STORK have shown that technical issues  of interoperability of electronic identifications can be overcome. In order to remove existing barriers  for cross-border e-ID based services the European Commission has proposed in June 2012 a draft  regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market [38], which will replace the existing Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC [37]. The main  goals of this action are to:   ensure mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders   give legal effect and mutual recognition to trust services   enhance current rules on e-signatures   provide a legal framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document  acceptability, electronic delivery and website authentication.   ensure minimal security level of trust services providers systems   enforce obligation of notifications about security incidents at trust services providers  In Article 15 of the above mentioned draft regulation the EC proposes that trust services providers  have to demonstrate due diligence, in relation to the identification of risks and adoption of  appropriate security practices, and notify competent bodies of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  In this context, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) developed  in 2013 the Guidelines for trust services providers, discussing the minimal security levels to be  maintained by the trust services providers. The study is split into three parts:  Security framework: describing the framework surrounding trust service providers (TPSs), focusing  on EU standards, but taking into account others where relevant.  Risk assessment: discussing the principles and concepts of managing the risks applicaple to TSPs by  defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents: recommending measures to mitigate the impact of  security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and organisational  means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP.  All three parts can also be used separately, as they address different issues and target different  audience, so the introductory sections overlap.  This document, Part 2: Risk Assessement, covers the following aspects:   Assets: identification, classification and evaluation   Threats to assets: classification and evaluation   Vulnerabilities present in the environment   Probability or frequency of the threat   The impact that the exposure can have on the organization   Countermeasures that can reduce the impact   The residual risk, risk acceptance, risk treatment plan, etc.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary iv  1 The concept of Trust Service Providers 1  2 Introduction to risk assessment 3  3 Risk assessments on TSPs 4  4 TSP infrastructure 5  4.1 The involved entities 5  4.2 The involved processes 6  4.3 Determine assets 7  4.4 Identify threats 10  4.5 Analyse vulnerabilities 11  4.6 Identify existing controls 17  4.7 Determine consequences 22  4.8 Identify incident scenarios 23  5 Analyse risk 25  5.1 Assess impact 25  5.2 Assess probablility 26  5.3 Estimate level of risk 27  6 Evaluate risk 29  Risk 1: Compromise of a Certification Authority 29  Risk 2: Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms 30  Risk 3: Compromise of a Registration Authority 31  Risk 4: Compromise of the revocation services 32  Risk 5: Personal data breach 33  Risk 6: Impersonation 33  Risk 7: Loss of availability of the certification services 34  Risk 8: Repudiation claim by certificate subject 35  Risk 9: Compromise of a subject’s key pair 36  Risk 10: Compromise of a Validation Authority 36  Risk 11: Compromise of a Time Stamping Authority 37  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  vi  7 Conclusions 39  Annex 1 – Definitions 40  Annex 2 – Abbreviations 42  Annex 3 – Bibliography 44  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  1  1 The concept of Trust Service Providers  A trust service provider (TSP) is a supplier facilitating electronic security services to customers. The  scope of such services includes, but is not limited to, electronic signatures and seals, electronic time  stamps, and electronic authentication. Usually, these services rely on electronic certificates issued by  certificate service providers (CSP) which is a type of TSP. For the sake of simplicity, we use the CSP as  a running example for a TSP within the document at hand. All recommendations apply analogously  to other types of TSP as well.  An electronic certificate (or certificate for short) is an electronic document that binds certain pieces  of data together and is signed by a trusted third party that vows for the binding. For example, an  attribute certificate binds an identity, such as a person, a service, or a device, to certain attributes,  such as profession or access rights. Another example is a public key certificate that binds an identity  to a public key. This certificate can then be used, amongst others, to verify the identity or signature  of the certificate holder. In order to keep things understandable, we use public key certificates as  running example throughout this document. All recommendations apply analogously to other types  of certificates as well.  Electronic certificates rely on public key cryptography. In public key cryptography, two separate  keys, mathematically linked, are provided to an entity. One of the keys is public and can be  disseminated, while the other key is private and needs to be under the sole custody of the key pair  owner. The private key cannot be derived by sole knowledge of the public key, but one key  completes the other in terms of cryptographic operations. For example, a cipher text created using  the public key can be decrypted using the private key; equally, the public key can be used to verify  signatures that were created by the private key. Because of this property of public key cryptography,  and by ensuring the secrecy of the private key and the authenticity of the public key, a relying party  can verify that an entity presenting a certificate is who it claims to be or that a signature is valid.  However, a third party is needed to ensure that the information contained in the certificate,  including the public key, is actually linked to the real identity of the entity. This is done by a TSP,  which uses its so-called certificate authority (CA) signing keys to sign the entities’ certificates. With  this operation the TSP attests that the certificate was issued to the entity whose information is  contained in it. Hence, we distinguish between two different types of certificates:   Subject certificates, also called end entity certificates, that are used for day to day tasks such  as authentication, signatures, or encryption. The holder of such a certificate is called the  subject.   CA signing certificates that are used to sign other certificates. Apart from signing subject  certificates, CA certificates are often also used to sign other CA certificates to establish a  trust relationship between CAs.  Electronic certificates can be used for a variety of purposes, some of the most common being to  support electronic signatures, electronic seals or website authentication. Electronic signatures or  seals are meant for natural persons (signatures) or legal entities (seals) to be able to produce digital  signatures on documents or messages in order to ensure:   The integrity of the document or message: attest that the document or message has not  been altered.   The authenticity and non-repudiation: attest that the document or message was produced  by the certificate owner.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  2  In the context of authentication, when an entity A presents itself to another entity B with its  electronic certificate, entity B can verify that the entity A is actually who it claims to be by checking  that entity A is in possession of the private key associated with the public key included in the  certificate.  In the case of encryption, electronic certificates can also be used to provide confidentiality. The use  of public key cryptography for the exchange of  session keys ensures the confidentiality of the  communication. Here, the session key is the entity that carries out the encryption of the messages.  The service of Certificate Service Providers can be broken down into the following component  services   Registration service: verifies the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a  subject. The results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service.   Certificate generation service: creates and signs certificates based on the identity and other  attributes verified by the registration service.   Dissemination service: disseminates certificates to subjects, and if the subject consents,  makes them available to relying parties. This service also makes available the CA's terms and  conditions, and any published policy and practice information, to subscribers and relying  parties.   Revocation management service: processes requests and reports relating to revocation to  determine the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed  through the revocation status service.   Revocation status service: provides certificate revocation status information to relying  parties. This may be based upon certificate revocation lists or a real time service which  provides status information on an individual basis. The status information may be updated  on a regular basis and hence may not reflect the current status of the certificate.  and optionally:   Subject device provision service: prepares and provides a signature-creation device to  subjects.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  3  2 Introduction to risk assessment  As the networked world continues to shape and impact every aspect of our lives, threats to the  global industry continue in parallel.  Security management ensures that the risks are identified and an adequate control environment is  established to mitigate these risks.  There is a need to manage the risks by defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities. To  achieve this, it is important to understand the principles behind the management of risk and the  concepts underlying the risk management process. These principles and concepts will be discussed  in this document. Interactions between them are depicted on Figure 1.  Figure 1 Concept of security risk management  Risk Assessment (also known as risk analysis) will evaluate:   Assets: identification, classification and evaluation   Threats to assets: classification and evaluation   Vulnerabilities present in the environment   Probability or frequency of the threat   The impact that the exposure can have on the organization   Countermeasures that can reduce the impact   The residual risk, risk acceptance, risk treatment plan, etc.  Unlike risk assessments, vulnerability assessments tend to focus on technology aspects of an  organization, such as networking or software applications. Through the use of different tools and  methodologies, these assesments can provide information on the type and severity of vulnerability.  It´s also important to identify the risk avoidance, the risk transfer which is the ability to transfer the  risk to another entity like an insurance company, the risk mitigation and the acceptance of the risk  that can be based on a business decision.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  4  3 Risk assessments on TSPs  In order to conduct a risk assessment, several methodologies exist. The goal of this report is not to  describe in detail the different existing methods, but to provide a general overview of how a risk  assessment is conducted and to identify risks specific to trust service providers that serve as a guide  to assist providers when conducting an assessment.  For the purpose of the document, the risk assessment phases defined in ISO/IEC 27005:2008  (Information technology - Security techniques - Information security risk management) [2] are  followed:   Risk identification: Identifying the different factors (assets, threats, vulnerabilities,  consequences and incident scenarios) that will identify and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  5  4 TSP infrastructure  The first step in the risk assessment process is to determine the scope included in the risk  assessment and its boundaries. The TSP shall define the entities involved in the trust services it  provides and the role of each entity.  To support the system scope delimitation process, a list of examples of common entities and  processes involved in the operations of a TSP have been produced, which can be found below. This  list is informative and should only be used as a generic reference.  4.1 The involved entities2  Certificate Authority: Certificate Authorities are entities that issue electronic certificates. TSPs  issuing electronic certificates have one or several CAs. Certificate Authorities handle the whole  certification lifecycle management process, with the exception of the registration process which is  done by the Registration Authority. Commonly, Certificate Authorities generate and maintain their  own key pair which they use to sign the certificates they issue. CAs act as a trust anchor: when a  subject presents him/her certificate to a third party, it is the signature by a trusted CA in the subject  certificate what ensures relying parties that the certificate is legitimated.  Registration Authority: The Registration Authority is the entity that verifies the certificate  requester’s identity to ensure the certificate is issued to the legitimate subject. Once the identity is  verified, the RA sends a certificate request to the CA, who will then produce an electronic certificate  and deliver it back to subject. The Registration Authority can be part of the TSP or it may be an  external entity with some type of contract or agreement with the TSP. For example, a small TSP  requiring physical presence of the subject may delegate this activity to an external CA as deploying a  whole set of physical offices may not be feasible.  Subject: The subject is the entity who owns an electronic certificate issued by the TSP. A subject can  be natural persons or legal entities. Subjects request certificates from TSPs which they use for many  different purposes, such as electronic signatures, authentication or encryption. Subjects are bound  to a certificate by the signature of the CA, who vows for their identity.  Relying party: The relying party is an entity that relies on the certificates issued by the CA to verify  the subject identity or signature validity. Relying parties can be signature validation platforms, online  services that use the digital certificates for authenticating users, browsers that validate web  authentication certificates, end users, etc.  Validation Authority: The Validation Authority (VA) is an entity that provides information on the  status of certificates to verify whether certificates are valid or not. There can be one or more VAs  connected to each CA in the PKI. The VA shall be capable of storing information on the status of the  certificates generated by one or more Certification Authorities (CAs).  The VA shall guarantee the non-repudiation of its responses. These responses are digitally-signed by  the Validation Authority and specify the date and status (valid, revoked, cancelled or unknown) of a  certificate and these results can be published e.g. via CRLs or OCSP.  Time-stamping Authority: The Time-stamping Authority (TSA) is the entity that provides a proof of  existence for a particular data set at a particular time. This is usually used to verify that a digital  signature was applied to a message for example, before the corresponding certificate was revoked  2  Further definitions can be found in ISO/IEC 13335 [1], ISO/IEC 24760 [3], ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4], RFC 3647 [23],  ETSI TS 102158 [14], ETSI TS 102042 [16], Directive 1999/93/EC [37]  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  6  thus allowing a revoked public key certificate to be used for verifying signatures created prior to the  time of revocation.  The TSA shall generate a digitally-signed time-stamp that includes the time of the request; the  information that securely binds the stamp to the electronic document; and a unique registration  number for auditing purposes.  4.2 The involved processes3  This is a list of the main processes involved in the most commonly used TSP operations. The list is  informative and should only be used as a generic reference.  The registration process: The registration process is the initial process by which the subject goes to  the registration authority to request a certificate. The subject presents a proof of identity and the RA  sends a certificate request to the CA which upon production of the certificate delivers it back to the  subject.  The key management process: The key management process comprises all the processes which are  in place to manage the key pairs of the CAs, VAs and TSAs mainly during its complete lifecycle:   The key pair generation   The key pair storage, backup and recovery   The certificate dissemination   The key pair usage   The key pair destruction   The key renewal, rekey and update   Key archive  The subject key management process: The subject key management process comprises all the  processes that are in place to manage the keys of the subject during their lifetime:   The subject key generation   The subject key device provisioning   The subject key storage, backup and recovery   The subject key renewal, rekey and update   The subject key dissemination   The subject key destruction  The subject certificate management process: The subject certificate management process  comprises all the processes that are in place to manage the subject certificate:   The subject certificate generation   The subject certificate delivery   The subject certificate renewal, rekey and update   The subject certificate dissemination  The revocation process: The revocation process comprises all actions from the revocation request to  the revocation publication in the certificate revocation status service.  3  Please also refer to the “Guidelines for trust service providers – Mitigating the impact of security incidents”  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  7  The validation process: The validation process comprises all actions from users or trust service  providers on requesting / providing the status of the digital certificates. This can be done e.g.  through:   CRL (Certificate Revocation List)   OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)  The time stamping process: The time stamping process comprises all action from users and trust  service providers that want to add time stamps to electronic documents or transactions.  The information and condition process: These processes comprise all actions to protect external  and internally the TSP infrastructure.  The operational process: These operational processes comprise all actions related to procedures  and policies established by the TSP to perform its activities.  4.3 Determine assets  In a risk assessment context, assets are what the organization needs to protect. Assets are not only  physical, tangible items that the organization can easily classify in terms of monetary value. The  information that the organization produces or gathers is an important asset as well as the trust  relationships and reputation as examples of intangible assets.  All assets shall be identified and listed. Each asset shall be assigned an owner to determine who  finally has the responsibility for the protection and maintenance of that asset.  The assets shall be categorized based on their type and characteristics.  Once assets have been identified, the next step is to determine their value, together with the asset  owner. An asset’s value can be determined based on the negative consequences an incident  affecting them may have for the organization. This can be qualitative (recommended) and  quantitative (money).  In the case of TSPs, an example of a critical asset would be the CA private key. An incident involving  the confidentiality or integrity of the CA private key could have very damaging consequences for the  TSP. For example, a malicious individual could impersonate the CA and generate fraudulent  certificates. Therefore, the value of the CA private key would certainly be estimated by any TSP as  very high. Following this approach, the TSP shall conduct an evaluation of the value of all the  identified assets.  To support the asset identification process, some examples of common assets TSPs own, are listed  below. The list is informative and should only be used as a generic reference. The TSP shall have a list  of assets and their value which corresponds to its actual business and operational environment. The  list has been organized following the guidelines provided in the ISO 27005 [2], which divides assets in  two categories:   Primary assets, which comprise the information assets and the business processes.   Supporting assets, which comprise software, hardware, network, personnel and locations.  Primary assets  Information assets: Information assets include all data that are handled by the TSP, either produced  by it or handled by third parties. In this category the TSP should include at least all the information  related to the certificates (public and private keys, certificate content, etc.) as well as all the logs of  the system (CA operation logs, OCSP logs, etc.). Examples of information assets in a TSP are:  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  8   CA certificate   CA private key   RA certificate   RA private key   VA certificate   VA private key   TSA certificate   TSA private key   Subjects’ certificates   Subjects’ private keys   Registration archives   Audit logs of the different involved entities   Certificate revocation status request logs   Certificate revocation lists  Business processes: The TSP should identify all the business processes that are conducted in the  organization. The list should include all certificate lifecycle management processes, plus any  additional processes the TSP may have depending on the additional services (validation,  preservation, etc.) that the organization is offering. Examples of business processes in a TSP are:   The registration process   The CA key pair generation   The CA key pair storage, backup and recovery   The CA certificate dissemination   The CA key pair usage   The CA private key destruction   The VA key pair generation   The VA key pair storage, backup and recovery   The VA certificate dissemination   The VA key pair usage   The VA private key destruction   The TSA key pair generation   The TSA key pair storage, backup and recovery   The TSA certificate dissemination   The TSA key pair usage   The TSA private key destruction   The subject device provisioning   The subject certificate generation and delivery to subject   The subject key pair generation   The subject certificate renewal, rekey and update   The subject certificate dissemination   The validation management process   The revocation management process   The revocation status dissemination process  These business processes have support processes that can perform additional activities that can be  also vulnerable and can affect the business processes.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  9  Supporting assets  Software, hardware and networks: The TSP shall include in the asset inventory all software  applications; all hardware infrastructures (servers, user equipment, cryptographic modules, etc.) and  all network infrastructures that are used in the TSP. Examples of software, hardware and networks  assets are:   Hardware  o CA equipment: servers for CA root and subordinates CAs  o Other CA necessary equipment, e.g. LDAP  o RA equipment: PCs, printers, etc.  o VA equipment  o TSA equipment  o Subject devices: smartcards, USB tokens, etc.  o Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)  o Web servers   Software  o CA key management applications  o CA backup applications  o Other CA applications  o RA applications  o VA management applications  o TSA management applications   Network Infrastructure  o Communication lines  Locations and sites: The TSP shall include in this category all facilities where the CA operation is  conducted, where other non-CA related operations are performed, as well as RA offices. Examples of  location assets are:   TSP primary premises   TSP back up sites   RA offices  Personnel: The TSP shall include in this category all different roles involved in the TSP processes and  the access rights to the different assets. Examples of personnel assets are:   TSP trusted roles for CA, VA and TSA   Other operational roles   RA operators   Different administrators at OS, DB, etc. level  Other assets: The TSP should identify all other assets not included in the above categories that have  a value for the organization. Examples of other assets are:   TSP reputation   TSP legal compliance   TSP trust relationships (e.g. to business partners, providers and suppliers or relying parties  like governments, software application vendors)   TSP customer base  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  10  4.4 Identify threats  Following an identification of the assets and value assigned, a threat analysis should be conducted.  Identification of threats is an important step in the risk assessment cycle because a threat is the  potential for a particular threat-source to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability on an asset.  Once threats have been identified, the next step is to estimate the probability of occurrence.  Probability of occurrence of each threat is one of the aspects that influence the overall risk score for  each incident scenario. It shall be determined, in cooperation with other members in the  organization, the probability of occurrence of each threat based on:   Motivation of the threat agent behind each threat   Exploited vulnerabilities by the threat and existing countermeasures   Analysis of past events  For example, a TSP whose facilities are located on seismic activity area should rate the probability of  occurrence of a seismic event higher than one that is located in a non-seismic area.  Threats can be accidental or intentional, human made or natural, internal or external, technical or  physical. To support the threat identification process, we have produced examples of common  threats TSPs may face, which can be found below. The list is informative and should only be used as  a generic reference. The TSP shall have a list of potential threats and their probability of occurrence  which corresponds to its actual business and operational environment.  Natural hazards: The TSP should identify natural hazards that are present in the area where its  locations are set, and based on factors like statistical analysis of previous occurrence, determine  their likelihood. Some examples of natural hazards that can be a threat to the TSP operation are:   Seismic or hydrological events   Fire   Water damage or corrosion   Electromagnetic phenomena   Windstorms  Essential services: The TSP should examine the contracts with providers of essential services, such as  electricity, communication lines, etc. to determine the service level agreements in terms of  downtime. Past history of loss of essential services in the organization should be taken into account.  Some examples of essential service hazards that can be a threat to the TSP operation are:   Disruption of essential services like electricity, communications or air conditioning.   Disruption due to the impact of downtime of in-house services in the data centre  Human made threats: The TSP should determine, based on the type of services it is providing, the  possible human made threats. For example, whether the provider is operating in public networks or  internal networks will have an impact on the probability of materialization of certain human threats.  Some examples of human made hazards that can be a threat to the TSP operation are:   Theft or loss of equipment   Theft or loss of data   Accidental destruction of equipment   Accidental destruction of data   Tampering of equipment   Tampering of data   Malicious software  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  11   Eavesdropping   Cryptanalysis  Threat agents: Intentional threats are caused by threat agents. Human made threats are usually  classified in terms of intentional or accidental, although in some cases natural hazards and loss of  essential services can also be intentionally caused by a threat agent. Additionally to threats, threats  agents are also important to be considered (especially their motivation and their opportunity). Some  examples of threat agents are:   Hackers   Computer criminals   Intelligence organizations   Disgruntled employees   Terrorists  4.5 Analyse vulnerabilities  Identifying possible vulnerabilities is a key step in risk management, as they constitute the possible  weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats.  For example, storage of the private key of the certificate subject in a non-tamper resistant device  can be a potential vulnerability, which would affect a group of assets (subject device, subject private  key) and that could be exploited by a threat (tampering of equipment or data) and lead to a  consequence (compromise of the subject private key). Therefore, in order to determine potential  vulnerabilities, the TSP assets and the existing threats shall be taken into account.  To support the vulnerability identification process, we have produced examples of potential  vulnerabilities of TSPs. The list is informative and should only be used as a generic reference. The TSP  risk analysis shall include a list of potential vulnerabilities which corresponds to its actual business  and operational environment.  Vulnerabilities in the registration process  Subject registration: Vulnerabilities in the registration process may arise from the failure of a proper  verification of the subject identity during the registration or from an inadequate policy (or lack or  enforcement) for proof of identity, which could lead to the success of an impersonation attack.  Registration Authority: Aside from an inadequate subject registration process, the RA can be a  source of vulnerabilities that may lead to fraudulent certificate requests. Inadequate protection  against malicious software could lead to intruders accessing the RA information systems in order to  issue a fraudulent certificate request to the CA, or it could cause accidental malfunction of the  systems, which would interrupt the issuance of certificates. A lack of protection of the RA key could  also cause fraudulent certificate requests. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the communication channel  between the CA and the RA can cause fraudulent requests of certificates, alteration of requests, etc.  by malicious individuals. Examples of vulnerabilities in the registration process are:   RA software inadequate   Lack of appropriate software to protect the RA operation from malicious software   Lack of appropriate protection of the RA private key   Insecure communication channel between the RA and the CA   Lack of technical expertise of the RA operator  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  12  Registration records: RAs shall keep adequate records of the registration documents, as deficiencies  in the archival of registration records by the RA could lead to repudiation by the certificate subject.  Examples of vulnerabilities in the accountability of the registration process are:   Lack of appropriate procedures for registration documents archival   Insufficient protection of registration records  Vulnerabilities in the TSP key management process  The TSP key management process refers to the key generation, backup and recovery, storage, usage,  destruction, etc. processes of the entities involved in the TSP, like the Certification Authority (CA),  the Validation Authority (VA) and the Time Stamping Authority (TSA) as the main actors involved in  these processes.  Key pair generation: The key pair shall be generated in a highly secure way. From a cryptographic  point of view, vulnerabilities in the key generation may exist if the chosen algorithm and key length  (or other parameters) are not strong enough for the needed level of security. Cryptographic  algorithms are under constant study by cryptographers who periodically discover possible attacks  which lead to the algorithms being replaced. Additionally, generation of the key pair in an insecure  physical or logical environment may lead to its loss or theft. Examples of vulnerabilities in the key  pair generation:   The signing key is generated with a weak key generation algorithm or insufficient key length  (or other parameters) for the TSP business requirements   Attack vectors that make the cryptographic algorithms used to generate the key pair  insecure are discovered   Key is generated in a non-secure physical or logical environment   Usage of insecure random number generator   Selection of weak algorithm (or parameters) the keys are generated for   Key generation is not performed by trusted individuals  Key pair storage, backup and recovery: After its generation, the signing keys shall be protected  during their whole life cycle to avoid their loss or theft. Vulnerabilities in the key lifecycle  management come from a lack of physical or logical protection of the private key. Examples of  vulnerabilities in the key pair storage, backup and recovery process:   Private signing key is not kept in a physically or logical secure environment   Private signing key is not backed up   Back-up copies of the private signing key are not stored securely (e.g. access protection,  integrity, …)   Private keys are disposed or archived in non-secure manner   Private key restore can be performed in a non-secure manner  Certificate dissemination: Certificate is disseminated publicly in order for third parties to be able to  validate the signature on subjects’ certificates. Lack of appropriate security measures to guarantee  the integrity and authenticity of the distributed public key may lead to an impersonation by a  malicious individual, who could them generate fake certificates. Examples of vulnerabilities in the  certificate dissemination process:   Certificate is not disseminated in a way that can guarantee its integrity and authenticity   Setting wrong attributes in the certificate, such as policy mapping or path length constraints  Key pair usage:  Signing keys are used to sign subjects’ certificates. In the signing process the private  key is activated and therefore can be subject to attacks. Examples of vulnerabilities in the key usage:  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  13   Lack of security procedures for signing key activation   Security of cryptographic hardware used to sign certificates is not properly verified or  maintained   Signing key pair is used for other purposes than subject certificate signing, except for those  that can be used optionally as CWA 14167-1 indicates.   Insecure processes or applications may lead to sending fake data / certificates to be signed  Vulnerabilities in the subject key management process  Subject key pair generation: Key pairs can be generated in the subject device or by the CA that  afterwards delivers it to the subject. If the key pair is generated by the CA and then delivered to the  subject, either by electronic or physical means, any vulnerability in the delivery process could lead to  a compromise of the subject private key. Another source of vulnerabilities in the subject key  generation may exist if the chosen algorithm and key length (or other parameters) are not strong  enough for the CA needed level of security. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s certificate  generation process:   Subject key is generated with a weak algorithm or insufficient key length (or other  parameters) for the TSP or subject business requirements   Attack vectors that make the cryptographic algorithms used to generate the subject key pair  insecure are discovered   Subject key is generated in a non-secure physical or logical environment   Usage of insecure or weak random number generator   Selection of weak algorithm (or parameters) the keys are generated for   Subject key generation is not performed by trusted individuals   Unsecure delivery of key pair to subject (Only if CA generates key pair)   Failure to properly verify identity of subject when key pair is delivered (Only if CA generates  key pair)   Unsecure retraction of undeliverable keys  Subjects device provisioning: The subject device (or signature creation device, hardware or  software) is where the subject private key is generated and the cryptographic operations with the  certificates are performed. The security features of the subject device are important to guarantee  confidentiality and integrity of the private key and the cryptographic operations. Inappropriate  security characteristics of the subject’s device for the TSP needed assurance level may lead to  liability of the TSP in case of a breach. When the subject device is a cryptographic device, such as a  token or a smart card, it is usually provisioned by the TSP from an external party, usually a  manufacturer. A source of vulnerabilities would be the failure to verify the authenticity of the  subject’s device or its security features. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s device  provisioning process:   Failure to verify the authenticity of the source of the subject’s device   Inappropriate security characteristics of the subject’s device for the TSP needed assurance  level   Tampering with the subject´s device before it reaches the subject, e.g. during transportation   Failure to properly verify identity of subject when device is delivered   Failure in retracting undeliverable subject´s device   Failure in reusing subject´s device, e.g. improper removal of keys of former subject  Subject key pair usage: Subject key pair activation, both in software or hardware format, should be  protected by PIN or password to ensure that it is not conducted fraudulently. The subject shall, as  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  14  well, handle diligently its key pair to avoid misuse. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s private  key usage are:   Lack of protection measures for the subject key pair activation   Negligent handling of private key by subject   Lack of guidelines to train subject on subject key pair custody  Vulnerabilities in the subject certificate management process  Subject certificate generation and delivery to subject: Certificates are generated by the CA  following standardized formats. The CA then signs the certificate and delivers it to the subject, either  physically or electronically. The CA shall ensure that the certificate is delivered to the legitimate  subject. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s certificate generation process:   Unsecure delivery of certificate to subject   Failure to properly verify identity of subject when certificate is delivered   Tampering with the certificate before it reaches the subject, e.g. during transport   Failure in retracting undeliverable certificate, e.g. revocation   Failure to support subject’s platform properly (i.e. Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.),  leads to loss of availability.   Failure to generate certificate with correct contents according to policies.  Subject certificate dissemination: Subjects’ certificates may be disseminated to relying parties after  subject consent. Failure of consent may lead to a breach of personal data protection regulations.  Additionally, if the certificate repository is not disseminated with the appropriate security levels,  certificates could be fraudulently accessed. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s certificate  dissemination:   Subject consent is not obtained before disseminating the certificate   Subject certificate repository is not secured   Certificate repository is not up to date  Vulnerabilities in the revocation management process  Certificate revocation management process: The certificate revocation management process deals  with the complete workflow from the request of a revocation by any party to the inclusion of the  revocation in the certificate revocation status service. Vulnerabilities may arise from a lack of a clear  policy that states who can request revocation and under which circumstances. Additionally, the  absence of a policy on the procedure that should be followed may lead to delays in the revocation  that could facilitate a fraudulent use of the certificate. Other vulnerabilities come from a lack of  mechanisms to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of revocation requests which may lead to  forging requests or repudiation of the request by the originator. Examples of vulnerabilities in the  certificate revocation management process are:   Lack of appropriate revocation policies and procedures   Lack of proper enforcement of policies and procedures   Failure to submit revocation request   Insecure certificate revocation request channels   Lack of proper verification of subject identity during revocation request   Lack of measures to guarantee integrity and authenticity of revocation requests  Certificate revocation status dissemination: TSPs disseminate the revocation status of their issued  certificates periodically. The update frequency of the list of revoked certificates should be reflected  in the TSP policies. Failure to disseminate certificate revocation status in the agreed timeframe could  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  15  lead to revoked certificates being used in a fraudulent way. Lack of appropriate security measures to  guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the distributed certificate revocation list may lead to  forgery by a malicious individual. Examples of vulnerabilities in the certificate revocation status  dissemination process are:   Lack of an appropriate revocation list update policy   Lack of enforcement of the revocation list update policy (including frequency)   Insecure dissemination of the certificate revocation list   Failure to update the status of the certificate   Failure to check revocation status by relying parties   Failure (e.g. downtime, DOS) of revocation dissemination service  Vulnerabilities in the validation process  Certificate validation management process: The certificate validation management process deals  with the complete workflow from the request of a validation of a certificate by any party to the  response with the status of the certificate to the requester. Vulnerabilities may arise from a lack of a  clear policy and technical issues on the procedure that should be followed, that may produce delays  or incorrect answers that could facilitate a fraudulent use of the certificate. Other vulnerabilities  come from a lack of mechanisms to guarantee the non-repudiation of the answers. Examples of  vulnerabilities in the certificate validation management process are:   Lack of appropriate validation procedures   Failure to produce and publish CRLs   Differences between OCSP and CRLs responses   Insecure request and response channels   Lack of a logging system to monitor the system status  Vulnerabilities in the time stamping process  Time stamping management process: The time stamping management process deals with the  complete workflow from the request to provide a time stamp token in order to indicate that a data  set existed at a particular point in time. Vulnerabilities may arise from the use of a no trustworthy  source of time or a lack of procedures and policies. Examples of vulnerabilities in the time stamping  process are:   Lack of use of a trustworthy source of time   Insecure request and response channels   Lack of a logging system to monitor the system status  Vulnerabilities in the TSP information and communication systems  TSP software applications: All TSP applications need to be trustworthy, updated and protected. Lack  of protection of TSP applications from malicious software could be exploited by intruders to access  TSP operation related systems, or it could cause accidental malfunction of the systems. Examples of  vulnerabilities in the TSP software are:   Lack of appropriate measures to protect TSP operation from malicious software   Lack of disaster recovery and business continuity plans   Lack of a logical perimeter security to protect TSP systems   Lack of regular bug fixes and updates   Lack of (automated) status testing   Lack of incident response protocols/policies  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  16   Lack of understanding of software security certification, leading to unpatched software due  to certification (Common Criteria) status.  TSP hardware components: For a TSP, hardware vulnerabilities may arise from the lack of  redundancy of hardware in case of a natural disaster, from accidental hardware malfunction or from  hardware deterioration due to natural hazards. Examples of vulnerabilities in the TSP hardware are:   Lack of appropriate measures to protect equipment from environmental threats   Lack of appropriate measures to protect equipment from theft or tempering   Lack of secure equipment storage facilities   Lack of (automated) status testing   Lack of incident response protocols/policies  TSP communication networks: Communication networks are critical in several aspects of the TSP  operation, such as the communication with the RA or the dissemination of the certificate revocation  status. A lack of proper dimensioning of the communication networks of the TSP could lead to the  inability to issue certificates or to publish revocation status. Examples of vulnerabilities in the TSP  communication networks:   Inadequate dimensioning of the communication networks   Lack of logical protection of communication networks   Lack of (automated) status testing   Lack of incident response protocols/policies  TSP systems audit logs: Lack of audit logging procedures on operations conducted over the TSP  systems supporting all business processes could lead to a loss of accountability of users’ actions in  case of a security incident. Even if an appropriate logging policy exists and it is enforced, lack of  protection of logs against accidental or intentional alteration or destruction can have the same  consequences. Examples of vulnerabilities related to audit logs are:   Lack of appropriate audit logging policies   Insufficient protection of audit logs  Vulnerabilities affecting the TSP operation  TSP policies: TSP shall have clear policies regarding the whole certification management processes.  They shall produce, enforce and make available to subjects, at least, a Certification Policy and a  Certification Practice Statement which states their policies, procedures and operational controls.  Examples of vulnerabilities affecting TSP policies are:   Nonexistence of a Certification Policy or a Certification Practice Statement   Certification Policy or Certification Practice Statement don’t match business objectives   Certification Policy or Certification Practice Statement don’t address properly the level of  risk   Lack of an Information Security Policy   Lack of appropriate contractual agreements with external RAs and third parties   Bad policy enforcement   Insufficient policy updates   Policies not made available to concerned parties   CP or CPS don't match 3rd party requirements (for example CA/B Forum requirements for  web certificates)  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  17  TSP operational procedures: TSP policies shall be enforced through operational procedures followed  on daily operations to avoid security incidents. Examples of vulnerabilities affecting CA operational  procedures are:   Lack of Standard Operational Procedures for TSP operations   Lack of Incident Response Procedures   Lack of Business Continuity and Contingency Plans   Lack of quality assurance plans for issued certificates  TSP personnel: TSP personnel, especially those whose work in the TSP operations (trusted roles),  shall have an appropriate level of training and experience in order to avoid potential errors that  could cause compromise or malfunction of systems. A lack of separation of duties or incorrect audit  procedures can lead to abuse of the system without detection by the organization. Examples of  vulnerabilities affecting CA personnel are:   Lack of appropriate training of personnel operating CA related activities   Lack of separation of duties among trusted roles   Lack of enforcement of the information security policy   Lack of clear job descriptions for CA roles   Lack of employment screening of personnel performing trusted roles   Lack of adequate supervision  TSP facilities: Physical vulnerabilities derive from a lack of appropriate protection of the TSP  facilities, especially those dealing with CA operations. Malicious activities in the perimeter or natural  hazards can lead to a compromise or malfunction of TSP systems or assets. Examples of  vulnerabilities affecting TSP facilities are:   Physically insecure CA key generation environment   Lack of a secure perimeter to protect CA operation areas   Lack of protection measures from natural hazards   Lack of contingency plans against loss of essential services  4.6 Identify existing controls  The list of potential vulnerabilities should be contrasted with the list of existing controls. Existing  controls are the means of mitigating the probability of exploiting potential vulnerabilities as they  decrease the level of exposure. The TSP shall conduct a gap analysis to determine for which  vulnerabilities no sufficient controls are in place.  The gap analysis should be an input to conduct the risk calculation. The probability of an incident  scenario taking place is decreased by controls put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities.  This section presents a set of minimum security measures (it can be used ETSI EN 319 412 [11] family  of standards control specific for TSPs or more generic, the ISO 27000 [2] family of standards  controls) that can be used as a reference for all TSPs issuing electronic certificates, regardless of  their certification scope or qualification status.

Therefore,  consequences don’t need to be necessarily negative. Consequences are identified in order to be able  to determine the risk rating. The impact of each incident scenario will be evaluated based on the  consequences it may have for the TSP.  The following list identifies some of the consequences that different incidents may have on the TSP  operation.  Fraudulent issuance of subjects’ certificates: Incidents involving a breach of trust of the CA or the  RA could lead to an issuance of fraudulent subjects’ certificates, which could be used to impersonate  these subjects. This breach, for example, can be due to a compromise in the CA or RA information  system or gaining access to their private keys. This impersonation could be used to intercept private  communications or forge electronic signatures.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  23  Fraudulent use of valid certificates: Incidents related to the subject’s custody of legitimate issued  certificates or vulnerabilities in the subject device or keys can lead to a malicious individual use in  order to impersonate the data subject. This impersonation could be used to intercept private  communications, to forge electronic signatures or to decipher previously encrypted messages.  Fraudulent use of revoked certificates: Incidents affecting the revocation management system  could lead to the inability to process certificate revocation requests, to disseminate their status, etc.  Inability to issue subjects’ certificates: Incidents affecting availability or integrity of the RA or the CA  information systems can lead the TSP not being able to issue new certificates.  Inability to use valid certificates: Some scenarios like the loss of availability of the certificate  revocation status may lead to inability to check the validity of certificates. Compromises of the CA or  RA can also lead to inability to use valid certificates due to the loss of trust or possibility of  compromise.  Inability to revoke certificates: A failure or compromise of the revocation management systems  could lead to subjects’ willing to revoke certificates not being able to do so, which could facilitate  fraudulent use.  Repudiation by certificate subject: Lack of proper registration policies and record preservation can  lead to a subject claiming repudiation of the actions performed with its certificate. Other integrity  compromises in the certification chain may lead to the same repudiation claim.  Loss of accountability of actions: In case of an incident, existing logs, as well as their protection  again manipulation, are an important tool to be able to determine the nature and source of the  incident. Lack of an appropriate level of logging, loss of existing logs or lack of protection of logs can  lead to the impossibility to determine user actions.  Liability: Any security incident or breach of the certification policies that carries a negative effect on  subjects can lead to legal and financial liability for the TSP.  Loss of reputation: Any security incident, especially those affecting the integrity of the CA  operations and the confidentiality of private keys, could cause a loss of reputation of the TSP that  would negatively affect subject trust.  Loss of qualification status: Lack of compliance with qualification requirements, failure to conduct  the necessary audits or negligence in managing the security of the certificate lifecycle can lead to the  loss of qualification status.  4.8 Identify incident scenarios4  Having the input from identified assets, threats, vulnerabilities and consequences, the next step is to  identify the list of risks, formulated like possible incident scenarios. These incident scenarios are  used in the risk assessment, and combined with likelihood and impact finally determine the risk  scenarios.  Examples of incident scenarios are (some incident scenarios are repeated as they may affect more  than one entity):  Incidents affecting CAs   Compromise of a CA  4  Please also refer to the “Guidelines for trust service providers – Mitigating the impact of security incidents”  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  24   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Compromise of the revocation systems   Repudiation claim by certificate subject   Accidental loss of availability of the certification services   Personal data breach  Incidents affecting RAs   Compromise of a RA   Impersonation   Repudiation claim by certificate subject   Personal data breach  Incidents affecting the subject certificate   Compromise of the subject’s key pair   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Repudiation claim by certificate subject   Personal data breach  Incidents affecting VAs   Compromise of the VA   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Accidental loss of availability of the validation services  Incidents affecting TSAs   Compromise of the TSA   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Accidental loss of availability of the time stamping services  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  25  5 Analyse risk  Once all the parameters that influence the risk calculation have been identified (assets, threats,  vulnerabilities, existing controls, consequences, and incident scenarios) the TSP has enough  information to start the risk analysis process. Risk analysis (the term risk analysis is sometimes  interchanged with risk assessment) is defined as a systematic use of information to identify sources  and to estimate the risk, where source is defined as an item or activity having a potential for a  consequence (ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4]).  Risk assessment also takes into account special circumstances under which assets may require  additional protection, such as with regulatory compliance.  During the risk analysis phase the TSP will use all the identified sources (assets, vulnerabilities,  threats) to estimate the risk, in terms of impact and probability.  5.1 Assess impact  Impact is defined as the result of an unwanted incident (ISO/IEC PDTR 13335-1). Impact can be  measured by the consequences the incident has on the organization assets, for example:   Loss of availability   Loss of integrity   Loss of confidentiality   Loss of accountability   Non legal compliance   Financial loss   Loss of reputation  During the next step of the risk assessment process, the TSP needs to determine the possible  consequences of each identified incident scenario and the impact it would have on the TSP assets.  For this purpose, a mapping between the identified incident scenarios and the consequences should  be undertaken, in order to link each incident scenario with its possible consequences. Based on the  potential consequences, for each incident scenario the level of impact can be determined.  In June and July 2013 ENISA conducted a questionnaire-based survey among trust services providers,  in which 46 participants took part. It had for goal to identify security practices in force at these  organisations5.  The survey asked to rate the potential impact for the trust service providers of identified incident  scenarios. Results are depicted in Figure 2. The values represent the average impact score (from 0 –  “no impact” to 10 – “maximal impact”) assigned by the respondents.  5  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013. The participants are mentioned in the acknowledgements at the beginning of  this document.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  26  Figure 2: Estimated impact (based on survey results)  5.2 Assess probablility  Probability is defined as the extent to which an event is likely to occur (ENISA). To determine the  probability of occurrence, each incident scenario should be mapped against:   The possible threats that could cause the incident and their probability of occurrence   The vulnerabilities that could be exploited for the incident to take occur   The existing controls in place that mitigate and reduce the exposure to the vulnerabilities  Taking into account all these parameters, each incident scenario should be assigned a probability  score. ENISA survey on security practices of trust services providers asked to rate the identified  incident scenarios in terms of probability of occurrence for any certification service provider (0 – “no  risk”, 10 – “maximal probability”). Probability values in the Figure 3 represent the median impact  score assigned by the trust service providers participating in the survey  8,7  7,6  6,7 6,6  5,7 5,4  4,7 4,5 4,3  0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,0 5,0 6,0 7,0 8,0 9,0  10,0  Es ti  m at  e d  im p  ac t  Level of impact estimation  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  27  Figure 3: Estimated probability (based on survey results)  This figure shows that the probability of a compromise of a CA is quite small taking into account that  this scenario is one of the worst that can happen to a TSP and according to the survey is indicated by  the TSPs that one scenario which is likely to occur is the repudiation claim done by the certificate  subject, mainly, claiming didn´t request for a certificate.  The answers of respondents (depicted by colours) show that the probability of these scenarios is  judged being unlikely to occur.  5.3 Estimate level of risk  Risk estimation is defined as the process used to assign values to the probability and consequences  of a risk (ENISA). The level of risk is determined as a combination of the expected impact of the  incident and the likelihood of occurrence. Different weighting scores can be assigned to the assigned  impact / likelihood pair of each incident scenario.  Based on the identified impact and probability scores on ENISA survey responses, the identified risks  would have the level of risk depicted on the Figure 4 (values as on Figures 2 and 3).  4,0  3,8  3,5 3,4  3,1 2,9  2,7  2,4  0,9  0,0  0,5  1,0  1,5  2,0  2,5  3,0  3,5  4,0  4,5  ES ti  m at  e d  p ro  b ab  ili ty  Risk probability estimation  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  28  Figure 4 Risk level estimation (based on survey results)  This figure shows the level of impact caused by these possible scenarios and indicates that the  compromise of a CA has the highest level of impact in the TSP business followed by a compromise of  the cryptographic algorithms.  On the other hand, the compromise of a subject key pair and the claiming to repudiate the  certificate subject has a low level of impact in the TSP business.  This level of risk shall be reduced by applying the correspondent countermeasures.  0,0  2,0  4,0  6,0  0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,0 5,0 6,0 7,0 8,0 9,0 10,0  P ro  b ab  ili ty  Level of impact  Risk estimation  Compromise of the Certificate Authority Compromise of the Cryptographic Algorithms Compromise of a Registration Authority Compromise of the Revocation Services Personal Data Breach Impersonation  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  29  6 Evaluate risk  Risk evaluation is the process of comparing the estimated risk against given risk criteria to determine  the significance of risk (ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4]).  Risk criteria can include associated cost and benefits, legal and statutory requirements, socio- economic aspects, the concerns of stakeholders, priorities and other inputs to the assessment  (ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4]). Risk criteria are closely linked to the TSP business environment and should be  determined by the TSP.  To support the risk evaluation process, we have produced examples of evaluations, based solely on  the risk estimation, of the main risks TSPs face, which can be found below. The list is informative and  should only be used as a reference. The TSP shall produce their own risk universe which corresponds  to its actual business and operational environment, including the risk criteria of its own organization  in the final evaluation.  For each identified risk, a description and a characterization has been made, in order to provide a  better understanding of the factors the that can have any effect on the potential materialization of  the risk. The following factors have been taken into account:   Description: Brief description of the characteristics of the identified risk and its likelihood  and impact score.   Related assets: Examples of the assets that could be affected by the incident scenarios  involved in the risk.   Possible vulnerabilities: Examples of vulnerabilities that, if being exploited, could lead for a  materialization of the risk.   Potential threats: Examples of threats that could cause the materialization of the risk.   Possible consequences: Examples of consequences that the materialization of the risk could  have.

Security management ensures that the risks are identified and an adequate control environment is  established to mitigate these risks. There is a need to manage the risks by defining and controlling  threats and vulnerabilities. To achieve this, it is important to understand the principles behind the  management of risk and the concepts underlying the risk management process.  The choice of the appropriate methodology to perform the risk assessment should be made by the  organisation itself. This study has provided a general overview of how a risk assessment can be  conducted and how to identify risks specific to trust service providers. It can serve as a guide to  assist providers when conducting an assessment.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  40  Annex 1 – Definitions  Asset: any person, facility, material, information or activity that has value to the organization, its  business operations and their continuity, including Information resources that support the  organization's mission.  Authentication: process that allows the validation of the electronic identification of a natural or  legal person; or of the origin and integrity of an electronic data;  Certificate: Electronic attestation which links electronic signature or seal validation data of a natural  or a legal person respectively to the certificate and confirms those data of that person;  Certification Authority: An entity trusted to issue certificates. A certification service provider may  have one or several Certificate Authorities. It is generally a trusted party or trusted third party that  accepts the responsibility of managing the certificate process by issuing, distributing and verifying  certificates.  Certification Service Provider: An entity or a legal or natural person who issues certificates or  provides other services related to electronic signatures.  Contingency Plan: A plan for emergency response, backup operations, and post-disaster recovery in  a system, as part of a security program, to ensure availability of critical system resources and  facilitate continuity of operations in a crisis.  Cryptographic module: An umbrella term covering:   cryptographic algorithms (e.g. encryption, hashing, key generation, ...)   cryptographic parameters (e.g. key length, elliptic curve, ...)   cryptographic protocols (e.g. key exchange, ...)   cryptographic implementations (e.g. software libraries, HSMs, …)  Data Availability: The fact that data is accessible and services are operational. It can be described as  the property of being accessible and useable upon demand by an authorized entity. In the context of  service level agreements, availability generally refers to the degree to which a system may suffer  degradation or interruption in its service to the customer as a consequence of failures of one or  more of its parts.  Data Confidentiality: The protection of communications or stored data against interception and  reading by unauthorized persons. Confidentiality means keeping the content of information secret  from all entities except those that are authorized to access it.  Data Integrity: The confirmation that data which has been sent, received, or stored are complete  and unchanged, which implies that the items of interest (facts, data, attributes etc.) have not been  subject to manipulation by unauthorized entities.  Electronic seal: Data in electronic form which are attached to or logically associated with other  electronic data to ensure the origin and the integrity of the associated data; (Proposal eSignatures)  Electronic Signature: Data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated to other  electronic data and serves as a method of authentication.  From a legal perspective, an electronic signature is not necessarily considered equivalent to a  handwritten signature. When it meets a number of conditions, it can be put on par with a  handwritten one.  Event: Occurrence of a particular set of circumstances  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  41  Evidence: Information that either by itself or when used in conjunction with other information is  used to establish proof about an event or action. Evidence does not necessarily prove truth or  existence of something but contributes to establish proof.  Hash Function: A mathematical function which maps values from a large (possibly very large)  domain into a smaller range. A \"good\" hash function is such that the results of applying the function  to a set of values in the domain will be evenly distributed and apparently at random over the range.  Impact: The result of an incident.  Incident: An event that has been assessed as having an actual or potentially adverse effect on the  security or performance of a system.  Mitigation: Limitation of any negative consequence of a particular event  Probability: Extent to which an event is likely to occur.  Private Key: In a public key cryptosystem, that key of a user's key pair which is known only by that  user  Public Key: In a public key cryptosystem, that key of a user's key pair which is publicly known.  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): The infrastructure able to support the management of public keys  able to support authentication, encryption, integrity or non-repudiation services.  Relying Party: A user or agent that relies on the data in a certificate in making decisions.  Risk: The potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and  thereby cause harm to the organization.  Risk Analysis: A process that examines an organization´s information resources, its existing controls,  and its remaining organization and computer system vulnerabilities.  Risk Assessment: A process used to identify and evaluate risk and their potential effects  Risk Management:  The discipline of identifying and measuring security risks associated with an  information system, and controlling and reducing those risks to an acceptable level. The goal of risk  management is to invest organizational resources to mitigate security risks in a cost-effective  manner, while enabling timely and effective mission accomplishment.  Signature Creation Data: Unique data, such as codes or private cryptographic keys, which are used  by the signatory to create an electronic signature  Signature Creation Device: Configured software or hardware used to create an electronic signature  Subject: Entity identified in a certificate as the holder of the private key associated with the public  key given in the certificate.  Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an asset through  unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of service.  Trust Service: Any electronic service consisting in the creation, verification, validation, handling and  preservation of electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic documents,  electronic delivery services, website authentication, and electronic certificates, including certificates  for electronic signature and for electronic seals  Vulnerability: The existence of a weakness, design, or implementation error that can lead to an  unexpected, undesirable event compromising the security of the computer system, network,  application, or protocol involved.

and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.

Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  iv  Executive summary  E-Government services have significant potential to make public services more efficient for the  benefit of citizens and businesses in terms of time and money. And while these benefits are  increasingly being felt nationally, e-Government services still face administrative and legal barriers  on a cross-border level, although pan-European projects like STORK have shown that technical issues  of interoperability of electronic identifications can be overcome. In order to remove existing barriers  for cross-border e-ID based services the European Commission has proposed in June 2012 a draft  regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal  market [38], which will replace the existing Electronic Signature Directive 1999/93/EC [37]. The main  goals of this action are to:   ensure mutual recognition and acceptance of electronic identification across borders   give legal effect and mutual recognition to trust services   enhance current rules on e-signatures   provide a legal framework for electronic seals, time stamping, electronic document  acceptability, electronic delivery and website authentication.   ensure minimal security level of trust services providers systems   enforce obligation of notifications about security incidents at trust services providers  In Article 15 of the above mentioned draft regulation the EC proposes that trust services providers  have to demonstrate due diligence, in relation to the identification of risks and adoption of  appropriate security practices, and notify competent bodies of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided and on the personal data  maintained therein.  In this context, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) developed  in 2013 the Guidelines for trust services providers, discussing the minimal security levels to be  maintained by the trust services providers. The study is split into three parts:  Security framework: describing the framework surrounding trust service providers (TPSs), focusing  on EU standards, but taking into account others where relevant.  Risk assessment: discussing the principles and concepts of managing the risks applicaple to TSPs by  defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities.  Mitigating the impact of security incidents: recommending measures to mitigate the impact of  security incidents on trust service providers (TSP) by proposing suitable technical and organisational  means to handle the security risks posed to the TSP.  All three parts can also be used separately, as they address different issues and target different  audience, so the introductory sections overlap.  This document, Part 2: Risk Assessement, covers the following aspects:   Assets: identification, classification and evaluation   Threats to assets: classification and evaluation   Vulnerabilities present in the environment   Probability or frequency of the threat   The impact that the exposure can have on the organization   Countermeasures that can reduce the impact   The residual risk, risk acceptance, risk treatment plan, etc.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  v  Table of Contents  Executive summary iv  1 The concept of Trust Service Providers 1  2 Introduction to risk assessment 3  3 Risk assessments on TSPs 4  4 TSP infrastructure 5  4.1 The involved entities 5  4.2 The involved processes 6  4.3 Determine assets 7  4.4 Identify threats 10  4.5 Analyse vulnerabilities 11  4.6 Identify existing controls 17  4.7 Determine consequences 22  4.8 Identify incident scenarios 23  5 Analyse risk 25  5.1 Assess impact 25  5.2 Assess probablility 26  5.3 Estimate level of risk 27  6 Evaluate risk 29  Risk 1: Compromise of a Certification Authority 29  Risk 2: Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms 30  Risk 3: Compromise of a Registration Authority 31  Risk 4: Compromise of the revocation services 32  Risk 5: Personal data breach 33  Risk 6: Impersonation 33  Risk 7: Loss of availability of the certification services 34  Risk 8: Repudiation claim by certificate subject 35  Risk 9: Compromise of a subject’s key pair 36  Risk 10: Compromise of a Validation Authority 36  Risk 11: Compromise of a Time Stamping Authority 37  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  vi  7 Conclusions 39  Annex 1 – Definitions 40  Annex 2 – Abbreviations 42  Annex 3 – Bibliography 44  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  1  1 The concept of Trust Service Providers  A trust service provider (TSP) is a supplier facilitating electronic security services to customers. The  scope of such services includes, but is not limited to, electronic signatures and seals, electronic time  stamps, and electronic authentication. Usually, these services rely on electronic certificates issued by  certificate service providers (CSP) which is a type of TSP. For the sake of simplicity, we use the CSP as  a running example for a TSP within the document at hand. All recommendations apply analogously  to other types of TSP as well.  An electronic certificate (or certificate for short) is an electronic document that binds certain pieces  of data together and is signed by a trusted third party that vows for the binding. For example, an  attribute certificate binds an identity, such as a person, a service, or a device, to certain attributes,  such as profession or access rights. Another example is a public key certificate that binds an identity  to a public key. This certificate can then be used, amongst others, to verify the identity or signature  of the certificate holder. In order to keep things understandable, we use public key certificates as  running example throughout this document. All recommendations apply analogously to other types  of certificates as well.  Electronic certificates rely on public key cryptography. In public key cryptography, two separate  keys, mathematically linked, are provided to an entity. One of the keys is public and can be  disseminated, while the other key is private and needs to be under the sole custody of the key pair  owner. The private key cannot be derived by sole knowledge of the public key, but one key  completes the other in terms of cryptographic operations. For example, a cipher text created using  the public key can be decrypted using the private key; equally, the public key can be used to verify  signatures that were created by the private key. Because of this property of public key cryptography,  and by ensuring the secrecy of the private key and the authenticity of the public key, a relying party  can verify that an entity presenting a certificate is who it claims to be or that a signature is valid.  However, a third party is needed to ensure that the information contained in the certificate,  including the public key, is actually linked to the real identity of the entity. This is done by a TSP,  which uses its so-called certificate authority (CA) signing keys to sign the entities’ certificates. With  this operation the TSP attests that the certificate was issued to the entity whose information is  contained in it. Hence, we distinguish between two different types of certificates:   Subject certificates, also called end entity certificates, that are used for day to day tasks such  as authentication, signatures, or encryption. The holder of such a certificate is called the  subject.   CA signing certificates that are used to sign other certificates. Apart from signing subject  certificates, CA certificates are often also used to sign other CA certificates to establish a  trust relationship between CAs.  Electronic certificates can be used for a variety of purposes, some of the most common being to  support electronic signatures, electronic seals or website authentication. Electronic signatures or  seals are meant for natural persons (signatures) or legal entities (seals) to be able to produce digital  signatures on documents or messages in order to ensure:   The integrity of the document or message: attest that the document or message has not  been altered.   The authenticity and non-repudiation: attest that the document or message was produced  by the certificate owner.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  2  In the context of authentication, when an entity A presents itself to another entity B with its  electronic certificate, entity B can verify that the entity A is actually who it claims to be by checking  that entity A is in possession of the private key associated with the public key included in the  certificate.  In the case of encryption, electronic certificates can also be used to provide confidentiality. The use  of public key cryptography for the exchange of  session keys ensures the confidentiality of the  communication. Here, the session key is the entity that carries out the encryption of the messages.  The service of Certificate Service Providers can be broken down into the following component  services   Registration service: verifies the identity and, if applicable, any specific attributes of a  subject. The results of this service are passed to the certificate generation service.   Certificate generation service: creates and signs certificates based on the identity and other  attributes verified by the registration service.   Dissemination service: disseminates certificates to subjects, and if the subject consents,  makes them available to relying parties. This service also makes available the CA's terms and  conditions, and any published policy and practice information, to subscribers and relying  parties.   Revocation management service: processes requests and reports relating to revocation to  determine the necessary action to be taken. The results of this service are distributed  through the revocation status service.   Revocation status service: provides certificate revocation status information to relying  parties. This may be based upon certificate revocation lists or a real time service which  provides status information on an individual basis. The status information may be updated  on a regular basis and hence may not reflect the current status of the certificate.  and optionally:   Subject device provision service: prepares and provides a signature-creation device to  subjects.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  3  2 Introduction to risk assessment  As the networked world continues to shape and impact every aspect of our lives, threats to the  global industry continue in parallel.  Security management ensures that the risks are identified and an adequate control environment is  established to mitigate these risks.  There is a need to manage the risks by defining and controlling threats and vulnerabilities. To  achieve this, it is important to understand the principles behind the management of risk and the  concepts underlying the risk management process. These principles and concepts will be discussed  in this document. Interactions between them are depicted on Figure 1.  Figure 1 Concept of security risk management  Risk Assessment (also known as risk analysis) will evaluate:   Assets: identification, classification and evaluation   Threats to assets: classification and evaluation   Vulnerabilities present in the environment   Probability or frequency of the threat   The impact that the exposure can have on the organization   Countermeasures that can reduce the impact   The residual risk, risk acceptance, risk treatment plan, etc.  Unlike risk assessments, vulnerability assessments tend to focus on technology aspects of an  organization, such as networking or software applications. Through the use of different tools and  methodologies, these assesments can provide information on the type and severity of vulnerability.  It´s also important to identify the risk avoidance, the risk transfer which is the ability to transfer the  risk to another entity like an insurance company, the risk mitigation and the acceptance of the risk  that can be based on a business decision.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  4  3 Risk assessments on TSPs  In order to conduct a risk assessment, several methodologies exist. The goal of this report is not to  describe in detail the different existing methods, but to provide a general overview of how a risk  assessment is conducted and to identify risks specific to trust service providers that serve as a guide  to assist providers when conducting an assessment.  For the purpose of the document, the risk assessment phases defined in ISO/IEC 27005:2008  (Information technology - Security techniques - Information security risk management) [2] are  followed:   Risk identification: Identifying the different factors (assets, threats, vulnerabilities,  consequences and incident scenarios) that will identify and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  5  4 TSP infrastructure  The first step in the risk assessment process is to determine the scope included in the risk  assessment and its boundaries. The TSP shall define the entities involved in the trust services it  provides and the role of each entity.  To support the system scope delimitation process, a list of examples of common entities and  processes involved in the operations of a TSP have been produced, which can be found below. This  list is informative and should only be used as a generic reference.  4.1 The involved entities2  Certificate Authority: Certificate Authorities are entities that issue electronic certificates. TSPs  issuing electronic certificates have one or several CAs. Certificate Authorities handle the whole  certification lifecycle management process, with the exception of the registration process which is  done by the Registration Authority. Commonly, Certificate Authorities generate and maintain their  own key pair which they use to sign the certificates they issue. CAs act as a trust anchor: when a  subject presents him/her certificate to a third party, it is the signature by a trusted CA in the subject  certificate what ensures relying parties that the certificate is legitimated.  Registration Authority: The Registration Authority is the entity that verifies the certificate  requester’s identity to ensure the certificate is issued to the legitimate subject. Once the identity is  verified, the RA sends a certificate request to the CA, who will then produce an electronic certificate  and deliver it back to subject. The Registration Authority can be part of the TSP or it may be an  external entity with some type of contract or agreement with the TSP. For example, a small TSP  requiring physical presence of the subject may delegate this activity to an external CA as deploying a  whole set of physical offices may not be feasible.  Subject: The subject is the entity who owns an electronic certificate issued by the TSP. A subject can  be natural persons or legal entities. Subjects request certificates from TSPs which they use for many  different purposes, such as electronic signatures, authentication or encryption. Subjects are bound  to a certificate by the signature of the CA, who vows for their identity.  Relying party: The relying party is an entity that relies on the certificates issued by the CA to verify  the subject identity or signature validity. Relying parties can be signature validation platforms, online  services that use the digital certificates for authenticating users, browsers that validate web  authentication certificates, end users, etc.  Validation Authority: The Validation Authority (VA) is an entity that provides information on the  status of certificates to verify whether certificates are valid or not. There can be one or more VAs  connected to each CA in the PKI. The VA shall be capable of storing information on the status of the  certificates generated by one or more Certification Authorities (CAs).  The VA shall guarantee the non-repudiation of its responses. These responses are digitally-signed by  the Validation Authority and specify the date and status (valid, revoked, cancelled or unknown) of a  certificate and these results can be published e.g. via CRLs or OCSP.  Time-stamping Authority: The Time-stamping Authority (TSA) is the entity that provides a proof of  existence for a particular data set at a particular time. This is usually used to verify that a digital  signature was applied to a message for example, before the corresponding certificate was revoked  2  Further definitions can be found in ISO/IEC 13335 [1], ISO/IEC 24760 [3], ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4], RFC 3647 [23],  ETSI TS 102158 [14], ETSI TS 102042 [16], Directive 1999/93/EC [37]  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  6  thus allowing a revoked public key certificate to be used for verifying signatures created prior to the  time of revocation.  The TSA shall generate a digitally-signed time-stamp that includes the time of the request; the  information that securely binds the stamp to the electronic document; and a unique registration  number for auditing purposes.  4.2 The involved processes3  This is a list of the main processes involved in the most commonly used TSP operations. The list is  informative and should only be used as a generic reference.  The registration process: The registration process is the initial process by which the subject goes to  the registration authority to request a certificate. The subject presents a proof of identity and the RA  sends a certificate request to the CA which upon production of the certificate delivers it back to the  subject.  The key management process: The key management process comprises all the processes which are  in place to manage the key pairs of the CAs, VAs and TSAs mainly during its complete lifecycle:   The key pair generation   The key pair storage, backup and recovery   The certificate dissemination   The key pair usage   The key pair destruction   The key renewal, rekey and update   Key archive  The subject key management process: The subject key management process comprises all the  processes that are in place to manage the keys of the subject during their lifetime:   The subject key generation   The subject key device provisioning   The subject key storage, backup and recovery   The subject key renewal, rekey and update   The subject key dissemination   The subject key destruction  The subject certificate management process: The subject certificate management process  comprises all the processes that are in place to manage the subject certificate:   The subject certificate generation   The subject certificate delivery   The subject certificate renewal, rekey and update   The subject certificate dissemination  The revocation process: The revocation process comprises all actions from the revocation request to  the revocation publication in the certificate revocation status service.  3  Please also refer to the “Guidelines for trust service providers – Mitigating the impact of security incidents”  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  7  The validation process: The validation process comprises all actions from users or trust service  providers on requesting / providing the status of the digital certificates. This can be done e.g.  through:   CRL (Certificate Revocation List)   OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)  The time stamping process: The time stamping process comprises all action from users and trust  service providers that want to add time stamps to electronic documents or transactions.  The information and condition process: These processes comprise all actions to protect external  and internally the TSP infrastructure.  The operational process: These operational processes comprise all actions related to procedures  and policies established by the TSP to perform its activities.  4.3 Determine assets  In a risk assessment context, assets are what the organization needs to protect. Assets are not only  physical, tangible items that the organization can easily classify in terms of monetary value. The  information that the organization produces or gathers is an important asset as well as the trust  relationships and reputation as examples of intangible assets.  All assets shall be identified and listed. Each asset shall be assigned an owner to determine who  finally has the responsibility for the protection and maintenance of that asset.  The assets shall be categorized based on their type and characteristics.  Once assets have been identified, the next step is to determine their value, together with the asset  owner. An asset’s value can be determined based on the negative consequences an incident  affecting them may have for the organization. This can be qualitative (recommended) and  quantitative (money).  In the case of TSPs, an example of a critical asset would be the CA private key. An incident involving  the confidentiality or integrity of the CA private key could have very damaging consequences for the  TSP. For example, a malicious individual could impersonate the CA and generate fraudulent  certificates. Therefore, the value of the CA private key would certainly be estimated by any TSP as  very high. Following this approach, the TSP shall conduct an evaluation of the value of all the  identified assets.  To support the asset identification process, some examples of common assets TSPs own, are listed  below. The list is informative and should only be used as a generic reference. The TSP shall have a list  of assets and their value which corresponds to its actual business and operational environment. The  list has been organized following the guidelines provided in the ISO 27005 [2], which divides assets in  two categories:   Primary assets, which comprise the information assets and the business processes.   Supporting assets, which comprise software, hardware, network, personnel and locations.  Primary assets  Information assets: Information assets include all data that are handled by the TSP, either produced  by it or handled by third parties. In this category the TSP should include at least all the information  related to the certificates (public and private keys, certificate content, etc.) as well as all the logs of  the system (CA operation logs, OCSP logs, etc.). Examples of information assets in a TSP are:  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  8   CA certificate   CA private key   RA certificate   RA private key   VA certificate   VA private key   TSA certificate   TSA private key   Subjects’ certificates   Subjects’ private keys   Registration archives   Audit logs of the different involved entities   Certificate revocation status request logs   Certificate revocation lists  Business processes: The TSP should identify all the business processes that are conducted in the  organization. The list should include all certificate lifecycle management processes, plus any  additional processes the TSP may have depending on the additional services (validation,  preservation, etc.) that the organization is offering.

Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  9  Supporting assets  Software, hardware and networks: The TSP shall include in the asset inventory all software  applications; all hardware infrastructures (servers, user equipment, cryptographic modules, etc.) and  all network infrastructures that are used in the TSP. Examples of software, hardware and networks  assets are:   Hardware  o CA equipment: servers for CA root and subordinates CAs  o Other CA necessary equipment, e.g. LDAP  o RA equipment: PCs, printers, etc.  o VA equipment  o TSA equipment  o Subject devices: smartcards, USB tokens, etc.  o Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)  o Web servers   Software  o CA key management applications  o CA backup applications  o Other CA applications  o RA applications  o VA management applications  o TSA management applications   Network Infrastructure  o Communication lines  Locations and sites: The TSP shall include in this category all facilities where the CA operation is  conducted, where other non-CA related operations are performed, as well as RA offices. Examples of  location assets are:   TSP primary premises   TSP back up sites   RA offices  Personnel: The TSP shall include in this category all different roles involved in the TSP processes and  the access rights to the different assets. Examples of personnel assets are:   TSP trusted roles for CA, VA and TSA   Other operational roles   RA operators   Different administrators at OS, DB, etc. level  Other assets: The TSP should identify all other assets not included in the above categories that have  a value for the organization. Examples of other assets are:   TSP reputation   TSP legal compliance   TSP trust relationships (e.g. to business partners, providers and suppliers or relying parties  like governments, software application vendors)   TSP customer base  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  10  4.4 Identify threats  Following an identification of the assets and value assigned, a threat analysis should be conducted.  Identification of threats is an important step in the risk assessment cycle because a threat is the  potential for a particular threat-source to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability on an asset.  Once threats have been identified, the next step is to estimate the probability of occurrence.  Probability of occurrence of each threat is one of the aspects that influence the overall risk score for  each incident scenario. It shall be determined, in cooperation with other members in the  organization, the probability of occurrence of each threat based on:   Motivation of the threat agent behind each threat   Exploited vulnerabilities by the threat and existing countermeasures   Analysis of past events  For example, a TSP whose facilities are located on seismic activity area should rate the probability of  occurrence of a seismic event higher than one that is located in a non-seismic area.  Threats can be accidental or intentional, human made or natural, internal or external, technical or  physical. To support the threat identification process, we have produced examples of common  threats TSPs may face, which can be found below. The list is informative and should only be used as  a generic reference. The TSP shall have a list of potential threats and their probability of occurrence  which corresponds to its actual business and operational environment.  Natural hazards: The TSP should identify natural hazards that are present in the area where its  locations are set, and based on factors like statistical analysis of previous occurrence, determine  their likelihood. Some examples of natural hazards that can be a threat to the TSP operation are:   Seismic or hydrological events   Fire   Water damage or corrosion   Electromagnetic phenomena   Windstorms  Essential services: The TSP should examine the contracts with providers of essential services, such as  electricity, communication lines, etc. to determine the service level agreements in terms of  downtime. Past history of loss of essential services in the organization should be taken into account.  Some examples of essential service hazards that can be a threat to the TSP operation are:   Disruption of essential services like electricity, communications or air conditioning.   Disruption due to the impact of downtime of in-house services in the data centre  Human made threats: The TSP should determine, based on the type of services it is providing, the  possible human made threats. For example, whether the provider is operating in public networks or  internal networks will have an impact on the probability of materialization of certain human threats.  Some examples of human made hazards that can be a threat to the TSP operation are:   Theft or loss of equipment   Theft or loss of data   Accidental destruction of equipment   Accidental destruction of data   Tampering of equipment   Tampering of data   Malicious software  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  11   Eavesdropping   Cryptanalysis  Threat agents: Intentional threats are caused by threat agents. Human made threats are usually  classified in terms of intentional or accidental, although in some cases natural hazards and loss of  essential services can also be intentionally caused by a threat agent. Additionally to threats, threats  agents are also important to be considered (especially their motivation and their opportunity). Some  examples of threat agents are:   Hackers   Computer criminals   Intelligence organizations   Disgruntled employees   Terrorists  4.5 Analyse vulnerabilities  Identifying possible vulnerabilities is a key step in risk management, as they constitute the possible  weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats.  For example, storage of the private key of the certificate subject in a non-tamper resistant device  can be a potential vulnerability, which would affect a group of assets (subject device, subject private  key) and that could be exploited by a threat (tampering of equipment or data) and lead to a  consequence (compromise of the subject private key). Therefore, in order to determine potential  vulnerabilities, the TSP assets and the existing threats shall be taken into account.  To support the vulnerability identification process, we have produced examples of potential  vulnerabilities of TSPs. The list is informative and should only be used as a generic reference. The TSP  risk analysis shall include a list of potential vulnerabilities which corresponds to its actual business  and operational environment.  Vulnerabilities in the registration process  Subject registration: Vulnerabilities in the registration process may arise from the failure of a proper  verification of the subject identity during the registration or from an inadequate policy (or lack or  enforcement) for proof of identity, which could lead to the success of an impersonation attack.  Registration Authority: Aside from an inadequate subject registration process, the RA can be a  source of vulnerabilities that may lead to fraudulent certificate requests. Inadequate protection  against malicious software could lead to intruders accessing the RA information systems in order to  issue a fraudulent certificate request to the CA, or it could cause accidental malfunction of the  systems, which would interrupt the issuance of certificates. A lack of protection of the RA key could  also cause fraudulent certificate requests. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the communication channel  between the CA and the RA can cause fraudulent requests of certificates, alteration of requests, etc.  by malicious individuals. Examples of vulnerabilities in the registration process are:   RA software inadequate   Lack of appropriate software to protect the RA operation from malicious software   Lack of appropriate protection of the RA private key   Insecure communication channel between the RA and the CA   Lack of technical expertise of the RA operator  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  12  Registration records: RAs shall keep adequate records of the registration documents, as deficiencies  in the archival of registration records by the RA could lead to repudiation by the certificate subject.  Examples of vulnerabilities in the accountability of the registration process are:   Lack of appropriate procedures for registration documents archival   Insufficient protection of registration records  Vulnerabilities in the TSP key management process  The TSP key management process refers to the key generation, backup and recovery, storage, usage,  destruction, etc. processes of the entities involved in the TSP, like the Certification Authority (CA),  the Validation Authority (VA) and the Time Stamping Authority (TSA) as the main actors involved in  these processes.  Key pair generation: The key pair shall be generated in a highly secure way. From a cryptographic  point of view, vulnerabilities in the key generation may exist if the chosen algorithm and key length  (or other parameters) are not strong enough for the needed level of security. Cryptographic  algorithms are under constant study by cryptographers who periodically discover possible attacks  which lead to the algorithms being replaced. Additionally, generation of the key pair in an insecure  physical or logical environment may lead to its loss or theft. Examples of vulnerabilities in the key  pair generation:   The signing key is generated with a weak key generation algorithm or insufficient key length  (or other parameters) for the TSP business requirements   Attack vectors that make the cryptographic algorithms used to generate the key pair  insecure are discovered   Key is generated in a non-secure physical or logical environment   Usage of insecure random number generator   Selection of weak algorithm (or parameters) the keys are generated for   Key generation is not performed by trusted individuals  Key pair storage, backup and recovery: After its generation, the signing keys shall be protected  during their whole life cycle to avoid their loss or theft. Vulnerabilities in the key lifecycle  management come from a lack of physical or logical protection of the private key. Examples of  vulnerabilities in the key pair storage, backup and recovery process:   Private signing key is not kept in a physically or logical secure environment   Private signing key is not backed up   Back-up copies of the private signing key are not stored securely (e.g. access protection,  integrity, …)   Private keys are disposed or archived in non-secure manner   Private key restore can be performed in a non-secure manner  Certificate dissemination: Certificate is disseminated publicly in order for third parties to be able to  validate the signature on subjects’ certificates. Lack of appropriate security measures to guarantee  the integrity and authenticity of the distributed public key may lead to an impersonation by a  malicious individual, who could them generate fake certificates. Examples of vulnerabilities in the  certificate dissemination process:   Certificate is not disseminated in a way that can guarantee its integrity and authenticity   Setting wrong attributes in the certificate, such as policy mapping or path length constraints  Key pair usage:  Signing keys are used to sign subjects’ certificates. In the signing process the private  key is activated and therefore can be subject to attacks. Examples of vulnerabilities in the key usage:  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  13   Lack of security procedures for signing key activation   Security of cryptographic hardware used to sign certificates is not properly verified or  maintained   Signing key pair is used for other purposes than subject certificate signing, except for those  that can be used optionally as CWA 14167-1 indicates.   Insecure processes or applications may lead to sending fake data / certificates to be signed  Vulnerabilities in the subject key management process  Subject key pair generation: Key pairs can be generated in the subject device or by the CA that  afterwards delivers it to the subject. If the key pair is generated by the CA and then delivered to the  subject, either by electronic or physical means, any vulnerability in the delivery process could lead to  a compromise of the subject private key. Another source of vulnerabilities in the subject key  generation may exist if the chosen algorithm and key length (or other parameters) are not strong  enough for the CA needed level of security. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s certificate  generation process:   Subject key is generated with a weak algorithm or insufficient key length (or other  parameters) for the TSP or subject business requirements   Attack vectors that make the cryptographic algorithms used to generate the subject key pair  insecure are discovered   Subject key is generated in a non-secure physical or logical environment   Usage of insecure or weak random number generator   Selection of weak algorithm (or parameters) the keys are generated for   Subject key generation is not performed by trusted individuals   Unsecure delivery of key pair to subject (Only if CA generates key pair)   Failure to properly verify identity of subject when key pair is delivered (Only if CA generates  key pair)   Unsecure retraction of undeliverable keys  Subjects device provisioning: The subject device (or signature creation device, hardware or  software) is where the subject private key is generated and the cryptographic operations with the  certificates are performed. The security features of the subject device are important to guarantee  confidentiality and integrity of the private key and the cryptographic operations. Inappropriate  security characteristics of the subject’s device for the TSP needed assurance level may lead to  liability of the TSP in case of a breach. When the subject device is a cryptographic device, such as a  token or a smart card, it is usually provisioned by the TSP from an external party, usually a  manufacturer. A source of vulnerabilities would be the failure to verify the authenticity of the  subject’s device or its security features. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s device  provisioning process:   Failure to verify the authenticity of the source of the subject’s device   Inappropriate security characteristics of the subject’s device for the TSP needed assurance  level   Tampering with the subject´s device before it reaches the subject, e.g. during transportation   Failure to properly verify identity of subject when device is delivered   Failure in retracting undeliverable subject´s device   Failure in reusing subject´s device, e.g. improper removal of keys of former subject  Subject key pair usage: Subject key pair activation, both in software or hardware format, should be  protected by PIN or password to ensure that it is not conducted fraudulently. The subject shall, as  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  14  well, handle diligently its key pair to avoid misuse. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s private  key usage are:   Lack of protection measures for the subject key pair activation   Negligent handling of private key by subject   Lack of guidelines to train subject on subject key pair custody  Vulnerabilities in the subject certificate management process  Subject certificate generation and delivery to subject: Certificates are generated by the CA  following standardized formats. The CA then signs the certificate and delivers it to the subject, either  physically or electronically. The CA shall ensure that the certificate is delivered to the legitimate  subject. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s certificate generation process:   Unsecure delivery of certificate to subject   Failure to properly verify identity of subject when certificate is delivered   Tampering with the certificate before it reaches the subject, e.g. during transport   Failure in retracting undeliverable certificate, e.g. revocation   Failure to support subject’s platform properly (i.e. Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc.),  leads to loss of availability.   Failure to generate certificate with correct contents according to policies.  Subject certificate dissemination: Subjects’ certificates may be disseminated to relying parties after  subject consent. Failure of consent may lead to a breach of personal data protection regulations.  Additionally, if the certificate repository is not disseminated with the appropriate security levels,  certificates could be fraudulently accessed. Examples of vulnerabilities in the subject’s certificate  dissemination:   Subject consent is not obtained before disseminating the certificate   Subject certificate repository is not secured   Certificate repository is not up to date  Vulnerabilities in the revocation management process  Certificate revocation management process: The certificate revocation management process deals  with the complete workflow from the request of a revocation by any party to the inclusion of the  revocation in the certificate revocation status service. Vulnerabilities may arise from a lack of a clear  policy that states who can request revocation and under which circumstances. Additionally, the  absence of a policy on the procedure that should be followed may lead to delays in the revocation  that could facilitate a fraudulent use of the certificate. Other vulnerabilities come from a lack of  mechanisms to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of revocation requests which may lead to  forging requests or repudiation of the request by the originator. Examples of vulnerabilities in the  certificate revocation management process are:   Lack of appropriate revocation policies and procedures   Lack of proper enforcement of policies and procedures   Failure to submit revocation request   Insecure certificate revocation request channels   Lack of proper verification of subject identity during revocation request   Lack of measures to guarantee integrity and authenticity of revocation requests  Certificate revocation status dissemination: TSPs disseminate the revocation status of their issued  certificates periodically. The update frequency of the list of revoked certificates should be reflected  in the TSP policies. Failure to disseminate certificate revocation status in the agreed timeframe could  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  15  lead to revoked certificates being used in a fraudulent way. Lack of appropriate security measures to  guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the distributed certificate revocation list may lead to  forgery by a malicious individual. Examples of vulnerabilities in the certificate revocation status  dissemination process are:   Lack of an appropriate revocation list update policy   Lack of enforcement of the revocation list update policy (including frequency)   Insecure dissemination of the certificate revocation list   Failure to update the status of the certificate   Failure to check revocation status by relying parties   Failure (e.g. downtime, DOS) of revocation dissemination service  Vulnerabilities in the validation process  Certificate validation management process: The certificate validation management process deals  with the complete workflow from the request of a validation of a certificate by any party to the  response with the status of the certificate to the requester. Vulnerabilities may arise from a lack of a  clear policy and technical issues on the procedure that should be followed, that may produce delays  or incorrect answers that could facilitate a fraudulent use of the certificate. Other vulnerabilities  come from a lack of mechanisms to guarantee the non-repudiation of the answers. Examples of  vulnerabilities in the certificate validation management process are:   Lack of appropriate validation procedures   Failure to produce and publish CRLs   Differences between OCSP and CRLs responses   Insecure request and response channels   Lack of a logging system to monitor the system status  Vulnerabilities in the time stamping process  Time stamping management process: The time stamping management process deals with the  complete workflow from the request to provide a time stamp token in order to indicate that a data  set existed at a particular point in time. Vulnerabilities may arise from the use of a no trustworthy  source of time or a lack of procedures and policies. Examples of vulnerabilities in the time stamping  process are:   Lack of use of a trustworthy source of time   Insecure request and response channels   Lack of a logging system to monitor the system status  Vulnerabilities in the TSP information and communication systems  TSP software applications: All TSP applications need to be trustworthy, updated and protected. Lack  of protection of TSP applications from malicious software could be exploited by intruders to access  TSP operation related systems, or it could cause accidental malfunction of the systems. Examples of  vulnerabilities in the TSP software are:   Lack of appropriate measures to protect TSP operation from malicious software   Lack of disaster recovery and business continuity plans   Lack of a logical perimeter security to protect TSP systems   Lack of regular bug fixes and updates   Lack of (automated) status testing   Lack of incident response protocols/policies  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  16   Lack of understanding of software security certification, leading to unpatched software due  to certification (Common Criteria) status.  TSP hardware components: For a TSP, hardware vulnerabilities may arise from the lack of  redundancy of hardware in case of a natural disaster, from accidental hardware malfunction or from  hardware deterioration due to natural hazards. Examples of vulnerabilities in the TSP hardware are:   Lack of appropriate measures to protect equipment from environmental threats   Lack of appropriate measures to protect equipment from theft or tempering   Lack of secure equipment storage facilities   Lack of (automated) status testing   Lack of incident response protocols/policies  TSP communication networks: Communication networks are critical in several aspects of the TSP  operation, such as the communication with the RA or the dissemination of the certificate revocation  status. A lack of proper dimensioning of the communication networks of the TSP could lead to the  inability to issue certificates or to publish revocation status. Examples of vulnerabilities in the TSP  communication networks:   Inadequate dimensioning of the communication networks   Lack of logical protection of communication networks   Lack of (automated) status testing   Lack of incident response protocols/policies  TSP systems audit logs: Lack of audit logging procedures on operations conducted over the TSP  systems supporting all business processes could lead to a loss of accountability of users’ actions in  case of a security incident. Even if an appropriate logging policy exists and it is enforced, lack of  protection of logs against accidental or intentional alteration or destruction can have the same  consequences. Examples of vulnerabilities related to audit logs are:   Lack of appropriate audit logging policies   Insufficient protection of audit logs  Vulnerabilities affecting the TSP operation  TSP policies: TSP shall have clear policies regarding the whole certification management processes.  They shall produce, enforce and make available to subjects, at least, a Certification Policy and a  Certification Practice Statement which states their policies, procedures and operational controls.  Examples of vulnerabilities affecting TSP policies are:   Nonexistence of a Certification Policy or a Certification Practice Statement   Certification Policy or Certification Practice Statement don’t match business objectives   Certification Policy or Certification Practice Statement don’t address properly the level of  risk   Lack of an Information Security Policy   Lack of appropriate contractual agreements with external RAs and third parties   Bad policy enforcement   Insufficient policy updates   Policies not made available to concerned parties   CP or CPS don't match 3rd party requirements (for example CA/B Forum requirements for  web certificates)  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  17  TSP operational procedures: TSP policies shall be enforced through operational procedures followed  on daily operations to avoid security incidents. Examples of vulnerabilities affecting CA operational  procedures are:   Lack of Standard Operational Procedures for TSP operations   Lack of Incident Response Procedures   Lack of Business Continuity and Contingency Plans   Lack of quality assurance plans for issued certificates  TSP personnel: TSP personnel, especially those whose work in the TSP operations (trusted roles),  shall have an appropriate level of training and experience in order to avoid potential errors that  could cause compromise or malfunction of systems. A lack of separation of duties or incorrect audit  procedures can lead to abuse of the system without detection by the organization. Examples of  vulnerabilities affecting CA personnel are:   Lack of appropriate training of personnel operating CA related activities   Lack of separation of duties among trusted roles   Lack of enforcement of the information security policy   Lack of clear job descriptions for CA roles   Lack of employment screening of personnel performing trusted roles   Lack of adequate supervision  TSP facilities: Physical vulnerabilities derive from a lack of appropriate protection of the TSP  facilities, especially those dealing with CA operations. Malicious activities in the perimeter or natural  hazards can lead to a compromise or malfunction of TSP systems or assets. Examples of  vulnerabilities affecting TSP facilities are:   Physically insecure CA key generation environment   Lack of a secure perimeter to protect CA operation areas   Lack of protection measures from natural hazards   Lack of contingency plans against loss of essential services  4.6 Identify existing controls  The list of potential vulnerabilities should be contrasted with the list of existing controls. Existing  controls are the means of mitigating the probability of exploiting potential vulnerabilities as they  decrease the level of exposure. The TSP shall conduct a gap analysis to determine for which  vulnerabilities no sufficient controls are in place.  The gap analysis should be an input to conduct the risk calculation. The probability of an incident  scenario taking place is decreased by controls put in place to mitigate vulnerabilities.  This section presents a set of minimum security measures (it can be used ETSI EN 319 412 [11] family  of standards control specific for TSPs or more generic, the ISO 27000 [2] family of standards  controls) that can be used as a reference for all TSPs issuing electronic certificates, regardless of  their certification scope or qualification status.

Therefore,  consequences don’t need to be necessarily negative. Consequences are identified in order to be able  to determine the risk rating. The impact of each incident scenario will be evaluated based on the  consequences it may have for the TSP.  The following list identifies some of the consequences that different incidents may have on the TSP  operation.  Fraudulent issuance of subjects’ certificates: Incidents involving a breach of trust of the CA or the  RA could lead to an issuance of fraudulent subjects’ certificates, which could be used to impersonate  these subjects. This breach, for example, can be due to a compromise in the CA or RA information  system or gaining access to their private keys. This impersonation could be used to intercept private  communications or forge electronic signatures.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  23  Fraudulent use of valid certificates: Incidents related to the subject’s custody of legitimate issued  certificates or vulnerabilities in the subject device or keys can lead to a malicious individual use in  order to impersonate the data subject. This impersonation could be used to intercept private  communications, to forge electronic signatures or to decipher previously encrypted messages.  Fraudulent use of revoked certificates: Incidents affecting the revocation management system  could lead to the inability to process certificate revocation requests, to disseminate their status, etc.  Inability to issue subjects’ certificates: Incidents affecting availability or integrity of the RA or the CA  information systems can lead the TSP not being able to issue new certificates.  Inability to use valid certificates: Some scenarios like the loss of availability of the certificate  revocation status may lead to inability to check the validity of certificates. Compromises of the CA or  RA can also lead to inability to use valid certificates due to the loss of trust or possibility of  compromise.  Inability to revoke certificates: A failure or compromise of the revocation management systems  could lead to subjects’ willing to revoke certificates not being able to do so, which could facilitate  fraudulent use.  Repudiation by certificate subject: Lack of proper registration policies and record preservation can  lead to a subject claiming repudiation of the actions performed with its certificate. Other integrity  compromises in the certification chain may lead to the same repudiation claim.  Loss of accountability of actions: In case of an incident, existing logs, as well as their protection  again manipulation, are an important tool to be able to determine the nature and source of the  incident. Lack of an appropriate level of logging, loss of existing logs or lack of protection of logs can  lead to the impossibility to determine user actions.  Liability: Any security incident or breach of the certification policies that carries a negative effect on  subjects can lead to legal and financial liability for the TSP.  Loss of reputation: Any security incident, especially those affecting the integrity of the CA  operations and the confidentiality of private keys, could cause a loss of reputation of the TSP that  would negatively affect subject trust.  Loss of qualification status: Lack of compliance with qualification requirements, failure to conduct  the necessary audits or negligence in managing the security of the certificate lifecycle can lead to the  loss of qualification status.  4.8 Identify incident scenarios4  Having the input from identified assets, threats, vulnerabilities and consequences, the next step is to  identify the list of risks, formulated like possible incident scenarios. These incident scenarios are  used in the risk assessment, and combined with likelihood and impact finally determine the risk  scenarios.  Examples of incident scenarios are (some incident scenarios are repeated as they may affect more  than one entity):  Incidents affecting CAs   Compromise of a CA  4  Please also refer to the “Guidelines for trust service providers – Mitigating the impact of security incidents”  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  24   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Compromise of the revocation systems   Repudiation claim by certificate subject   Accidental loss of availability of the certification services   Personal data breach  Incidents affecting RAs   Compromise of a RA   Impersonation   Repudiation claim by certificate subject   Personal data breach  Incidents affecting the subject certificate   Compromise of the subject’s key pair   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Repudiation claim by certificate subject   Personal data breach  Incidents affecting VAs   Compromise of the VA   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Accidental loss of availability of the validation services  Incidents affecting TSAs   Compromise of the TSA   Compromise of the cryptographic algorithms or use of inadequate key lengths (or other  parameters)   Accidental loss of availability of the time stamping services  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  25  5 Analyse risk  Once all the parameters that influence the risk calculation have been identified (assets, threats,  vulnerabilities, existing controls, consequences, and incident scenarios) the TSP has enough  information to start the risk analysis process. Risk analysis (the term risk analysis is sometimes  interchanged with risk assessment) is defined as a systematic use of information to identify sources  and to estimate the risk, where source is defined as an item or activity having a potential for a  consequence (ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4]).  Risk assessment also takes into account special circumstances under which assets may require  additional protection, such as with regulatory compliance.  During the risk analysis phase the TSP will use all the identified sources (assets, vulnerabilities,  threats) to estimate the risk, in terms of impact and probability.  5.1 Assess impact  Impact is defined as the result of an unwanted incident (ISO/IEC PDTR 13335-1). Impact can be  measured by the consequences the incident has on the organization assets, for example:   Loss of availability   Loss of integrity   Loss of confidentiality   Loss of accountability   Non legal compliance   Financial loss   Loss of reputation  During the next step of the risk assessment process, the TSP needs to determine the possible  consequences of each identified incident scenario and the impact it would have on the TSP assets.  For this purpose, a mapping between the identified incident scenarios and the consequences should  be undertaken, in order to link each incident scenario with its possible consequences. Based on the  potential consequences, for each incident scenario the level of impact can be determined.  In June and July 2013 ENISA conducted a questionnaire-based survey among trust services providers,  in which 46 participants took part. It had for goal to identify security practices in force at these  organisations5.  The survey asked to rate the potential impact for the trust service providers of identified incident  scenarios. Results are depicted in Figure 2. The values represent the average impact score (from 0 –  “no impact” to 10 – “maximal impact”) assigned by the respondents.  5  For the in-depth description of the study, please refer to the document “TSP services, standards and risk  analysis report”, ENISA 2013. The participants are mentioned in the acknowledgements at the beginning of  this document.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  26  Figure 2: Estimated impact (based on survey results)  5.2 Assess probablility  Probability is defined as the extent to which an event is likely to occur (ENISA). To determine the  probability of occurrence, each incident scenario should be mapped against:   The possible threats that could cause the incident and their probability of occurrence   The vulnerabilities that could be exploited for the incident to take occur   The existing controls in place that mitigate and reduce the exposure to the vulnerabilities  Taking into account all these parameters, each incident scenario should be assigned a probability  score. ENISA survey on security practices of trust services providers asked to rate the identified  incident scenarios in terms of probability of occurrence for any certification service provider (0 – “no  risk”, 10 – “maximal probability”). Probability values in the Figure 3 represent the median impact  score assigned by the trust service providers participating in the survey  8,7  7,6  6,7 6,6  5,7 5,4  4,7 4,5 4,3  0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,0 5,0 6,0 7,0 8,0 9,0  10,0  Es ti  m at  e d  im p  ac t  Level of impact estimation  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  27  Figure 3: Estimated probability (based on survey results)  This figure shows that the probability of a compromise of a CA is quite small taking into account that  this scenario is one of the worst that can happen to a TSP and according to the survey is indicated by  the TSPs that one scenario which is likely to occur is the repudiation claim done by the certificate  subject, mainly, claiming didn´t request for a certificate.  The answers of respondents (depicted by colours) show that the probability of these scenarios is  judged being unlikely to occur.  5.3 Estimate level of risk  Risk estimation is defined as the process used to assign values to the probability and consequences  of a risk (ENISA). The level of risk is determined as a combination of the expected impact of the  incident and the likelihood of occurrence. Different weighting scores can be assigned to the assigned  impact / likelihood pair of each incident scenario.  Based on the identified impact and probability scores on ENISA survey responses, the identified risks  would have the level of risk depicted on the Figure 4 (values as on Figures 2 and 3).  4,0  3,8  3,5 3,4  3,1 2,9  2,7  2,4  0,9  0,0  0,5  1,0  1,5  2,0  2,5  3,0  3,5  4,0  4,5  ES ti  m at  e d  p ro  b ab  ili ty  Risk probability estimation  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  28  Figure 4 Risk level estimation (based on survey results)  This figure shows the level of impact caused by these possible scenarios and indicates that the  compromise of a CA has the highest level of impact in the TSP business followed by a compromise of  the cryptographic algorithms.  On the other hand, the compromise of a subject key pair and the claiming to repudiate the  certificate subject has a low level of impact in the TSP business.  This level of risk shall be reduced by applying the correspondent countermeasures.  0,0  2,0  4,0  6,0  0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 4,0 5,0 6,0 7,0 8,0 9,0 10,0  P ro  b ab  ili ty  Level of impact  Risk estimation  Compromise of the Certificate Authority Compromise of the Cryptographic Algorithms Compromise of a Registration Authority Compromise of the Revocation Services Personal Data Breach Impersonation  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  29  6 Evaluate risk  Risk evaluation is the process of comparing the estimated risk against given risk criteria to determine  the significance of risk (ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4]).  Risk criteria can include associated cost and benefits, legal and statutory requirements, socio- economic aspects, the concerns of stakeholders, priorities and other inputs to the assessment  (ISO/IEC Guide 73 [4]). Risk criteria are closely linked to the TSP business environment and should be  determined by the TSP.  To support the risk evaluation process, we have produced examples of evaluations, based solely on  the risk estimation, of the main risks TSPs face, which can be found below. The list is informative and  should only be used as a reference. The TSP shall produce their own risk universe which corresponds  to its actual business and operational environment, including the risk criteria of its own organization  in the final evaluation.  For each identified risk, a description and a characterization has been made, in order to provide a  better understanding of the factors the that can have any effect on the potential materialization of  the risk. The following factors have been taken into account:   Description: Brief description of the characteristics of the identified risk and its likelihood  and impact score.   Related assets: Examples of the assets that could be affected by the incident scenarios  involved in the risk.   Possible vulnerabilities: Examples of vulnerabilities that, if being exploited, could lead for a  materialization of the risk.   Potential threats: Examples of threats that could cause the materialization of the risk.   Possible consequences: Examples of consequences that the materialization of the risk could  have.

Security management ensures that the risks are identified and an adequate control environment is  established to mitigate these risks. There is a need to manage the risks by defining and controlling  threats and vulnerabilities. To achieve this, it is important to understand the principles behind the  management of risk and the concepts underlying the risk management process.  The choice of the appropriate methodology to perform the risk assessment should be made by the  organisation itself. This study has provided a general overview of how a risk assessment can be  conducted and how to identify risks specific to trust service providers. It can serve as a guide to  assist providers when conducting an assessment.  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  40  Annex 1 – Definitions  Asset: any person, facility, material, information or activity that has value to the organization, its  business operations and their continuity, including Information resources that support the  organization's mission.  Authentication: process that allows the validation of the electronic identification of a natural or  legal person; or of the origin and integrity of an electronic data;  Certificate: Electronic attestation which links electronic signature or seal validation data of a natural  or a legal person respectively to the certificate and confirms those data of that person;  Certification Authority: An entity trusted to issue certificates. A certification service provider may  have one or several Certificate Authorities. It is generally a trusted party or trusted third party that  accepts the responsibility of managing the certificate process by issuing, distributing and verifying  certificates.  Certification Service Provider: An entity or a legal or natural person who issues certificates or  provides other services related to electronic signatures.  Contingency Plan: A plan for emergency response, backup operations, and post-disaster recovery in  a system, as part of a security program, to ensure availability of critical system resources and  facilitate continuity of operations in a crisis.  Cryptographic module: An umbrella term covering:   cryptographic algorithms (e.g. encryption, hashing, key generation, ...)   cryptographic parameters (e.g. key length, elliptic curve, ...)   cryptographic protocols (e.g. key exchange, ...)   cryptographic implementations (e.g. software libraries, HSMs, …)  Data Availability: The fact that data is accessible and services are operational. It can be described as  the property of being accessible and useable upon demand by an authorized entity. In the context of  service level agreements, availability generally refers to the degree to which a system may suffer  degradation or interruption in its service to the customer as a consequence of failures of one or  more of its parts.  Data Confidentiality: The protection of communications or stored data against interception and  reading by unauthorized persons. Confidentiality means keeping the content of information secret  from all entities except those that are authorized to access it.  Data Integrity: The confirmation that data which has been sent, received, or stored are complete  and unchanged, which implies that the items of interest (facts, data, attributes etc.) have not been  subject to manipulation by unauthorized entities.  Electronic seal: Data in electronic form which are attached to or logically associated with other  electronic data to ensure the origin and the integrity of the associated data; (Proposal eSignatures)  Electronic Signature: Data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated to other  electronic data and serves as a method of authentication.  From a legal perspective, an electronic signature is not necessarily considered equivalent to a  handwritten signature. When it meets a number of conditions, it can be put on par with a  handwritten one.  Event: Occurrence of a particular set of circumstances  Risk assessment  Guidelines for trust services providers – Part 2  Version 1.0 – December 2013  Page  41  Evidence: Information that either by itself or when used in conjunction with other information is  used to establish proof about an event or action. Evidence does not necessarily prove truth or  existence of something but contributes to establish proof.  Hash Function: A mathematical function which maps values from a large (possibly very large)  domain into a smaller range. A \"good\" hash function is such that the results of applying the function  to a set of values in the domain will be evenly distributed and apparently at random over the range.  Impact: The result of an incident.  Incident: An event that has been assessed as having an actual or potentially adverse effect on the  security or performance of a system.  Mitigation: Limitation of any negative consequence of a particular event  Probability: Extent to which an event is likely to occur.  Private Key: In a public key cryptosystem, that key of a user's key pair which is known only by that  user  Public Key: In a public key cryptosystem, that key of a user's key pair which is publicly known.  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): The infrastructure able to support the management of public keys  able to support authentication, encryption, integrity or non-repudiation services.  Relying Party: A user or agent that relies on the data in a certificate in making decisions.  Risk: The potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and  thereby cause harm to the organization.  Risk Analysis: A process that examines an organization´s information resources, its existing controls,  and its remaining organization and computer system vulnerabilities.  Risk Assessment: A process used to identify and evaluate risk and their potential effects  Risk Management:  The discipline of identifying and measuring security risks associated with an  information system, and controlling and reducing those risks to an acceptable level. The goal of risk  management is to invest organizational resources to mitigate security risks in a cost-effective  manner, while enabling timely and effective mission accomplishment.  Signature Creation Data: Unique data, such as codes or private cryptographic keys, which are used  by the signatory to create an electronic signature  Signature Creation Device: Configured software or hardware used to create an electronic signature  Subject: Entity identified in a certificate as the holder of the private key associated with the public  key given in the certificate.  Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an asset through  unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of service.

risk assessment phases defined in [2]are followed:   Risk identification: Identifying the different factors (assets, threats, vulnerabilities,  consequences and incident scenarios) that will identify and evaluate the risks:  o System scope delimitation: Determining the scope included in the risk assessment  and its boundaries  o Asset identification: Identifying any type of item that has value to the organization  and that could cause damage if it is involved in an incident.  o Threat analysis: identifying all agents, either natural or human made, accidental or  intentional, internal or external, that could pose a threat to the organization.  o Vulnerability analysis: Identifying all potential weakness in the organization that  could facilitate a successful attack and cause damage to the assets.  o Consequence determination: Identifying the possible consequences that different  events could have on the organization.  o Incident scenario identification: Determining the possible events that could have an  impact on the organization and that will serve as a base to identify the risks.   Risk analysis: Determining the risk level based on the impact of each incident scenario and  their probability of occurrence.   Risk evaluation: Producing a scored list of all the identified risks, based on the risk analysis  results; the business criteria; the affected assets and their vulnerabilities and the potential  threats.

Beyond the consequences that this pandemic is  bringing to our everyday lives, the crisis has also affected cyber incidents. ENISA has been called  upon to support Europe during these testing times by making recommendations to the critical  infrastructure industry, supporting the EU Tracing Apps Toolbox, providing cybersecurity advice  to SMEs and guidance to the healthcare sector against the increase of phishing campaigns  and ransomware attacks. ENISA is raising awareness of its cybersecurity recommendations  on a variety of topics including working remotely, shopping online, and e-health; and with  the support of its partner’s issues weekly situation reports of on-going cyber incidents. In  addition, the CSIRTs Network being placed on high alert required increased support by the  Agency. Through protecting our critical infrastructure, public outreach and creating a common  situational awareness, ENISA has thus far played its role in preventing malicious cyber actors  from taking advantage of the health pandemic and turning it into a large scale cyber pandemic.  This document presents the amended Work programme of the Agency for 2020, which takes  account of changes required to respond to Covid-19.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  1  10101  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 11  The mission of ENISA has been to contribute to  securing Europe's information society by raising  awareness of network and information security and  to develop and promote a culture of network and  information security in society for the benefit of  citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector  organizations in the Union.  ENISA was founded in 2004 to contribute to the  overall goal of ensuring a high level of NIS within the  EU by acting as a centre of expertise and supporting  the Member States in capacity building.  In 2019, the mandate1 of the Agency has been  extended and the role of ENISA has been reinforced  within the EU cybersecurity landscape. ENISA  supports the European Institutions, the Member  States and the business community in addressing,  responding to and especially in preventing network  and information security problems. It does so  through a series of activities across six areas:  Expertise: assess and improve  Europe's knowledge in addressing emerging  cybersecurity challenges.  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and  communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act), OJ L  151, 7.6.2019, p. 15–69, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/ reg/2019/881/oj  Policy: support cybersecurity policy making and  implementation in the Union.  Capacity: support capacity building across the  Union (e.g. through trainings, recommendations  and awareness raising activities).  Cooperation: foster the cooperation within the EU  cybersecurity community (e.g. by supportingfthe  CSIRTs activities and network, coordination of  pan-European cyber exercises).  Certification: support the implementation of the  cybersecurity certification framework for ICT  products, services and processes.  Enabling: reinforcing ENISA’s impact and efficiency  (e.g. through engagement with the stakeholders  and international relations).  The area ‘Certification’ represents a new activity for  ENISA and is an outcome of the Cybersecurity Act.  In line with these objectives and tasks, the Agency  carries out its operations in accordance with  an annual and multiannual work programme,  containing all of its planned activities, drawn up  by the Executive Director of ENISA and adopted by  ENISA’s Management Board (MB).  ENISA’s approach is strongly impact driven, based  on the involvement of all relevant stakeholder  communities, with a strong emphasis on pragmatic  solutions that offer a sensible mix of short-term  and long-term improvements.

I  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 15  THREAT LANDSCAPE  2018 brought significant changes for the cyberthreat  landscape and the forecasting capability of  ENISA. These changes were triggered by discrete  developments in motives and tactics of the most  important threat agent groups, namely cyber- criminals and state-sponsored actors. Monetization  motives have contributed to the appearance of  crypto-miners in the top 15 threats. State-sponsored  activities have led to the assumption that there is  a shift towards reducing the use of complex malicious  software and infrastructures and going towards low  profile social engineering attacks.  Developments have also been made by the  defenders. Through the emergence of active  defence, threat agent profiling has led to a more  efficient identification of attack practices and  malicious artefacts, thus leading to more efficient  defence techniques and attribution rates. Initial  successes have been achieved through the  combination of cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) and  traditional intelligence. This is a clear indication of  the need to open CTI to other related disciplines to  increase the quality of assessments and attribution.  Finally, defenders have increased the levels of  training to compensate skill shortage in the area  of CTI. The high interest of stakeholders in such  trainings is a clear indication for their appetite in  building capabilities and skills.  Recent political activities have underlined the  emergence of various, quite novel developments  in the perceived role of cyberspace for society and  national security. Cyber-diplomacy, cyber defence and  cyber-war regulation have dominated the headlines.  These developments, when transposed to actions,  are expected to bring new requirements and new use  cases for CTI. Equally, through these developments,  currently existing structures and processes in  the area of cyberspace governance will undergo  a considerable revision. These changes will affect  international, European and Member States bodies. It  is expected that threat actors are going to adapt their  activities towards these changes, thus affecting the  cyberthreat landscape in the years to come.  In summary, the main trends in the  2018’s cyberthreat landscape are:  Mail and phishing messages have become the  primary malware infection vector.  Exploit Kits have lost their importance in the  cyberthreat landscape.  Cryptominers have become an important  monetization vector of cyber-criminals.  State-sponsored agents increasingly target banks  by using attack-vectors utilised by cyber-crime.  Skill and capability building are a major focus for  the defenders. Public organisations struggle with  staff retention due to strong competition from the  industry in attracting cybersecurity talents.  PART I GENERAL CONTEXT  16  Technical orientation of cyberthreat intelligence is  an obstacle towards awareness raising at the level  of security and executive management.  Cyberthreat intelligence needs to respond to  increasingly automated attacks through novel  approaches due to utilization of automated tools  and skills.  The emergence of IoT environments will remain  a concern due to missing protection mechanisms  in low-end IoT devices and services. The need for  generic IoT protection architectures/best practices  will remain pressing.  The absence of cyberthreat intelligence solutions  for low-capability organisations/end-users needs  to be addressed by vendors and governments.  All these trends are evaluated and analysed against  the content of the ENISA Threat Landscape Report  2018 (ETL 2018). Open issues based on these  trends will be identified. Additionally, ENISA will  propose measures to be taken in the areas of policy,  business and research/education.  They serve as  recommendations and will be taken into account for  future activities of ENISA and its stakeholders.  Regarding all these developments, ENISA has  identified numerous activities to address current  trends in the cyberthreat landscape and increase  knowledge and capability levels for different  stakeholder groups. The content of the present  programme document aims at activities that will result  in less exposure to the aforementioned cyberthreats.  POLICY INITIATIVES  Since its foundation in 2004, ENISA, has actively  contributed to raising awareness of NIS challenges  in Europe, the development of MS NIS capacities and  the reinforcement of the cooperation of MS and other  NIS stakeholders.  NIS are high on the EU policy agenda, particularly  in the European Cybersecurity Strategy (2013), the  European Cyberdefence Policy Framework (2014) and  in the European Digital Single Market (DSM) (2015).  ENISA will continue to accompany the efforts of the  Member States and EU institutions in reinforcing  NIS across Europe. In particular, the recent adoption  of the European Directive of  the European  Parliament and the Council on measures to ensure  a high common level of network and information  securitycalls for an increased commitment by  ENISA to support a coherent approach towards NIS  across Europe.  With the adoption of the NIS Directive (2016), the  fields of action were extended to accompany the  evolution of NIS in Europe. ENISA plays a key role in  the following activities in particular:  contributing to the NIS technical and operational  cooperation by actively supporting cooperation  between Member States CSIRTs within  the European CSIRTs Network and the NIS  Cooperation Group;  providing input and expertise for collaboration  between competent national authorities at policy  level in the framework of the cooperation group  established by the NIS Directive;  supporting the strengthening of the NIS of EU  institutions in close cooperation with CERT-EU and  the institutions themselves.  In parallel, ENISA will continue to contribute to the  reinforcement of NIS as a driver of the DSM and more  generally of economic growth in Europe, including the  development of NIS and related ICT industries.  The publication of the new EU cybersecurity package  on 13 September 2017 with its set of legislative  and non-legislative measures has identified ENISA  as a key pillar of the EU’s ambition to reinforce  cybersecurity across Europe, which is documented  in the Cybersecurity Act, which provides for the  strengthening  of ENISA.  In addition to strengthening ENISA, the Cybersecurity  Act creates a framework for European Cybersecurity  Certification schemes with to the aim of creating  a digital single market for ICT products, services and  processes. ENISA will play a significant role in the  preparation of the candidate schemes, contributing to  the harmonisation of the EU cybersecurity certification.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 17  PART I. General context  II  This section reflects mid-term priorities that should  guide the activities of the Agency for the next  three years.  Priorities are completed with indications on  Guidelines which should underpin  ENISA’s implementation of the Multi-annual and  annual programming document.

ACTIVITY 1 – EXPERTISE. ANTICIPATE AND  SUPPORT EUROPE’S KNOWLEDGE IN FACING  EMERGING CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  Objective 1.1. Improving knowledge on  the security of digital developments  Output O.1.1.1 – Building knowledge on the  security of Internet of Things  The Agency has been working on IoT security for  a number of years, creating, among other things,  baseline IoT security recommendations5 (WP2017),  sectoral work in Industry 4.0/smart manufacturing6  (WP2018), secure development guidelines (WP2019),  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline- security-recommendations-for-iot  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good- practices-for-security-of-iot  PART III WORK PROGRAMME  FOR 2020  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot  32  etc. With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security  and privacy, the IoT threat landscape is extremely  complex and wide. Therefore, it is important to  understand what exactly needs to be secured and to  implement specific security measures to protect the  IoT from cyber threats. Moreover, the Agency is in line  with the priorities of the EC for the next 5 years7.  Building on its previous work on IoT security,  the Agency will identify and analyse existing IoT  security practices, national expertise, regulatory  initiatives and standards that aim at protecting the  IoT ecosystem as a whole. The Agency will map the  evolving threat landscape to these practices and  standards to develop guidelines for improving the  IoT security, focusing on its impact on the consumers  and the overall supply chain (for example 3rd party  dependencies, integration of components, etc.) –  particularly in the context of Industry 4.0 and smart  infrastructures.  To meet these goals, the Agency will take existing EU  policy and regulatory initiatives (the NIS Directive,  the Internet of Things - An action plan for Europe,  the Communication on Building strong cybersecurity  for the EU, the Public Private Partnership (PPP) on  cybersecurity, etc.) into account and contribute to  them. ENISA will work with relevant stakeholders  (public and private sector, national cybersecurity  agencies, and EU funded IoT research projects) and  EU initiatives (e.g. AIOTI).  The Agency will consider developing targeted IoT  case studies to identify risks and attack scenarios,  and provide relevant recommendations and good  practices. Accordingly, it will consider defining e.g.  secure IoT procurement guidelines to support  consumers, IoT supply chain security guidelines  or other means to raise awareness and to ensure  “security for safety” .  ENISA will also validate the results of the study (e.g.  via joint workshops) with relevant IoT stakeholders.  Output O.1.1.2 – Building knowledge on Connected  and Automated Mobility (CAM)  The automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm  change towards connected and autonomous  vehicles. Smart cars that are already available  today provide connected features for added value  to enhance the car users’ experience or improve  their safety. With an increased connectivity (that the  emergence of 5G is expected to promote further)  novel cybersecurity risks and threats arise and  7 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/ political-guidelines-next-commission_en.pdf  need to be addressed. In light of the NIS Directive,  in which road authorities and intelligent transport  systems are among the entities identified as  Essential Service Operators in the road transport  sub-sector, there is a growing need for addressing  the security of smart cars.  The Agency will continue its work on smart cars8  (WP2016, WP2019) and monitor security practices  and standards in the area of smart cars (e.g. UN-ECE  dedicated TF on CYBER, ISO/SAE standardisation  work), taking the emerging notions of connectivity  and autonomy into consideration. ENISA will examine  the security challenges arising from the deployment  of connected and autonomous vehicles as well as  issues such as V2V and V2X communications. The  Agency will review these practices and standards and  highlight or suggest good practices and potential  legislative actions required to guarantee security  of smart cars, focusing on general safety as  well  as connectivity and autonomy.  To assist the European commission and the  Member States in achieving these objectives, the  Agency will evaluate and contribute to existing EU  policy and regulatory initiatives (the NIS Directive,  the European strategy on Cooperative Intelligent  Transport Systems9, the C-ITS Platform of DG MOVE10,  the High Level Group GEAR 203011) as well as the  planned European Commission Recommendation  on Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM), the  3rd Mobility package12, the Communication on CAM  and the relevant work of Euro NCAP. ENISA is in line  with the cybersecurity effort of the joint initiative by  DG MOVE, DG CNCT, RTD and DG GROW established  under the 3rd Mobility package.  To ensure an aligned approach across Member  States, the Agency will support their work within  the NIS Cooperation framework regarding the  identification of the operators of essential services  in the transport sector. It will also support with the  establishment of common follow-up processes  regarding cyberattacks against road infrastructures.  Additionally, the Agency will validate the results of  the study (e.g. via joint workshops) in collaboration  with relevant stakeholders in the field of smart  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security- and-resilience-of-smart-cars  9 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0766  10 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en  11 See https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level- group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and- sustainability_en  12 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2018- 05-17-europe-on-the-move-3_en  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/political-guidelines-next-commission_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/political-guidelines-next-commission_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/3rd-mobility-pack/com20180283_en.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0766 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0766 https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level-group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and-sustainability_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level-group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and-sustainability_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level-group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and-sustainability_en https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2018-05-17-europe-on-the-move-3_en https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2018-05-17-europe-on-the-move-3_en  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 33  PART III.

Output O.1.1.3 – Building knowledge on Artificial  Intelligence security  Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies facilitate  intelligent and automated decision-making and are  thus a prerequisite to the deployment of IoT and  Industry 4.0 scenarios, as well as other application  areas. Interesting showcases of AI include smart  manufacturing (robotics), autonomous driving, smart  cities, etc. Even though undoubtedly beneficial, AI  and its application on automated decision making  –especially in safety critical deployments such as  in autonomous vehicles – can offer new ways for  manipulation and other attacks.  When considering security regarding AI, considerate  needs to be considered that AI can be exploited  to manipulate expected outcomes, but also that  AI techniques can be utilised to support security  operations. Accordingly, adversarial techniques  to manipulate AI algorithms are emerging and  therefore pose a relevant risk that needs to be  taken into account. The manipulation of data input  in AI algorithms is also an area of concern for  cybersecurity, since intentional or unintentional  modifications of can significantly affect the behaviour  of the algorithms. Moreover, the evolutionary  nature of AI algorithms and the need to perform  verifications and even forensics in this complex  field exacerbate cybersecurity concerns, especially  in connection with thheir application in critical  information infrastructures. Conversely, AI is  becoming an important tool for cybersecurity itself,  as it can be used to identify attack patterns and thus  facilitates supervision of security management/policy  implementation and allows forautomated incident  management etc.  The Agency will conduct a study on the challenges  related to AI security taking relevant issues, risks  and solutions into consideration. In doing so, ENISA  will map relevant stakeholders and experts, engage  with the wider community and validate the results  of the study (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant  national and EU initiatives and competent authorities.  Moreover, the Agency will interact with AI stakeholders  from the public sector such as the relevant European  Commission services, etc. ENISA will take stock of  existing initiatives and studies that are ongoing in  the area of AI cybersecurity such as the results of  EU projects in this area (H2020) to avoid duplication  of the efforts, but instead focus on providing  a harmonized view of the ongoing works. ENISA will  also support the EC in upcoming and ongoing policy  initiatives related to the topic such as the coordinated  European approach on artificial intelligence.  Output O.1.1.4 – Building knowledge on the  security of healthcare services  Recent cybersecurity incidents have shown  that healthcare is one of the most vulnerable  sectors. Previous ENISA studies highlighted that  the healthcare sector has a relatively low level of  maturity regarding cybersecurity. Newly adopted  EU legislations have indicated that there has  been a shift in priorities: the NIS Directive defines  healthcare organisations as operators of essential  services, the Medical Devices Regulation13 (MDR)  includes obligatory safety and security provisions  for medical devices and the EC Communication on  enabling digital transformation of healthcare in  the digital single market14 as described in the 2018  communication of the European Commission on data  package15. The Agency supports the actions taken by  the EC to increase health information data sharing  with a strong focus on cybersecurity.  The Agency, based on previous experience, will  support Healthcare organisations in enhancing their  cyber security level by helping them assessing risk  in the healthcare information systems. This work  will enable Healthcare organisations to identify  vulnerabilities and evaluate risks for all assets in  the healthcare ecosystem. The agency will consider  assessing implementation scenarios , e.g. ePrescription  systems, remote patient healthcare, proactive/  13 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/ regulatory-framework_en  14 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care- digital-single-market-empowering  15 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-3364_en.htm  ENISA will take stock  of existing initiatives  and studies that are  ongoing in the area of  AI cybersecurity  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-3364_en.htm  34  predictive approaches to healthcare, mHealth, Cloud  and big data for healthcare services (list is indicative).  The goal is to provide a collection of common practices  for ensuring cybersecurity in interoperable hospital  systems and related care environments.  The emerging situation from the COVID-19 pandemic  affecting the sector will be reflected in all activities on  the topic. Leveraging on previous studies, the Agency  will support  the Commission16 in implementing the  EC toolbox17 on mobile applications to support tracing  in the EU fight against COVID-19.  ENISA will also  encourage stakeholders from this sector to provide  input to the weekly Situational Report (OSINT) during  the difficult times of crisis.  The Agency will also validate the results of the study  (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national  and EU initiatives and interact with healthcare  organisations and policy makers, competent  NIS authorities as well as with experts from the  private sector including operators, integrators  and manufacturers.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the  fields of healthcare security (WP 2015, WP 2019),  smart hospitals (WP 2016) and the NIS Directive  implementation (WP 2017, WP 2019).  Output O.1.1.5 – Building knowledge on maritime  security  The maritime sector plays a key role for the EU  economy and society, accounting for a large segment  of Europe’s overall freight and passenger transport.  However, with the introduction of innovative solutions  based on ICT, the sector has been undergoing a  digital transformation, which is why the cyber risk  profile has changed. Combined with a significant  increase in cyber attacks against key maritime entities  such as ports and shipping companies, this change  highlights the need for cybersecurity to be addressed  in more detail in the maritime sector. As per the  revised EU maritime security strategy action plan,  cybersecurity is important for the sector18.  Accordingly, the Agency will provide maritime  stakeholders (e.g. regulatory authorities,port  authorities, service providers, shipping companies,  vessel manufacturers, solution developers, etc.) with  guidelines for best practices regarding security and  resilience when designing, developing and deploying  16 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/ europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy 17 https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_ en#anchor0 18 https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime- security_en  services to minimise the systems’ and services’ exposure  to all relevant cyber threat categories. The best practices  will take both the current maritime ICT environment  and the emerging trends in terms of business models  and supporting ICT systems into consideration. ENISA  will take stock of current practices and standards and  develop best practices with a focus on resilience of  critical services and user safety, while analysing specific  use cases to determine possible attack scenarios.  ENISA will interact with relevant key stakeholders  from the public sector such as DG MOVE, EMSA,  competent national authorities, and from the  private sector such as managing bodies of ports,  port facilities, water transport companies, vessel  traffic service operators as well as ICT product and  service vendors to collect information and validate  the study’s findings. In particular, due to COVID-19  pandemic and travelling restrictions any necessary  physical workshops will be planned as online events  and the physical event will not take place.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the  fields of maritime (WP2011, WP2019), intelligent  transportation systems (WP 2015) and critical smart  infrastructures (WP 2016).  Output O.1.1.6 – Building knowledge on  cryptographic algorithms  In the revised cybersecurity strategy of the EU  published in September19, the European Commission  highlights “[…] the lack of European capacity on  assessing the encryption of products and services  used by citizens, businesses and governments within  19 European Commission, Joint Communication to the  European Parliament and the Council Resilience, Deterrence and  Defence: Building Strong Cybersecurity for the EU, JOIN(2017)  450, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN  ENISA will interact  with relevant key  stakeholders from  the public sector such  as DG MOVE, EMSA,  competent national  authorities, and from  the private sector  https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strateg https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strateg https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_en#anchor0 https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_en#anchor0 https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime-security_en https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime-security_en http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=JOIN:2017:450:FIN  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 35  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  the Digital Single Market. Strong encryption is the  basis for secure digital identification systems that play  a key role in effective cybersecurity […]”. Furthermore,  in Article 10 of its proposal for a Regulation of the  European parliament and of the Council on ENISA,  the \"EU Cybersecurity Agency\", repealing Regulation  (EU) 526/2013, of 13 September 2017, the European  Commission is calling ENISA to “[…] advise the  Union and the Member States on research needs  and priorities in the area of cybersecurity, with a  view to enabling effective responses to current and  emerging risks and threats, including with respect to  new and emerging information and communications  technologies, and to using risk-prevention  technologies effective”. Encryption is one of the most  important technologies that fulfills the criteria of a  security and privacy enhancing technology.  While acknowledging the importance of crypto  technologies with regard to cybersecurity, particularly  encryption is still a main focus regarding national  security, especially when it comes to the protection  of sensitive governmental systems as well as critical  information infrastructures. To harmonise both –  market needs and Member States responsibilities  – it is essential to collaborate on sharing existing  approaches, best practices and knowledge.  Due to international standardisation, technical  specifications for cryptographic algorithms already  exist; this should be the goal at European level, too.  Moreover, at European level, the so called SOGIS- MRA Crypto catalogue20, a comprehensive collection  of cryptographic means agreed on by participating  competent authorities of the Member States, is a first  major achievement.  Based on a wider promotion of the SOGIS catalogue  and by working closely with the Member States, ENISA  will act as a catalyst to raise awareness on already  existing cryptographic means. Especially in light of the  new EU certification framework where ENISA plays  a significant role, ENISA will continue the discussion  with the existing SOGIS crypto working group on  possibilities of a long-term relationship and exchange  in 2020. ENISA will also continue to participate in  respective meetings of the group.  With regard to standardisation, ENISA should facilitate  the establishment and adoption of European and  international standards for risk management and for  the security of ICT processes, products and services  which includes cryptography.  ENISA could engage with ETSI groups concerned  with cryptography – primarily TC Cyber and its  20 https://www.sogis.org/uk/supporting_doc_en.html  QSC subgroup as well as TC ESI. ENISA could also  promote the findings of these groups by referring to  them on its website. A similar arrangement could be  utilized for relevant CEN/CENELEC standards groups  (primarily JTC-13 as it begins its work).  Objective 1.2. Cybersecurity Threat  Landscape and Analysis  Output O.1.2.1 – Annual ENISA Threat  Landscape report  The annual ETL report  This report will provide an overview of current  threats and their consequences. It contains tactical  and strategic information about cyber threats. It also  includes threat agents and typical attack vectors.  Hence, the ETL is a source of generic Cyber Threat  Intelligence (CTI) by means of interrelated information  objects. The contents of the report are based on an  intensive information collection exercise, followed  by analysis and consolidation of publicly available  information on cyber threats, including annual  incident reports to the NIS cooperation Group under  the NIS Directives, and directly to ENISA under other  EU legislation.  The ETL  provides information regarding the reduction  of the threat exposure. This information will consist  of available controls that are appropriate to reduce  the exposure and consequently mitigate the resulting  risks. In addition to the report, ENISA will make  available to the public all relevant materials collected  during the year.  The dissemination, concise presentation and online  availability of situational cyberthreat intelligence will  be a major focus in 2020. The available situational  cyberthreat intelligence will be linked to other  relevant ENISA results (see also chapter Objective 1.2.  NIS threat landscape description and analysis).  As a result, ETL stakeholders will be able to access  and interact with ENISA cyberthreat information  permanently. In 2020, ENISA will continue its  cooperation with the CERT-EU on threat landscaping.  This includes a collaboration with the relevant  working group in the CSIRTs Network for information  exchanges, use of CERT-EU services and organisation  of common meetings/events. This work also helps  maintaining and expanding synergies with related  experts (i.e. ENISA ETL Stakeholder Group) and  vendors (through MoUs).  https://www.sogis.org/uk/supporting_doc_en.html  36  CTI EU Event  In 2020, ENISA will continue supporting the relevant  Cyberthreat Intelligence stakeholder community by  supporting best practices for CTI and by providing  an interaction platform. This is the main mobilization  instrument for CTI stakeholders; it will facilitate the  dissemination of CTI information of all kinds by ENISA  (e.g. info note).  Maturing of the European cyber threat intelligence  practice through expert/stakeholder participation  Based on its previous work analysing current and  emerging threats, ENISA will promote best practices in  the field of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) by means of  defining a capability framework and a maturity model, in  collaboration with the stakeholder community.  ENISA will prepare a CTI capability framework by  providing hands-on guidelines on how organisations  can revise their cyber resilience strategies by  introducing technical and non-technical context to  their defence capabilities. The proposed framework  consists of a practical tool that helps organisations  of any size and sector to establish a well-definedCTI  program. It will show concrete requirements, a clear  process, outputs and metrics to evaluate the impact.  The aim of this tool is to promote a shift from a  reactive to a proactive way of thinking regarding  cybersecurity by cybersecurity becoming an integral  part of the organisation’s business and risk strategies.  In addition to the above, ENISA will prepare a CTI  maturity model with practical guidelines on how to  evaluate the current state of the CTI program within  an organisation. The purpose of this tool is to help  organisations to evaluate the maturity of the CTI  Program themselvesand, ultimately, being able to  define a roadmap for continuous improvement.  ENISA will promote knowledge and experience  sharing activities between the members of the cyber  threat intelligence community. As a key initiative,  ENISA will organise an annual meeting/event (CTI-EU)  that mobilises experts, academics and the industry to  debate and plan the future of CTI.  Reporting on emerging cybersecurity threats  ENISA will identify best practices regarding future  technological developments to support the research  of emerging cybersecurity challenges and threats  relevant to all organisations. From the outcome of  this research, ENISA will present a methodology and  practical guidelines to streamline a process to create  informed representations of possible future trends  and scenarios. ENISA expects that the methodolgy will  help organisations to promote internal awareness on  emerging cybersecurity challenges and threats and  define proactive mitigation strategies.  Using the methodology above, ENISA will analyse and  report emerging cybersecurity challenges and threats  via an annual research program. The consideration of  future technological trends and challenges is part of  the planning and knowledge management process of  ENISA. The outcome of this research aims at facilitating  the decisionmaking process in setting priorities for  future ENISA work programs and defining thematic  areas aligned with social and economic needs of  citizens and organisations. The ENISA report on future  cybersecurity challenges and threats is essentially a  source of information about emerging technological  trends that may potentially lead to security challenges  and constrains. The report presents possible  mitigation strategies and emerging security solutions  that attempt to anticipate threats and minimize their  impact. To produce this report, ENISA will conduct a  research process over a whole year. It will  include  the input from a variety of sources and contributions  from members of expert and stakeholder groups  (e.g.researchers, academia, representatives from the  civil society and industry). ENISA expects the report to  promote an extensive discussion and raise awareness  on the topics within the cybersecurity community and  the society as a whole.  Output O.1.2.2 – Restricted and public Info notes  on cybersecurity  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and  developments through information notes. Since 2018,  the Agency has been producing two different types of  ‘CSIRT Info Notes’ and ‘General Info Notes’. This will be  continued in 2020.  CSIRT Info Notes  CSIRT Info Notes cover incidents and/or vulnerabilities  concerning the EU that are within the scope of  activities of the CSIRTs Network. Such notes will only be  published having the approval of the CSIRTs Network  whilst respecting its internal procedures.  General Info Notes  General Info Notes cover significant developments  and announcements in the field of cybersecurity with  the sole purpose of promoting general awareness  and presenting actionable mitigation strategies.  General Info Notes are not meant as a response to  incidents or vulnerabilities but rather as explanatory  reviews, neutral and independent analyses of major  events that have reached a certain level of public  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 37  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  and media attention. For creating General Info Notes,  ENISA will consult the CSIRTs Network but also other  appropriate resources.  ENISA provides objective information regarding such  events covering issues, points of action, mitigation  measures, summaries, related practices, etc. Hence,  the aim of these notes is to provide a neutral  overview of the current state and raise awareness  of the essence of the threat by an objective analysis  shortly after the event.  Both types of information notes will be integrated  into the cyber-threat information, thus functioning as  a single knowledge hub.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing information  notes as a reliable and continuous service to its  stakeholders in a timely manner.  Just as with the ETL, ENISA will continue to improve  the dissemination efficiency of the produced CTI  information notes. For this purpose, available  dissemination channels will be used to enhance  adoption among key stakeholders. In addition to  the ENISA website, in 2020 information notes will be  disseminated via the ENISA ETL platform.  Output O.1.2.3 – Support incident reporting  activities in the EU  As EU level incident reporting obligations have  been introduced under multiple types of legislative  instruments, developing efficient reporting schemes  across sectors and geographical borders is one of  the objectives for ENISA in this sector. Such reporting  schemes should be simple, pragmatic and relevant  for the public and private sector respectively without  increasing the cost of operation.  Current and future activities in this area include:  Incident notifications in the telecom sector  (Article 13a of the Telecoms framework directive  to be replaced by Article 40 of the EU Electronic  Communications Code (EECC);ENISA currently  supports the activities of the Article 13a Expert  Group dealing with general surveillance of security  in the telecom sector and producing annual  summary reports on telecom incidents. In this  context, ENISA works closely with several industry  groups and supports the Article 13a expert group  in the analysis of cross- cutting security issues.  The new EECC will require substantial work and  support as the scope of monitoring and reporting  and security breaches will expand.  38  Incident notification for the trust services sector  (Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation): Electronic trust  services are a growing sector and are becoming  increasingly important with many cross-border  dependencies. ENISA plays a key role in the  collection and alaysis of security incidents from  across the EU. In 2020, ENISA will analyse security  incidents and produce a consolidated, anonymised  annual report. In addition, ENISA, in collaboration  with the Member States, will will gather experience  from previous incidents and recommend best  practices. In this context, ENISA also engages with  the private sector and with relevant fora such as  the FESA and the eID expert group.  Incident notifications under the NIS Directive:  In 2018, ENISA provided templates. ENISA will  work with the European Commission and the  Member States to exploit synergies in the different  notification schemes. ENISA will also engage with  the European Commission and competent national  authorities to develop sectoral approaches to  incident notification that best suit each sector. In  this context, ENISA supports the efficient flow of  information on mandatory and voluntary incident  notifications to establish a common picture across  sectors and the EU.  ENISA has extensive expertise in producing  summary incident reports at EU level through  the work with Member States and telecom  providers on the transposition of Article 13a of the  Telecommunications Framework Directive of 2009,  and Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation. In the light  of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, reporting on the  continuity of services in the telecom sector increased  and ENISA will analyse further this information under  the request of the sector or under the request of the  Member States.  Output O.1.2.4 – Supporting PSIRTs and NIS  sectoral incident response expertise  For this particular output, ENISA, supporting the MS,  will collect and analyse best practices for sectoral  CSIRTs and product CSIRTs (PSIRTs) to support  incident response (IR) expertise implementation  according to the Annex I and Annex II requirements of  the NIS Directive.  ENISA will also support the dissemination of PSIRT  and sectoral IR best practices. This will enable  stakeholders to better adopt NISD CSIRT requirements  in their businesses and reinforce cooperation with  product CSIRTs (PSIRT). All this will enable more  efficient incident management practices and will thus  contribute to a more agile adaptation of established  CSIRT expertise and collaboration practices on  incidents, threats and vulnerabilities in the EU.  Objective 1.3. Research & Development,  Innovation  Output O.1.3.1 – Supporting EU research &  development programmes  ENISA will continue providing analyses of the areas  covered by the NIS Directive, the Cybersecurity  Package, the COM decision on cPPP and the  outcomes of relevant Horizon2020 projects, e.g. the  CSA projects (cyberwatching, AEGIS and EU-Unity),  and will aim at showing where funded R&D activities  in the context of H2020, TRANSITS and GEANT  would achieve the greatest impact. ENISA will work  in close cooperation with the respective European  Commission services on cybersecurity aspects related  to the General Data Protection Regulation. The  Agency will also monitor and analyse cybersecurity  related directives and initiatives in various sectors  (e.g. space, maritime, defence, transport, automotive)  and evaluate the specific threat landscape in these  critical sectors.  ENISA will adapt the current best practices and  guidelines for protecting EU systems and networks,  services, IoT and cloud ecosystems as well as supply  chains according to the evolving threats in addition to  building specific used cases that can be adopted by  the IT Security community.  Additionally, ENISA will continue supporting and  advising the European Commission, organisations  in this area, other agencies (e.g. EDA, ESA), industrial  communities and the Member States to meet their  goals by provding its concrete NIS policy expertise.  The Agency will also be make contributions regarding  the proposal on the creation of the Cybersecurity  Competence Network with a European Cybersecurity  Research and Competence Centre21. In this  context, ENISA will work closely with the European  Cybersecurity Research and Competence Centre for  the network to be set up.  21 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/ PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 39  PART III.

Supporting EU policy  development  Output O.2.1.1 – Supporting policy developments  in NIS Directive sectors  While the NIS Directive addresses elements of  cybersecurity in different sectors (OESs and DSPs),  there are several initiatives at EU and MS level that  involve cybersecurity and are orthogonal to the  work conducted in the context of the NIS Directive.  An indicative yet not exhaustive list of examples  includes the work from DG MOVE on the Cooperative  Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS), the work  from EASA on the introduction of requirements for  the management of information security risks by  organisations involved in civil aviation activity, the  work from DG FISMA and ECB on finance-related  regulations, DG GROW’s work on the Medical  Devices Regulation (MDR), the work of DG SANTE  in the eHealth Network (eHN) and the Joint Action  Plan, as well as forthcoming work from DG ENER on  cybersecurity for the energy sector.  Taking into account recent legislative and policy  developments in sectors that are defined in the  NIS Directive (OESs and DSPs), ENISA will work with  the European Commission, Member States and EU  agencies to promote coordinated efforts for sectoral  cybersecurity in the EU. Any planned activity in the  field of cybersecurity in sectors of the NIS Directive  that is foreseen in the WP will respect existing EU  and national efforts and interests, while taking  the ongoing legislative process into consideration.  Restrictions and further requests stemming from  the COVID-19 pandemic will be reflected in the  corresponding activities.  The Agency will provide support to the European  Commission and the Member States regarding  policies related to sectors of the NIS Directive by  stocktaking of the different initiatives from the  different sectors. In doing so, the Agency will map  policies affecting the NISD sectors and the role and  responsibilities of the involved actors. The results  of this mapping will be validated by all related  stakeholders. Moreover, upon request, the Agency  will support the development of relevant policy  initiatives with the aim to ensure coordinated efforts  across the EU.  Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy  implementation  Output O.2.2.1 – Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public  and private bodies in implementing the eIDAS  Regulation by addressing risk, assurance and  technology aspects to provide dependable trust  and electronic identification services. Aspects to  be covered will be discussed with the European  Commission and Member States through the eIDAS  experts group. Interaction with actors from the  private sector will enhance the Agency’s ability to  make further meaningful contributions to this area.  By implementing the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA will  offer analytical support, thus supporting the efforts  of the Member States and the European Commission  in the field of electronic identity. To produce  specific implementation guidelines and technical  recommendations, a number of stakeholders and  collaboration areas will be consulted to address  operational aspects of trust service providers,  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 41  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  conformity assessment bodies and supervisory  authorities while leveraging past experiences to  emphasise implementation and interoperability.  ENISA will also collaborate closely with the eIDAS  Expert Group (Trust Services) and the Cooperation  Network (established by the European Commission  Implementing Decision 2015/296) to exchange  information and share best practices. These  recommendations will complement the existing  knowledge base that ENISA already created for the  trust service providers.  ENISA will take the recommendations and standards  developed by CEN/CENELEC, ETSI and the ISO and  IEC into account and seek to avoid duplication and  conflict of the approaches. In this regard, ENISA  will support the European Commission to assess  applicable standards by reviewing them to decide  to what extent they meet the requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation. Furthermore, ENISA will continue  to support the European Commission, as appropriate,  with the implementation of specific areas of interest  such as qualified time stamps, qualified website  authentication certificates, mobile applications etc.  Lastly, ENISA will support the European Commission  with the implementation aspects and tasks related  to Article 49 of the eIDAS as well as the review of  the eIDAS Regulation to an extent that needs to be  identified by the Commission.  Output O.2.2.2 – Supporting the implementation  of the work programme of the Cooperation Group  under the NIS Directive  ENISA has been supporting the European  Commission and the MS with the development  of the NIS Cooperation Group’s 2018-2020 work  programme. It will contribute to the discussions  and assist the European Commission and MS in  the development of the Cooperation Group’s work  programme 2020-2021. In this context, supporting  the NIS Cooperation Group, ENISA will also analyse  specific issues and draft working papers, consult with  competent authorities of the Member States’ and  collect and develop best practice recommendations.  ENISA will leverage its expertise in Critical Information  Infrastructure Protections, National Cyber Security  Strategies, CSIRTs, security assessment frameworks,  baseline security requirements and incident  notification in different critical sectors (such as  energy, transport, finance etc.), standardisation, ICT  certification and others to contribute to the different  work streams of the Cooperation Group. Contribution  refers to both the existing and ongoing work streams  on, e.g. security measures, incident reporting, energy  sector security, large scale incident taxonomy, etc.,  as well as forthcoming ones that will be specified  and discussed for the Cooperation Group’s  work programme.  ENISA will also take stock of experience gained in  the first two years of the implementation of the  NISD and will recommend best practices for the  implementation of the Directive to the Cooperation  Group and the Ëuropean Commission.  Taking into account the evolving threat landscape  and the experience gained from the implementation  of the NISD, ENISA will continue supporting the  European Commission and the Member States with  the overview of the NISD implementation and its  evaluation by the Member States and the European  Commission. In this respect, ENISA will support the  European Commission and the MS by leveraging the  input from the Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs  Network (in its capacity as the Secretariat for the  CSIRTs Network, ENISA will facilitate the preparation  of the next evaluation report for the Cooperation  Group – Output 4.2.1) evaluating the implementation  of the NISD and contribute to the discussions on the  development of potentially forthcoming regulatory  and/or policy initiatives.  Output O.2.2.3 – Contribute to the EU policy in the  area of privacy and data protection with technical  input on cybersecurity related measures  Within the scope of its cybersecurity mandate,  ENISA will support and promote trust and security  in digital services regarding privacy and data  protection. In close cooperation with institutional  (European Commission, EDPS) stakeholders and  the MS, including the European Data Protection  Board (EDPB), ENISA  will work within its mandate  to support the technical analysis of cybersecurity  measures, e.g. technical and organisational measures  and mechanisms relevant to data protection  ENISA will take the  recommendations and  standards developed  by CEN/CENELEC,  ETSI, ISO and IEC into  account and seek to  avoid duplication  42  by design and by default (such as for example  pseudonymisation and anonymisation techniques),  security of processing, security and integrity of  networks and electronic communication services,  etc. ENISA will further extend its cooperation with  the Data Protection Authorities of the Member States  and with the EDPB and support their cybersecurity  requirements in the field of personal data protection  and privacy. Most importantly, ENISA will continue  contributing in a technical capacity to the work of the  EDPB, as it already did by supporting the European  Commission since 2019.  Currently, in its 8th edition, the Annual Privacy  Forum (APF) will remain the instrument of choice to  gather key communities, namely policy, academia  and industry, in the broader area of privacy and  data protection while focusing on privacy related  application areas. Cooperation activities with  European Data Protection Supervisors, the European  Data Protection Board and national Data Protection  Authorities will be pursued further.  Output O.2.2.4 – Guidelines for the European  standardisation in the field of ICT security  Building on its own policy work, existing standards and  the requirements of the Member States, this activity  will seek to make a gap analysis available and/or  provide guidance to implement existing NIS standards.  Additionally, ENISA manages the relationship it has  developed with the EU SDOs (CEN/CENELEC and ETSI)  and with international standardisation organisations  (ISO and IEC) by contributing to standardisation  work at the strategic and tactical levels (e.g. by  joining appropriate working and management  groups, observing relevant technical and conference  programme committees and co-organising conferences  etc.). New requirements primarily associated with the  implementation and secondly transposition of the EU  legal instruments in place in the Member States will  be taken into account, including aspects of the NIS  Directive, the Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, as well as the  preparation for the upcoming ePrivacy Regulation, etc.  This output will analyse gaps and, in particular, provide  guidelines for  the development or amendment of  standards, facilitating the promulgation and adoption  of NIS standards. ENISA provides its technical and  organisational NIS know-how, which can be further  leveraged to extend or assess standards to render  them more appropriate to stakeholders. By bringing  its concrete NIS policy expertise to the table, ENISA  will produce “how to” and “what else” guides in to  contribute to the European standardisation.  ENISA will thus, where appropriate, discuss that  matterwith the Member States, industry and standard  developing organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN, CENELEC), as  well as European Commission services and agencies  with policy competence.  Output O.2.2.5 – Supporting the implementation  of the European Electronic Communications Code  The European Electronic Communications Code  (EECC), replacing the current Telecom framework  directive that was in place since 2009, brings  important changes to the electronic communications  landscape and to the work of the telecom regulators  across the EU. The new code was adopted in 2018  and is expected to bring more harmonisation at  EU level and several improvements regarding the  security such as:  broadens the scope of application to include  number-independent (Ni) interpersonal  communications services (commonly known as  Over-The-Top (OTT) services),  a broader definition of security incidents, which  is aligned with the definitions in the NIS Directive  and in eIDAS, which will result in more types of  incidents being reported.  In light of the potential impact of the pandemic  on the resilience and availability of electronic  communications, ENISA will support competent  authorities of the Member States with the transition,  the new supervision tasks, and liaise with relevant  industry players to support an effective, efficient  and streamlined implementation of the security  requirements (Article 40) of the EECC. ENISA will build  on the Article 13a Expert Group and its contacts to the  private sector to define guidelines and best practices.  As the competent authorities for the EECC of many  Member States are the same authorities that  supervise the Digital Service Providers and the Digital  Infrastructure under the NIS Directive, ENISA will  ensure that this output remains closely aligned with  the ongoing NISD work in the relevant NIS Cooperation  Group work-streams.  Output O.2.2.6 – Support the MS in improving the  cybersecurity of 5G networks  Given the actions regarding 5G in 2019, a number of  upcoming activities for 2020 are envisaged. For these  activities, ENISA will deliver technical content in support  of EU-wide 5G actions. Thus, ENISA’s contribution  is the provision of technical evidence needed for  policymaking. ENISA is ready for follow-up activities  under its remit, following the discussions between  the EU Members States and with the European  Commission regarding the toolbox initiative.

SUPPORT  EUROPE MAINTAINING STATE-OF-THE- ART INFORMATION SECURITY NETWORK  AND CAPACITIES  Objective 3.1. Assist Member States’  capacity building  Output O.3.1.1 – Technical trainings for MS and  EU bodies  In 2020, most of the activities in this field aim at  maintaining and extending the collection of best  practice guidelines and trainings for CSIRT and other  operational personnel such as product CSIRT (PSIRT)  or operators of essential services (OES). The Agency  will support the development of national incident  response preparedness of the Member States by  providing best practice guidance on key elements of  NIS capacity building with a focus on CSIRT/PSIRT/ OES trainings and services to improve the skills of  the operational teams and their personnel. ENISA will  further build on the successful work in the field of  ‘training methodologies’.  In detail, the Agency will continue to provide updated  training materials according to the findings of the  stocktaking study for trainings in NISD sectors. As  a result ENISA will be able to provide a new set of a  training materials based on emerging technologies  to reinforce the MS’ operational skills and CSIRT/  PSIRT capacities to efficiently manage cybersecurity  events. A special emphasis is placed on supporting the  MS and EU bodies with concrete guidance (like best  practice materials) and concrete actions (like trainings).  ENISA will also offer, upon request, direct support to  individual Member States to provide technical trainings  and advisories on best effort basis. Last but not least,  ENISA will continue supporting TRANSITS trainings.  In 2020, ENISA will further enhance its methodology,  seminars and trainings on:  a)  core CSIRT services such as incident handling,  digital forensics and vulnerability management,  b) cyber crisis management and,  c) the organisation and management of exercises.  The Agency will provide continuous support and  development of TRANSITS trainings, which is a  positive and important aspect for the capacity  building of the MS. This activity is based on the  recently developed materials and infrastructures  for on site and online trainings on these subjects. In  addition, this activity will cover the delivery of these  trainings upon request.  Output O.3.1.2 – Support EU MS in the  development and assessment of NCSS  The NIS Directive’s priority for the MS is to  adopt a national NIS strategy and to monitor its  implementation. Since 2017, all 28 MS have published  a national NIS strategy. However, in order to align  the objectives of the existing National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS) with the requirements of the NISD,  many MS need to update their current NCSS.  ENISA will continue assisting EU MS to develop their  capabilities in the area of NCSS. The Agency can build  on its work from previous years and will assist the MS to  deploy existing best practices in the relevant fields and  offer targeted assistance on specific NCSS objectives  (e.g. CIIP, creation of PPPs etc.). A priority will be to  support the MS to create a NCSS that is in line with  the priorities and requirements of the NIS Directive.  Each year, the Agency focuses on one of the objectives  of the strategy (e.g. collaboration, CIIP, governance).  ENISA will investigate the activities of the MS and  examine best practices and new potential incentives  such as the sectoral NCSS. In the current situation of  the COVID-19 pandemic, ENISA will analyse the ability  of EU SMEs to cope with cybersecurity issues in a crisis  such as COVID-19 and to provide recommendations for  improvement; cybersecurity topics like how to handle  phishing campaigns or to mitigate ransomware attacks  will be included. SMEs are considered a vital part of  society and business, thus in scope of every NCSS.  ENISA will continue supporting the MS in evaluating  their NCSS and their NIS initiatives. The Agency  will update its NCSS assessment methodology  and validate it with the help of public and private  stakeholders. Then, ENISA will make this assessment  methodology available to the MS to use is whenever  needed for implementation. Finally, ENISA will  enhance the NCSS map.  Output O.3.1.3 – Support EU MS in their incident  response development  In 2020, ENISA will focus its efforts on supporting the  MS to enhance their incident response capabilities by  assisting them with their CSIRT maturity assessments  and enhancements, for example with CSIRTs  Network members‘ peer review maturity evaluation.  In addition, the Agency will continue to monitor the  CSIRT landscape development in Europe and provide  an updated view on the CSIRT landscape and incident  response practice development in Europe. In close  cooperation with the NISD CSIRTs Network and the  Connecting Europe Facility’s MeliCERTes initiative,  the Agency will support the development of national  incident response capabilities of the Member States  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 45  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  by providing recommendations and advisory on key  requirements of NIS capability building with a focus  on the development and efficiency of national and  sectoral CSIRTs. ENISA will also offer, upon request,  direct support to individual Member States to evaluate  and improve their incident response capabilities.  The main objectives of this output in 2020 is to help  MS and other ENISA incident response stakeholders,  such as EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to  develop, implement and enhance their incident  response capabilities and services to meet the  increasing challenges of securing their networks.  Another objective of this output is to further develop  and apply ENISA’s recommendations for CSIRT  baseline capabilities, maturity assessments and  corresponding tools. As a continuous effort, ENISA will  continue supporting cross-border CSIRT community  projects, tool development and the global dialog  about common issues and challenges regarding the  topic of incident response.  Output O.3.1.4 – ISACs for the NISD Sectors  in the EU and MS  For many years, ENISA has been working closely with  the main operators of essential services in the EU. It  has set up several sectoral expert groups covering  sectors such as maritime, finance and health.24  Through this effort and based on this experience  with sectors or sector-specific topics like ICS/SCADA,  ENISA holds a unique position in the EU to fulfil a  key role regarding EU focused ISACs. It is for the  obvious choice for ENISA to continue its activities  from the last 10 years to coordinate, in conjunction  with CEF funding, the further development and  implementation of EU ISACs in the next decade. ENISA  is already cooperating with the European Commission  to develop the ISAC facilities manager concept, which  is based on proposals to develop ISACs references in  the CEF Telecom 2018 Work Programme25.  ENISA has been working on the topic of CIIP since  2010, so it is uniquely prepared to assume a special  role in Pan European sectoral ISAC. Some indicative  (but not exhaustive) examples include:  EU Energy ISAC: ENISA plays a key role in the  development and professionalisation of this  ISAC. ENISA is a full member and responsible for  providing expertise through organising webinars  and educational sessions for its members. In  September 2017 and November 2019, it hosted an  24 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information- infrastructures-and-services  25 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef- telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  ISAC meeting in Athens. The EE-ISAC members are  preferably operators.  EU Financial Institutions ISAC: This ISAC is the  oldest one and ENISA has been actively involved  for many years. It supports the ISAC, for example  by hosting the mailing list. ENISA’s involvement is  mainly to legitimise EU participation. ENISA is an  observer.  EU Rail ISAC: ENISA facilitates the European  Railway operators (infrastructure managers and  railway undertakings) creating the European  Rail ISAC. Currently, more than 23 European  stakeholders and the European Railway Agency  (ERA) participate in this ISAC. ENISA offers  experience and support.  The September 2017 Joint Communication states:  “Some first steps have been taken regarding specific  critical sectors such as aviation and energy through  the creation of EASA and by developing information  sharing and analysis centres. The European  Commission will fully contribute to this approach  with support from ENISA. An acceleration is needed,  particularly, with regard to sectors providing essential  services as identified in the NIS directive.”  ENISA will support the MS during the entire lifecycle  of national/European ISACs by engaging all relevant  stakeholders: competent national bodies, the  private sector, i.e. operators of essential services or  manufacturers, and other relevant bodies. ENISA  will also explore the possibility of synergies across  national ISACs and EU sectoral ones. The Agency  will also consider utilising its sectoral expertise that  it has acquired through past and current efforts to  offer support (upon request) to ISACs by sharing  knowledge, e.g. in the form of webinars and other  means of communicating knowledge. This will help  the private companies operating in numerous MS to  have increased benefits from such a collaboration.  Restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic situation will  be reflected in the corresponding activities (physical  meetings are replaced by online ones).  Objective 3.2. Support EU institutions’  capacity building  Output O.3.2.1 – Liaison with the EU agencies on  operational issues related to CERT-EU’s activities  Since December 2017, ENISA has participated as a  Member of the Steering Board of CERT-EU, as the  representative of EU descentralised agencies that  use the services of CERT-EU. In this context, ENISA  will liaise with the EU agencies on operational issues  related to CERT-EU’s activities particularly through the  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  46  ICTAC (ICT Advisory Committee) of the EU agencies  and generally to ensure that the viewpoints of the  agencies are adequately represented. In this context,  ENISA will also report to the CERT-EU steering board  on the evolution of services required by the agencies.  Output O.3.2.2. – Cooperation with relevant  EU institutions, agencies and other bodies on  cybersecurity initiatives  ENISA has increased the cooperation efforts with a  number of EU institutions and agencies and contributed  to the preparation of activities linked to cybersecurity of  to the Presidencies. In 2020, ENISA will keep intensifying  its cooperation efforts on cybersecurity with EU  institutions and agencies and other relevant bodies  regarding the cybersecurity dimension of their mandate.  This encompasses building on the Memorandum of  Understanding and associated implementation activities  on collaboration with EC3, EDA and CERT-EU. As such,  ENISA will liaise with the relevant EU agencies (26)  (including EASA, EC3, CERT-EU, EDA — including civil/ defence cooperation, EEAS, etc.). In addition to the  organisation of exercises in close collaboration with  Activity 4 (in particular O.4.1.1, O.4.1.2, O.4.1.3 and  O.4.1.5), the relevant EU Agencies will closely collaborate  regarding the establishment of common standard  operating procedures to support the EU Cyber Crisis  Cooperation Framework.  Objective 3.3. Awareness raising  Output O.3.3.1 – European Cyber Security  Challenges  Both the growing need for IT security professionals  and the skills shortage are widely acknowledged. To  help solve this problem, ENISA is supporting national  cybersecurity competitions for students, security  professionals and even non-IT professionals, with the  goal to find new cyber talents and encourage them to  pursue a career in cybersecurity.  It is ENISA's aim to turn the ECSC into one of the largest  EU cybersecurity events, where all EU and EFTA countries  will participate. The ECSC brand should be associated  with Europe’s top cybersecurity talents and, by adding  spinoffs such as hackathons and start-ups camps, ENISA  expects the ECSC to become one of the key incubators of  cybersecurity entrepreneurship in Europe.  26 Memorandum of Understanding between the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), The  European Defence Agency (EDA), Europol’s European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3), The Computer Emergency Response Team for  the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU), available at:  https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/ mou—eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3—23-05-18.pdf  Thus, in order to promote capacity building and  awareness in NIS among youths and future EU MS  cyber security experts, ENISA will continue to promote  and advise the EU MS on hosting national ‘Cyber  Security Challenge’ competitions.  The Agency will also continue supporting to plan  and develop the European Cyber Security Challenge  2020. The goal for 2020 will be to further increase the  interest in this type of event by promoting excellence  in the form of cyber competitions. In the future,  the ECSC’s final competition could be followed by  the creation of a ‘Team Europe’ that will represent  Europe in potentialinternational competitions. To this  extend, ENISA has already established some contacts  with representatives of similar competitions in other  regions outside Europe.  Output O.3.3.2 – European Cyber Security  Month deployment  In 2020, ENISA will continue to support the EU MS in  promoting activities to raisecybersecurity awareness  like the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM). The  ECSM is addresses disparity of cybersecurity practices  across Member States in two stages. The first stage is  to support the Member States to increase awareness  and optimise the behaviour of their citizens to achieve  a solid foundation. The second stage should help to  further lower cybersecurity risks by increasing the  maturity of the citizen’s behaviour at the European level.  ENISA and the European Commission can achieve  the objectives of the European Cyber Security Month  by utilising the pan-European campaign to ensure all  Member States are actively committed to the European  Cyber Security Month and that the industry is involved  as well. The proposed pillars remain the same: support  a multi-stakeholder governance approach; encouraging  common public-private activities; assess the impact of  activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  Output O.3.3.3 – Support EU MS in cybersecurity  skills development  ENISA will promote a series of new activities regarding  cybersecurity skills development which will focus on  identifying current national and EU wide initiatives.  The main output of this activity will be a summary of  existing services and programs in the EU that aim at  enhancing cybersecurity skills among EU citizens, in  general, and cybersecurity experts, in particular. As  part of this program, a skill development scheme and  maturity model will be defined based on existing and  similar frameworks and initiatives.  https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 47  PART III.

The  change was made due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In 2019, ENISA will prepare the plan for the CE2020.  This exercise will closely follow up and build on the  experiences from previous exercises such as CE2018.  CE2020 will focus on testing capabilities and  procedures, namely large-scale incident management  cooperation procedures at EU and national levels.  The crisis escalation scenario will be realistic to  better capture how incidents are being managed  and how cooperation works in real life. The exercise  will include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs network,  single point of contacts and competent authorities  established under the NIS Directive. It will also  focus on at least one essential sector. The exercise  will also be designed to offer the opportunity to  train the different aspects included in the Cyber  Crisis Collaboration Blueprint, that was developed  in collaboration with the European Commission,  while also taking into account the recommendations  provided by the NIS Cooperation Group (e.g. the  ‘cybersecurity Incident Taxonomy’ or those on  ‘Cooperation procedures amongst Member States  and functions and capabilities of the national single  point of contact’). Depending on the resources, in  2021, ENISA will also expand the role of the observers  (introduced in 2018) to add more value for the  exercise overall.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include  the strategic dimensions of the exercise and will be  prepared based on the experiences from CE2019 . To  drive the whole planning process ENISA will assemble  a group of planners from the participating countries  to jointly develop a detailed exercise plan (ExPlan) in  2020 . ENISA will involve planning group during the  whole process and incorporate their input to create  a consented plan. The exercise planning will avoid  overlaps with other major related activities.  ENISA will consult the MS and seek approval of ENISA’s  Management Board after consultation with the  Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs Network  on a possible joint EU-NATO cyber exercise in the  coming years.  Output O.4.1.2 – Support activities for cyber  exercises  In 2014, ENISA started the development of the Cyber  Exercise Platform (CEP). The CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States and  EU Institutions such as: exercise organisation and  management, exercise playground with technical  incidents, map of exercises and hosting the exercise  development community.  In addition, new content and exercise incident  challenges and materials will be developed to keep  up the interest of the stakeholders and make the  CEP a central tool for cybersecurity exercising for  all stakeholders. The CEP platform enables ENISA to  enlarge the user base and thus offer the operational  cyber security communities opportunities to exercise  and gain experience and increase their knowledge .  One way to develop exercise incident materials is to  engage the expert community.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 49  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  Output O.4.1.3 – Support activities for  cybersecurity collaboration with other EU  institutions and bodies  ENISA will work with other EU institutions and bodies  to developcybersecurity collaboration tasks based on  an agreed roadmap.  In particular, ENISA will further develop bilateral and  multilateral cooperation with:  DG Connect  the European Cybercrime Centre at Europol  (Europol/EC3)  the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (INTCEN)  the EU Military Staff Intelligence Directorate  (EUMS INT) and Situation Room (SITROOM),  working together as SIAC (the Single Intelligence  Analysis Capacity)  the European Defence Agency (EDA)  the Computer Emergency Response Team for the  EU Institutions (CERT-EU)  the Emergency Response Coordination Centre in  the European Commission  ENISA will also collaborate with the aforementioned  organisations to build capacities and synergies in the  areas of training, education and cyber skills.  Output O.4.1.4 – Supporting the implementation  of the information hub  Decision-supporting intelligence in the cybersecurity  domain is scarce despite today’s security information  overload27. ENISA is at the crossroads of most, if  not all, public-private, cross-sector cybersecurity  communities in Europe, from the technical to the  strategic level. As indicated in the EC Communication  on building strong cybersecurity for the EU28, ENISA  serves as “the focal point for information and  knowledge in the cybersecurity community”. As  a result, ENISA is in a unique position to leverage  its network to gather information, process it  and promote timely, tailored and highly relevant  situational awareness to support decision-making in  both the public and the private European sectors as  recommended by the EC in the blueprint:  “As part of the regular cooperation at technical level  to support Union situational awareness, ENISA should  prepare the EU Cybersecurity Technical Situation  Report on incidents and threats on a regular basis,  based on publicly available information, its own  27 Scott J., Spaniel D. CISO Solution Fatigue Overcoming the  Challenges of Cybersecurity Solution Overload, Hewlett Packard,  Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology  http://icitech.org/ wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf  28 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/ PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  http://icitech.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf http://icitech.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CISO-Solution-Fatigue.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  50  analysis and shared reports  by the Member States'  CSIRTs (on a voluntary basis) or NIS Directive Single  Points of Contact, the European Cybercrime Centre  (EC3) at Europol and CERT-EU and, where appropriate,  the European Union Intelligence Centre (INTCEN)  at the European External Action Service (EEAS). The  report should be available to the relevant instances of  the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the  HRVP and the CSIRTs Network.”  To support the creation of the EU Cybersecurity  Technical Situation reports and to process the  massive amounts of inputs they require in a  meaningful way, ENISA has initiated the development  of a tool that acts as a cybersecurity news sources  aggregator, provides awareness and assists threat  analysts in drafting cybersecurity reports in 2018.  A first prototype is in place and has been reviewed  by experts from ENISA, different EU institutions and  the private sector to validate its added value for  their work. In 2019, the next development phase will  commence to get a ready to use product by the end  of 2019 or beginning 2020 . The tool is using the latest  developments in AI and natural language processing  to facilitate the creation of EU cybersecurity reports  by providing a specialized cybersecurity search  engine, that monitors trending news regarding  cybersecurity 24/7 and has immediate access to  ENISA’s own work on relevant subjects. Additional  functionalities and improvements will be added  periodically according to the latest technological  evolutions and the users’ needs.  For this particular output, ENISA will rely on  the experiences gained drafting the former EU  Cybersecurity Technical Situation Reports with the  prototype to further develop the Natural Language  Processing features for the tool to transition from  paragraph-based proposals to the production of  meaningful sentences. Similarly, this experience will be  leveraged to improve the Machine Learning algorithms  of the prototype to significantly increase the number  and type of information sources to be monitored.  Output O.4.1.5 – Supporting the EU Cyber Crisis  Cooperation Blueprint  ENISA will support the European Commission  on the implementation and improvement of the  cybersecurity blueprint. As specified in the blueprint:  “The EU Cybersecurity Crisis Response Framework  should in particular identify the relevant […]EU  institutions […] at all necessary levels – technical,  operational, strategic/political – and  develop, where  necessary, standard operating procedures that define  the way in which these cooperate within the context  of EU crisis management mechanisms. Emphasis  should be placed on enabling the exchange of  information without undue delay and coordinating  the response during large-scale cybersecurity  incidents and crises.”  Based on the European Commission’s guidance  and experiences from the EU PACE exercise, ENISA  will drive initiatives to mitigate identified gaps in  cooperation between:  EU cybersecurity stakeholders’ main actors like  DG Connect, the European Cybercrime Centre at  Europol (Europol/EC3), the EU Intelligence Analysis  Centre (INTCEN), the EU Military Staff Intelligence  Directorate (EUMS INT) and Situation Room  (SITROOM) working together as SIAC (the Single  Intelligence Analysis Capacity), the EU Hybrid  Fusion Cell (based in INTCEN), the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions  (CERT-EU), the Emergency Response Coordination  Centre in the European Commission and possibly  the Cybersecurity Emergency Response Fund.  The rest of EU bodies, agencies and institutions  that should be under the EU cybersecurity  blueprint umbrella for handling and mitigation of  cyber oriented crises.  ENISA will drive working groups to initiate or  continue developing procedures in the context of  the blueprint, from defining emergency directories  and update processes to structuring cooperation  activities during crises. This are the priorities named  listed in the Blueprint.  ENISA will assist the Member States to engage in the  EU Cybersecurity Crisis Response Framework with  National Cybersecurity Crisis Response Frameworks.  Furthermore, upon request or emerging needs,  ENISA will organise workshops and/or table-top  exercises to validate that these procedures facilitate  information exchange without undue delay, prior  to their use – either in real life or in larger exercises  such as Cyber Europe.  Objective 4.2. Community building and  operational cooperation  Output O.4.2.1 – EU CSIRTs Network support  ENISA will continue to support the European  Commission and Member States in the implementation  of the NIS Directive, in particular, in the area of CSIRTs.  As part of this activity, ENISA will continue its tasks  as the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively  support its functionality by suggestions to improve  cooperation and trust building between CSIRTs.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 51  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  Special emphasis will be given to reinforce the  CNW infrastructure and priority will be given to the  operational tasks such as supporting the alert or full  cooperation mode of the CNW during large cross- border incident or crisis (e.g. Covid-19 cyber).The CNW  secretariat will provide support with MS situational  reports synthesis and production of the executive  summary for reporting to the Cooperation Group  as defined in the CNW SOPs. The CSIRTs Network  infrastructure and tools (including its alignment with  MeliCERTes instances) will also be improved.  The Agency will also support this cooperation, upon  request by the members of the CSIRTs Network, by  developing best practices and providing guidance in  the area of operational community efforts such as on  information exchange and secure communication. In  particular, the Agency will be proactive in stimulating  discussions within the network and  providing content  to support discussions on policy and technical  initiatives according to the CSIRTs Network’s own  work programme.  Trust and mutual respect is an important asset for  CSIRT operations. Therefore, ENISA will continue to  improve the level of trust in the network by offering  trust building exercises and events in coordination  with the CSIRTs Network governance. ENISA will take  an active role in facilitating consensus between all  Member States who participate in the CSIRTs Network  in accordance with the NIS Directive.  The Agency will further provide, improve, develop and  secure the CSIRTs Network infrastructure and tools  including its alignment with MeliCERTes instances for  CSIRTs Network member’s smooth collaboration and  administration use (e.g. CSIRTs Network portal and  other communication means).  Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA  and other operational communities  In 2020, ENISA will continue collaborating directly or  indirectly with key stakeholders such as EUROPOL/ EC3, and possibly other affected agencies (e.g. CEPOL,  Eurojust) to support the cooperation between the  CSIRT and the law enforcement communities and the  extensions that this collaboration may have to other  affected communities of stakeholders. ENISA is likely  to continue its analysis and the production of training  materials based on such analyses to lower the  barriers for cooperation across these communities.  In addition, the Agency will continue collaborating  with other operational EU bodies to ensure a  structured cooperation with CERT-EU, European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3), EDA and other relevant EU  bodies in line with the provisions of the Cybersecurity  Act. The goal of the cooperation can be to reach  joint policy outcomes to sustain the fight against  cyber-crime; as such an interactive discussion format  to identify root causes for limitations regarding  cooperation can be considered, alongside trainings  and joint workshops.  Output O.4.2.3 – Supporting the operations of  MeliCERTes platform  ENISA is committed to keep supporting the  MeliCERTes platform, which is envisaged as the  primary collaboration platform between participating  Member States’ CSIRTs and which is helping to  enlarge the EU MS’ preparedness, cooperation and  coordination to effectively respond to emerging cyber  threats and to cross-border incidents.  Any particular CSIRT needs to maintain its data within  the MeliCERTes framework. Some of the data must  be vetted by the centralized workflow – such as the  mandate or memberships in CSIRT communities –to  correctly reflect any changes in the related Central  Trust Circles CTCs.  In 2020, ENISA will fully support the platform from an  operational perspective. In particular, ENISA will run  a dedicated project for tools integration that would  benefit CSIRTs using MeliCERTes. In close cooperation  with the CSIRTs Network, ENISA will synchronize  its efforts with the contractor of MeliCERTes II.  Introducing changes to operational tools during  crisis  or large scale incidents is not possible, because it can  disrupt business continuity of CSIRTs Network SOPs.  Therefore changes to tools can be done only during  the default operation mode of the CNW.  The Agency  will continue  collaborating with  other operational  EU bodies to ensure  a structured  cooperation in line  with the provisions of  the Cybersecurity Act.  52  Summary of the outputs and performance indicators in Activity 4 – Community  Outputs Type of output (P=publication, E=Event,  S=Support)  Performance indicator  Objective 4.1.

Summary of outputs and performance indicators in Activity 4 Community  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 53  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  ACTIVITY 5 – CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION. DEVELOPING SECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES FOR DIGITAL  PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND PROCESSES  Objective 5.1. Support activities related  to cybersecurity certification  Taking into account the legislative and policy  developments in the area of EU Cybersecurity  Certification and acting within the boundaries of its  competence, ENISA will continue working to meet  the requirements for the certification framework for  ICT security products and services by for instance  promoting mutual recognition or harmonisation of  certification practices up to a certain level, in line with  the Cybersecurity Act. Any planned activity in the  area of cybersecurity certification will respect existing  national efforts and interests as well as subsidiarity as  it applies in the area of certification.  Building on the work in 2019, ENISA will provide  support to the European Commission and the  Member States in the policy area of EU cybersecurity  certification framework within the scope of the  Cybersecurity Act. ENISA will stimulate the interaction  and involvement of stakeholders of the Member  States, public policy and the industry in the emerging  EU certification framework.  According to its new role defined by the Cybersecurity  Act, ENISA will support the European Commission by  joining the process of drafting a work programme  for certification. By interacting with the European  Commission, ENISA could assist in gathering  requirements from the private sector and institutional  stakeholders to facilitate the Eorupean Commission  efforts based on an annual plan.  ENISA will provide support for the organisation  of the EU cybersecurity certification framework  (organisational and IT systems and support) and  analysis of functional equivalence of existing  certification schemes across the EU (at the MS as well  as the EU level) with the emerging EU certification  framework to facilitate the transition to the new EU  framework. ENISA will continue to interact with key  stakeholders associated with the EU cybersecurity  certification framework.  Output 5.1.1 – Support the European  Cybersecurity Certification Group, potential  subgroups thereof and the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group  Supporting the European Commission in its role as  chair of the European Cybersecurity Certification  Group, ENISA also helps with the organisation of  the European Cybersecurity Certification Group  and potential subgroups by providing services (to  be determined with the European Commission) like  support for the secretariat, organisational aspects  etc. ENISA will also carry out its tasks as co-chair with  the Commission of the Stakeholder Cybersecurity  Certification Group, and provide secretariat services.  Output 5.1.2 – Research and analysis of the  market as an enabler for certification  By means of analysis and drafting reports, ENISA  will seek to maintain a high level of understanding  of the main drivers for cybersecurity certification in  the EU. The implementation of SOG-IS as a scheme  into the EU cybersecurity certification framework is  a priority task for ENISA. Other areas of interest will  gradually follow when developing the Union Rolling  Work Programme and via requests addressed to the  Agency. The aim of ENISA is to support public policy in  EU cybersecurity certification to protect citizen rights  (e.g. consumer rights, personal data, privacy etc.)  and public interests (e.g. public purchasing in the MS  by means of public procurement). Additionally, 5G  will require particular attention to achieve the policy  objectives. Provided there is a suitable prioritisation  on the Union Rolling Work Programme for  cybersecurity certification, ENISA will shift requests  and Union Rolling Work Programme priorities to  the scheme promulgation process. Additionally, a  market analysis on the EU cybersecurity certification  framework’s impact on manufacturers and service  providers is another area of interest .  Output 5.1.3 – Set-up and maintenance of a  certification portal and associated services  There are technical and organisational tasks  associated with setting up and maintaining a portal.  An IT platform in support of the EU cybersecurity  certification framework goes beyond the scope of  a portal as it must accommodate the needs of all  stakeholders involved (document management,  user management, consultations) and enable  the presentation of dependable information on  certification schemes as required by the regulation.  54  Objective 5.2. Developing candidate  cybersecurity certification schemes  Output 5.2.1 – Hands on tasks in the area of  cybersecurity certification of products, services  and processes  Based on the PDCA (plan-do check-act, and  repeat) approach, ENISA will strive to provide a  comprehensive set of services that include planning,  data collection, consultations, drafting and reviewing.  ENISA will have developed a general methodology  to prepare candidate cybersecurity certification  schemes. ENISA will support by planning and  prioritising and it will provide lists of stakeholders to  give input and offer consultations. ENISA will develop  a feedback mechanism for affected stakeholders e.g.  standardisation organisations. ENISA will continue  to hold its EU Cybersecurity Certification Conference  once or twice a year.  Output 5.2.2 – Tasks related to specific candidate  schemes and ad hoc working groups  In accordance with the Rolling Work Programme  or on request in accordance with the Cybersecurity  Act, ENISA will develop candidate cybersecurity  certification schemes based on the work from 2019  and its own knowledge as well as the input received  from stakeholders. ENISA will support the lifecycle  of the dedicated ad hoc working groups. ENISA  will also follow up with its candidate schemes until  they have been submitted to and accepted by the  European Commission for formal consideration and  eventual approval.

Work programme for the year 2020  ACTIVITY 6 – ENABLING. REINFORCE  ENISA’S IMPACT  Objective 6.1. Management and  compliance  Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall  management of the Agency.  In 2020, the Management Board (MB) Secretariat  will continue to support the Management Board and  the Executive Board in their functions by providing  secretariat assistance. It includes, but is not limited  to the support for meetings and correspondence  that takes place between meetings, the management  of annual declarations of interest and of the  commitment and other requirements.  In relation to the MB, two ordinary meetings will be  organised in 2020 and informal meetings will be held  when necessary. The MB Portal will be supported for  the MB. Regarding the Executive Board, one formal  meeting will be organised per quarter and informal  meetings will be held when necessary.  The Resources Department (RD) oversees a variety  of programs, projects and services related to the  overall management of the Agency, supporting  the Executive Director decisions in areas such  as personnel, finance, procurement, purchasing,  technology, facility management, health, safety,  security, protocol, liaison with local authorities,  MeliCERTes infrastructure, etc.  The aim of the RD is to support the Agency with the  best possible level of efficiency and the best use of  the resources made available to the Agency. This also  includes coordination with the European Commission  Internal Audit Service, European Court of Auditors,  European Ombudsman, European Commission,  European Anti-Fraud Office, EU DG HR, EU DG  BUDG, DG CNECT, etc. All internal policies related to  transparency, anti-fraud policy, protection of whistle- blowers, declarations of interests, prevention of  harassment, etc. are addressed within this activity.  RD strives to maintain and enhance the Agency’s  efficiency and effectiveness of the  and to  continuously contribute to ENISA’s strategy both  internally and externally by seeking optimal solutions  for fulfilling ENISA’s mandate and providing the  necessary assurance of compliance.  The aim is to enable the Agency to minimize  the resources needed with adequate and  modern procedures and tools to maximise the  intended outcome of the work programme and  statutory commitments.  The Core Operations Department (COD)  coordinates the delivery of the Agency’s core  activities. As such, the main role of the COD is to take  on activities A1-A5 of this work programme. The COD  also includes the Policy Unit and the Public Affairs  Team. COD also supports the Advisory group.  Policy Unit  The Policy Unit reports into the Head of Core  Operations. Through the Policy unit, the Agency  initiates and develops strategic cooperations with  active relevant stakeholders from the cybersecurity  community. For instance, the Agency engages  in policy and strategy discussions with political  decision makers (by participating or organizing e.g.  EU MEP activities).  Furthermore, the Agency engages and develops  strategic relationships with e.g. specific industry  sectors at decision making level, and identifies the  strategic issues regarding cybersecurity. The Policy  Unit will also be able to support different institutions  and bodies with regard to policy initiatives related to  cybersecurity. Some of the results of these activities  of the Policy Unit have been published as opinion  papers on ENISA webpage.  Planning the Agency’s activities, including the  Single Programming Document preparation and  coordination of the Work Programme are part of the  Policy Unit’s tasks.  The Policy Unit also includes the Public Affairs Team.  The Public Affairs Team (PAT) reports into the Head  of the Policy Unit and is responsible for coordinating  all communication activities, including media and  press activities such as press releases, news items  and interviews to enhance the reputation, visibility  and the public image of the Agency. It supports the  entire Agency with regard to publications, social  media promotion, website management, public  affairs activities and awareness campaigns. PAT is  also responsible for establishing ENISA's corporate  visual identity.  PAT also plays a major role in supporting events  attended by the Agency, ensuring that ENISA is well  represented from a public affairs perspective.  56  Quality management is part of the Policy Unit. The  Agency implements a Quality Management System  (QMS) to support its regulatory and strategic goals  by means of a quality management approach. The  methodology is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act  (PDCA) cycle, documented in a dedicated SOPs,  and is being applied accordingly. Besides these  activities, more details of the activities delivered by  the Policy Unit and Public Affairs team are listed in  Objective 6.2 – Engagement with stakeholders and  international activities.  Internal control  ENISA aims at implementing the new COSO  framework as well as its new requirements to be  aligned with the European Commission.  The exercise will include the adoption of this framework  by the Management Board as well as the assessment of  the compliance of these Internal Controls.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk  management, governance and internal control  processes of the Agency to provide independent  and objective assurance to the Senior Management,  Executive Director and the Management Board.  IT activities  During 2020 it is expected that the Agency has a  new fully operating datacentre and, in partnership  with other EU Agencies, a Disaster Recovery site at  its disposal,which will enhance the availability of IT  services. It will also help the Agency to be prepared  for any challenges that may arise.  Following up the assessment of information security  risks and IT operational procedures, ENISA will put  in place and update all policies and procedures to  mitigate any identified risks.  For 2020 and following up on the actions of 2019, the  Agency will be heavily investing in strengthening its  capabilities in the areas of information security and  cybersecurity to continue its policy of having the best  security posture possible.  IT supports all internal electronic infrastructures  of the Agency, including, but not limited to core  applications for business use and operation systems.  MeliCERTes. In 2020, ENISA will be running the  central component of MeliCERTes. MeliCERTes will  be the primary collaboration platform for CSIRTs  of participating Member States as well as a means  to improve EU MS preparedness, cooperation and  coordinationto improve cyber threat and cross-border  incident response. The MeliCERTes project will be run  in close cooperation with the EC and MS. The EC will  get a new contract for several areas of the project  for the near future. The long term sustainability  and development of this project will be analysed in  collaboration with all stakeholders involved.  Finance and Procurement  The Agency plans to upgrade its internally developed  electronic tools used for Procurement to simplify  and further automate its tasks related to tendering  and contracting. This is deemed necessary due to the  expected increase of the volume of the work based  on a significantly increased operational budget. It is  anticipated that the further development of the in- house systems should be outsourced. The aim is to  Task Objective Level of  completion 2020  Level of  completion 2021  Level of  completion 2022  Keep ENISA systems safe  from cybersecurity incidents  (from exterior) – detect,  prevent, react and recover  from threats  Security 100% 100% 100%  ENISA IT managed servers  patched in time Security 100% 100% 100%  Exchange server availability Efficiency 98% 98% 98%  Availability of internal  applications  Availability 95% 95% 95%  Help desk, reply with success  to all service requests Efficiency 99% 99% 99%  Summary of Outputs in Activity 6.1 – IT activities  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 57  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  optimise the use of resources, enhance the internal  control of all financial and procurement processes,  to provide better reporting and subsequently a high  level of transparency and efficiency. Internal policies  are in constant evolution to ensure compliance with  the Financial Regulation and Procurement rules. In  line with the internal efficiency increase, the Agency  upskills the internal guidelines and trainings to  guarantee a clear guidance for internal use and to  optimise the available resources.  Budget management identified the need to upgrade  the supporting IT system (ENISA will look for best  practices at other EU agencies).  Human Resources  The ultimate goal of HR is to attract, select, develop  and retain highly qualified staff, to optimise  organisational structures, to promote a safe  working environment (which includes prevention of  harassment), to create a culture that reflects ENISA’s  vision and values in which staff can reach their full  potential and help achieving the organisation’s  objectives.

Additionally, investments and  efforts are focusing on different projects such as the  acquisition of an E-Recruitment tool, the development  and adoption of a missions electronic tool used by  the EC (MIPS) in close collaboration with the European  Commission’s services of SYSPER.  Legal affairs, data protection and information  security coordination  Legal Affairs  Legal Affairs will continue supporting the legal  aspects associated with the operation of the Agency.  This includes dealing with matters such as contracts,  procurement, employment related matters, data  protection and corporate governance matters. Legal  Affairs’ tasks also include dealing with complaints  to the European Ombudsman and representing the  Agency before the European Court of Justice of the  European Union.  Data protection compliance tasks and data  protection office  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer  (DPO) include29:  29 The tasks of the DPO are explicitly mandated in Regulation  (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons  with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union  institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free  movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No  45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/ legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0039.01.

In 2020, the CISO will contribute to  these goals by:  Developing assurance frameworks to  demonstrate ongoing improvements of the  information security management system.  This includes:  –  developing KPIs  Monitoring and reporting the following to the IT  Advisory Committee:  –  KPI results  –  Incidents identified and managed  –  Non-compliances with policy identified and  addressed  Improving the security posture of ENISA by  planning penetration tests and vulnerability  assessments  Advising on security policies and updating existing  ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks  Improving the internal IT security training for  ENISA’s staff  Implementing new systems and tools that support  improvements regarding information security.  Objective 6.2. Engagement with  stakeholders and international activities  Stakeholder communication and dissemination  activities  In 2020, ENISA will continue to focus on key activities  and engage the increasing number of stakeholders.  This includes the different groups of stakeholders  such as  institutions, academia, industry, citizens, etc.  In its engagement with the stakeholders, the Agency  is guided by certain principles such as objectiveness,  openness, transparency and inclusiveness.  Dissemination and outreach  The Agency will continue developing different tools  and channels including the website and with a  strong emphases on social media. Dissemination  activities are the responsibility of the Stakeholders  Communication Team that will define the appropriate  level of outreach activities to make ENISA´s work  available for all interested entities and to provide  added value for Europe.  ENISA´s reputation forquality and trust is of  paramount importance to all stakeholders. It is higly  important that all European citizens  have trust in  ENISA and its work. The cybersecurity challenges  are increasing all over the globe and Europe is no  exception. With this objective ENISA´s reputation  needs to be reinforced continuously. The outreach  tpo promote the Agency’s work is essential to create a  NIS culture across the several actors in Europe. ENISA  is aware of that and will work with eyeryone who  is interested to reach the citizens that want to get  information about the Agency’s work.  Numerous activities that will increase the  cybersecurity awareness across Europe are planned  with different Member Statesto fulfill ENISA´s  mandate, mission and strategy until the end of 2020.

A  strong corporate culture improves staff engagement  and ultimately supports the implementation of the  work programme. It is envisaged to do an annual  review of this strategy to ensure that it is kept up to  date and appropriate for the Agency.  ENISA Advisory Group  In 2020, ENISA will continue to support the ENISA  Advisory Group and the group’s contribution to the  ENISA Work Programme.  The Advisory Group is composed of recognised experts  representing the relevant stakeholders such as the  ICT industry, providers of publicly available electronic  communications networks or services, SMEs, essential  service operators , consumer groups, academic experts  in the field of cybersecurity, and representatives of  competent authorities in accordance with Directive  (EU) 2018/1972 of European standardisation  organisations, as well as of law enforcement and data  protection supervisory authorities.  The Advisory Group is a statutory body of ENISA  pursuant to Article 21 of the Cybersecurity Act  (Regulation (EU) No 2019/881). The Management Board,  acting on a proposal by the Executive Director, sets up  the ENISA Advisory Group for a tenure of 2.5 years.  The role of the Advisory Group is to advise ENISA  regarding ENISA’s performance, excluding Title  III of the Cybersecurity Act which concerns the  Cybersecurity Certification Framework. It shall advise  the Executive Director on the creation of a proposal  for ENISA’s annual work programme and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders on all  related issues. During Q2 2020 a new Advisory Group  will take office.  National Liaison Officer Network  In 2017, ENISA has kicked off various activities  aiming at strengthening the cooperation with its  National Liaison Officers’ (NLO) Network. These  activities were continued and expanded in 2018  and 2019. Based on the Cybersecurity Act, the NLOs  are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and they  warrant the interaction with select public sector  entities in the MS while providing assurance in  terms of outreach, effective liaison with the MS and  dissemination of ENISA’s deliverables.  A strong corporate  culture improves  staff engagement and  ultimately supports  the implementation of  the work programme  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 61  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  ENISA will build on these activities with the NLO  Network as an additional first point of contact for  ENISA in the MS beyond the Management Board,  with emphasis on:  NLO meetings to discuss possible improvements  in the collaboration with ENISA and input on  selected ENISA projects. Improvements aim at  leveraging the NLO network for the dissemination  of ENISA’s work to the EU Member States and  EFTA countries.  The members of the NLO network will continue  to receive information on ENISA’s deliverables,  upcoming ENISA project related tenders,  news, working groups entailing requests for  identification of experts in the MS, vacancy  notices, and events organised or supported (for  example as co-organiser, etc.) by ENISA  as well as  time-sensitive information.  The Agency will maintain and share information  on all relevant ENISA projects and activities  (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant  tender results, etc.) with the NLO network while  maintaining and expanding available online  resources when appropriate.  Additionally, guidelines provided by the Management  Board on missions, objectives and functioning of  the NLO network will guide the development of this  important tool for ENISA for community building.  International relations  Under the executive director’s guidance and  initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level in line with the relevant provisions  of the new Cybersecurity Act.  62  List of outputs in the Work Programme 2020  Activity 1 – Expertise.

Overview of the past and current  situation  The WP 2020 is following the COM guidelines  and MB’s decisions. It is structured following the  objectives and the priorities of the Agency, using  a structure build on the previous years, where a  new activity was added to address the work to be  continued in the area of cybersecurity certification.  ENISA’s budget comparing the years 2018 and 2019 is  increasing due to the new mandate of the Agency and  the scope of its new tasks.  As already presented, for the preparation of Work  Programme 2020, ENISA is using the resources  proposed in the Annexes of the European  Commission’s proposal for ENISA’s new mandate  COM(2017) 477 final. The past and current human  and financial resources are presented in the Annexes  of this document.  Resource programming for the years  2020–2022  The distribution of budget and resources for 2020 for  the activities A1 to A6 is presented in the chart.

The European Commission levels up the  overhead (administration support and coordination)  up to 25%. The table below reflects the situation  at ENISA:  Type 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020  Total Administrative Support and Coordination 19.04% 19.27% 22.89% 18.37% 17.54%  Administrative Support 15.47% 15.66% 19.28% 15.30% 14.91%  Coordination 3.57% 3.61% 3.61% 3.07% 2.63%  Total Operational 66.66% 66.27% 62.65% 69.39% 69.30%  Top Operational Coordination 7.14% 7.23% 7.23% 5.10% 4.39%  General Operational 59.52% 59.04% 55.42% 64.29% 64.91%  Total Neutral 14.29% 14.46% 14.46% 12.24% 13.16%  Finance and Control 14.29% 14.46% 14.46% 12.24% 13.16%  Following the publication of the NIS Directive (NISD),  the Agency is re-allocating budget and resources to  the new tasks/activities provisioned for the Agency in  the Directive. Another area which will probably require  more budget/resources is the Cybersecurity Public  Private Partnership (cPPP). Furthermore, a significant  part of the new resources and budget are foreseen,  according to the draft Cybersecurity Act, to be allocated  to the new Activity 5 on cybersecurity certification.  For the interval of 2020-2022 an increase of budget  and resources allocated to the new activity on  cybersecurity certification and to operational activities  described in the draft Cybersecurity Act is foreseen.  The budget and resources allocations for 2020-2022  within the summary tables and Annexes are in line  with the European Commission’s proposal for ENISA’s  new mandate COM(2017) 477 final.  Overview of activities budget and  resources  The budget and posts  distribution is based on the  Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) methodology of  the Agency, which is in line with the Activity Based  Management (ABM) principle. ABB focuses on  integrated budgeting and financial management  based on activities linked to the Agency’s priorities  and objectives.  To improve estimation of necessary resources for  each ENISA activity, the Agency needs to split the  budget forecast into direct and indirect budget.  The following assumptions are used based on the  simplified ABB methodology:  Direct budget is the cost estimate of each  Operational activity (listed in Activities A1 to A6)  in terms of goods and services procured.  Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries,  mission costs and overhead costs, attributable to  each Operational or Compliance activity. The  indirect budget is re-distributed against direct  budget in all activities.  Compliance posts  from Activity A6 (Enabling) are  re-distributed to core activities – A1 to A5, and  operational posts  of the Activity A6.  Total ABB posts  (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts  from all activities (A1 to A6) after the re-distribution.  The table in the next page presents the allocation  of financial and human resources to activities of the  Agency based on the above ABB methodology.

CALCULATION  OF BUDGET OUTTURN IN EURO  Cancellation of appropriations  Cancellation of Commitment Appropriations  In 2018, Commitment Appropriations were  cancelled for an amount of EUR 1,751.66  representing 0.02 % of the total budget. ENISA  demonstrates a commitment rate of 99.98 %  of C1 appropriations of the year at the end  of the year (31/12). The consumption of the  2018 budget at the end of the year shows  the capacity of the Agency to fully implement  its annual appropriations. The same level  commitment rate is maintained for nine years  in a row. The payment rate reached 88.56 %  and the amount carried forward to 2019 is EUR  1,232,263.40 representing 11.42 % of the total C1  appropriations 2018.  Cancellation of Payment Appropriations  No payment appropriations were cancelled.  Cancellation of Payment Appropriations  Carried over (Fund source “C8” – appropriations  carried over automatically from 2017 to 2018.)  The appropriations of 2017 carried over to 2018  were utilised at a rate of 92.33 % (automatic carry- overs) which indicates a satisfactory capability  of estimation of needs. From the amount of  EUR 1,411,440.51 carried over, the amount of EUR  108,302.57 was cancelled, due to the fact that the  estimated expenditure deviated from the amount  actually paid. This cancellation represents 1 % of  the total budget.  72  Staff  population  A ut  ho ri  se d  un de  r  EU  bu  dg et  2 01  7  A ct  ua lly  fi lle  d  as  of  3 1.  1 2.  2 01  7  A ut  ho ri  se d  un de  r  EU  b ud  ge t  fo r  ye ar  2 01  8  A ct  ua lly  fi lle  d  as  of  3 1.  1 2.  2 01  8  In  b  ud ge  t  fo  r  ye ar  2 01  9  En vi  sa ge  d  in  20  20  En vi  sa ge  d  in  20  21  En vi  sa ge  d  in  20  22  Offi- cials  AD  AST  AST/SC  TA  AD 34 29 34 32 43 51 57 60  AST 14 13 13 12 16 18 19 19  AST/SC  Total 48 42 47 43 59 69 76 79  CA GFIV 28 17 28 16 28 28 28 28  CA GF III 2 11 5 10 2 2 2 2  CA GF II 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  CA GFI 1 0 1 0 0 0 0  Total CA 30 29 33 27 30 30 30* 30  SNE 6 3 3 3 9 12 12 12  Structural ser- vice providers  TOTAL 84 74 83 73 98 111 118 121  External staff  for occasional  replacement  5 5 5 5  Table 1. Staff population and its evolution; overview of all categories of staff  ANNEX 3 HUMAN RESOURCES —  QUANTITATIVE  * While the Agency acknowledges the decrease of CAs (minus 3) and increase of SNEs for 2020-2022, ENISA promotes a more flexible  approach in the use of CAs as agreed by the EU Agencies Network, notably because the use of CAs shall be used as FTE and not  headcounts in accordance with the wording of Article 33(2) of the Financial Regulations referring to estimate of number of contract staff  expressed in full-time equivalent. The management of CAs is by nature a budget related notion being key for the Agency as a flexible  resource allowing the adaptation to business needs focusing on results to achieve and Work programme.  73  Catego- ry and  grade  Estab- lishment  plan  in EU  Budget  2018  Filled as  of 31. 12.  2018  Modifica- tions in  year 2018  in appli- cation of  flexibility  rule  Estab- lishment  plan in  voted EU  Budget  2019  Modifi- cations  in year  2019 in  applica- tion of  flexibility  rule  Estab- lishment  plan 2020  Estab- lishment  plan 2021  Estab- lishment  plan 2022  OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA  AD 16  AD 15  1  1  1  1  1  AD 14  1  AD 13  1 2  AD 12  3  3  6  6  5 4  AD 11  2  2  AD 10  5  3  5  5  3 4  AD 9 10  4  12  12  12 11  AD 8 15  8  19  21 22 22  AD 7  3  3 8 8  AD 6  8  3  3 6  AD 5  1  Total AD 34 31 43 51 57 60  AST 11  AST 10  AST 9  AST 8  1 2  AST 7 2  1  3  4  4 3  AST 6  5  2  7  8  8 8  AST 5  5  2  5  5  5 5  AST 4  1  4  1  1 1 1  AST 3  3  AST 2  AST 1  Total AST 13 12 16 18 19 19  AST/SC1  AST/SC2  AST/SC3  AST/SC4  AST/SC5  AST/SC6  Total  AST/SC  TOTAL 47 43 59 69 76 79  Table 2. Multi-annual staff policy plan year 2020 – 2022 (including staffing evolution  proposal to offer career path possibilities to staff)  74  A. RECRUITMENT POLICY  Statutory Staff  The Agency continues to enhance the management of  the selection procedures focusing on improving time  to hire, developing best practices in recruitment and  streamlining processes. The acquisition of a modern  e-recruitment tool from another EU Agency would  definitively help.  The Agency is also investing in the development of an  strategic approach for HR focusing on competency- based interview’s questions, tailor-made trainings for  Board Member selection, alignment of competencies  across the organisation per job profile, targeted  recruitment procedures for specialised profiles,  transversal recruitment procedures where reserve  lists could be used to fill vacant positions across all  departments/units, specific dissemination of job  vacancies at ENISA, etc.  The job family and job category framework is being  consolidated in line with the Annex I of the SR:  Assistant job family:  Assistant job category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities such as  assistance and/or secretariat requiring a certain  degree of autonomy): typically, these posts are  filled by grades SC1-SC2, AST1-AST3, FGI, FGII  Technical Assistant job category (staff providing  support with a medium degree of autonomy in  the drafting of documents and assistance in the  implementation of policies/projects/procedures/ processes): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AST4-AST7, FG III  Senior Assistant job category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities requiring high  degree of autonomy and carrying out significant  responsibilities in terms of staff management,  budget implementation or coordination):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AST7- AST11 and only for the two Assistants to Head of  Departments by FG IV  Operational job family:  Junior Officer/Administrator job category (staff  providing junior expertise in a specific field of  knowledge): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AD5, FG IV 13  Officer/Administrator job category (staff providing  officer expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD6-AD7,  FG IV 14-18  Lead Officer/Administrator (staff providing top  level expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD8-AD9  Team Leader job category (staff providing  operational excellence with some managerial  responsibilities): typically, these posts are filed by  grades AD7-AD10, FG IV 14-18  Special Advisor job category (staff providing direct  assistance in a specific field of knowledge): typically,  these posts are filled by grades AD9-AD12.  Managerial job family:  Middle Manager job category (staff providing  operational vision and managerial expertise  including financial management): typically, these  posts are Head of Unit positions filled by grades  AD9-AD12  Senior Manager job category (staff providing  strategical vision and managerial expertise  including financial expertise): typically, these posts  are Head of Department positions filled by grades  AD11-AD13  Executive Director (filled by grades AD14-15).  Following the 2014 SR reform, ENISA adopted and  is applying the new implementing rules on the  engagement and use of Temporary Staff for Agencies  (TA 2f), thus ensuring a more consistent staff policy  and allowing inter-mobility between EU agencies.  The established type of posts are in line with Annex I  and Article 80 of the Staff Regulations of Officials and  the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of  the European Union, while the recruitment grades  are in line with Article 3 of the MB Decision/12 of the  ENISA on the general implementation provisions on  ANNEX 4 HUMAN RESOURCES –  QUALITATIVE  75  the procedure governing the engagement and use of  temporary staff under Article 2(f) of the CEOS and EC  Decision C(2011) 1264.  ENISA evaluates the available options with all due  care to not recruit at excessive grade levels and in  line with the Establishment Plan. Nevertheless, in  some cases, the recruitment of experts set above  the entry grade was used as the only solution to  attract the right profile(s) and to ensure nationality  balance (e.g.: TA/AD12 Lead expert for certification).  In the same logic, the use of the AST/SC grade for  secretarial positions, while being in place since the  2014 Staff Regulations Reform, would negatively  impact the attraction and retention of qualified and  geographically diverse staff.  Concerning the duration of employment, the  typical duration was a long-term contract of three  years, renewable for another limited period of  five years with a second renewal for an indefinite  period. While it remains the case for Contract  Agents (3+5+indefinite), the duration for contracts  of Temporary Agents was amended30 to improve  the attractiveness and retention. Hence, the typical  duration for newly recruited Temporary Agents  is an initial 5-year contract with the possibility to  be renewed for an indefinite period. However, all  contract renewals are subject to an assessment of  the performance of the staff member, the budget  availability and the business needs for the function  occupied as stipulated in the ED Decision 38/2017 of 6  June 2017 concerning employment contract renewal.  In the past, ENISA used short-term contract agents  (two years, renewable once for a maximum one year)  but came to the conclusion that this type of contract  does not meet the long-term needs of the Agency  in delivering the objectives. It does not mean that  depending on the business needs and the volatility of  the workforce market, the Agency won’t make use of  this possibility again.  Non-Statutory Staff  ENISA welcomes Seconded National Experts (SNEs) as  an opportunity to foster the exchange of experiences  and knowledge of the Agency’s working methods  and to widen the expert network. Experts can be  seconded to ENISA for the duration of a minimum  six months to a maximum of four years. ENISA offers  paid traineeship opportunities to talented, highly  qualified young professionals at the start of their  careers in a field of their choice. Trainees have the  opportunity to immerse themselves in the Agency's  work and in the European system in general. The  30 ED Decision 16/2019 of 20 February 2019  traineeship may last from a minimum of six months  to a maximum of twelve months.  Finally, in compliance with both the EU legal  framework and the Greek labour legislation, ENISA’s  policy is intended to rely on interim services under  specific circumstances and for limited period of time.  The Agency holds a framework contract that has been  awarded to a temping Agency.  B. APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE AND  RECLASSIFICATION/PROMOTIONS  ENISA has adopted the implementing rules MB  2016/10 on Reclassification of CA’s, MB 2016/11 on  Reclassification of TA’s. ENISA is applying a qualitative  performance management based on the European  Commission Model.  For the forthcoming years, the organisation will strive  to see performance management as a business  process that improves employee engagement and  drive business results. It enables staff to focus on  having a constructive dialogue with the manager and  to consider the exercise as a valuable developmental  tool, while clarifying that the appraisal and the  reclassification are two different exercises.  76  Category  and grade  Staff in activity at 01.01.2018 How many staff members  were reclassified in 2019  Average number of years  in grade of reclassified/  promoted staff members officials TA officials TA  AD 16  AD 15 1  AD 14  AD 13  AD 12 3  AD 11  AD 10 3  AD 9 2  AD 8 10 2 2.5  AD 7 3  AD 6 7 2 4.25  AD 5 1  Total AD 30  AST 11  AST 10  AST 9  AST 8  AST 7 1  AST 6 2  AST 5 2  AST 4 6 1 2  AST 3 2 1 5  AST 2  AST 1  Total AST 13  AST/SC1  AST/SC2  AST/SC3  AST/SC4  AST/SC5  AST/SC6  Total AST/SC  Total 43 6  Table 1. Reclassification of temporary staff/promotion of officials  77  ANNEX Human resources — qualitative  Function  group  Grade Staff in activity at  01.01.2018  How many staff members  were reclassified in 2019  Average number of years in grade  of reclassified staff members  CA IV 17  16 1  15 1  14 11  13 3  CA III 11 1  10 2 3 6  9 7 1 5  8 2  CA II  CA I 3 1  Total 29 4  Table 2. Reclassification of contract staff  C. MOBILITY POLICY  All internal moves are processed via Article 7 of the  Staff Regulations and for transparency purposes  are published internally on INTRAENISA. In order to  create a motivated and versatile workforce, ENISA  has adopted an ED Policy 01/2017 of 22 February  2017 on Internal Mobility Policy. ENISA also joined the  inter-agency job market (IAJM), like all other Agencies,  to offer mobility possibilities to the Agency employees  by assuring a continuation of careers and grades.  Additionally, ENISA is also open to mobility between  the agencies and the EU Institutions.  a.  Mobility within agency: since January 2019, 13  staff members where moved under Article 7 of  Staff Regulations.  b.  Mobility among agencies: in 2019, 1 staff member  was recruited under Inter-Agency Mobility Call.  c. Mobility between agency and Institutions: in 2019,  3 former ENISA staff members moved to EU agencies  and 1 former employee moved to an EU Institution.  D. LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT  The Agency is striving for excellence when it comes  to staff development. In order to make the most out  of its internal expertise and to develop mechanisms  to retain staff, the organisation is focusing on  offering a wide range of learning and development  opportunities including mandatory trainings (e.g.  Ethics and Integrity, harassment prevention, etc.),  various workshops and team building events, on-line  courses, access to EU-Learn, etc.  78  Per Gender  Male  52 % Female  48 %  E. GENDER AND GEOGRAPHICAL  BALANCE  The overall gender balance among ENISA staff shows  a slight male prevalence that is understandable given  the scope of the Agency's work. As a measure to  promote equal opportunities, the terms of published  vacancy notices prevent any kind of discrimination  and the Selection Board’s composition is balanced  in terms of gender and nationality as far as possible.  In 2019, the Agency had 2 women HoUs (Head of HR  unit and Head of Finances and Procurement unit) and  6 women coordinating teams.  With regard to the geographical balance, while there  is no quota system in operation, when recruiting,  the Staff Regulations require to strive for a broad  balance among nationalities and to adopt necessary  measures if there is imbalance between nationalities  among staff. ENISA is paying great attention to this  requirement. However, ENISA is facing the same  challenges (as reported by the European Commission  for the European Civil Service and as with some  other EU Agencies with low coefficient correcteur) in  attracting and retaining some nationalities. This is  mainly due to the specific labour market where ENISA  operates and high salaries in the private sector which  ENISA is cannot compete with due to low corrector  coefficient. Hence, ENISA is facing challenges in  increasing it visibility on the market as an employer  of choice. Moreover, ENISA is not offering an  accredited European School in Athens and, at the  same time, partners of the staff members lack the  possibility to find a job, which makes the situation  even more difficult for ENISA to attract staff from  some specific nationalities. ENISA is committed to  ensure a diverse workforce representation, however  strives to retain staff from some nationailities on the  abovementioned consideration.  The graphics reflect the situation as for 31.12.2018.

A new seat agreement between ENISA and the  Hellenic Authorities entered into force on the  04/10/2019. As per the new seat agreement signed  by ENISA and the Hellenic Authorities, the Agency will  continue having premises in Athens and Heraklion  as it had under the previous agreement. However,  the permanent seat of the Agency is now in Athens  having the majority of its staff there. The premises  of ENISA in Athens are privately owned and rented  by the Agency, while the premises in Heraklion are  located in a public building made available by the  Hellenic Authorities. The payment of rents for the  premises in Athens and Heraklion are covered by the  Hellenic Authorities who provide up to 640 000 euro  per year.  The current building in Athens will not suffice to  accommodate all the new staff that will be joining  the Agency in virtue of the new Mandate with  the additional challenge that the current renting  contract expires on 31/12/2021 with no possibility  for extension. ENISA is in constant contact with the  Hellenic Authorities to find suitable premises to  accommodate all staff in the near future.  ANNEX 5 BUILDINGS  ANNEX 6 PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES  Agency privileges Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities /  diplomatic status  Education / day care  In accordance with Art. 23 of  Regulation (EU) No 2019/881  of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April  2019, the protocol No 7 on  the privileges and immunities  of the European Union  annexed to the TEU and the  TFEU applies to the Agency  and its staff.  In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No  2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 17 April 2019, the protocol No 7 on the  privileges and immunities of the European Union  annexed to the TEU and the TFEU applies to the  Agency and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed a seat  agreement on 13 November 2018, which was ratified  by Greek Law 4627/2019 on 25 September 2019 and is  applicable to ENISA and its staff.  A public School of  European Education, Type  2, was founded in 2005 by  the Greek government in  Heraklion, Crete, for the  children of ENISA’s staff. There is no European  School operating in Athens.  81  ENISA uses an internal monitoring system (MATRIX)  that is also used for project management. ENISA’s  management team regularly uses this information,  which is also used for monthly reporting. Moreover,  ENISA has implemented a mid-term review procedure  and monthly management team meetings.  External consultants are contracted to carry annual  ex-post evaluation of operational activities. The scope  of the evaluation focusses on ENISA’s operational  activities. The overall aim of the annual evaluations is  to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, added value,  utility, coordination and coherence.  ANNEX 7 EVALUATIONS  The Self Risk Assessment was performed by the  Internal Audit Service in 2016. Three areas were  proposed for the three next years: Stakeholder  involvement in the production of ENISA’s deliverables  (done in 2017), Human Resources (2018), Information  and Communication Technology (2019).

The ENISA organisation valid as of 01.11.2019 with  active staff is as follows:  Management  Board  Executive  Board  RD  Resource  Department  Advisory  Group  COD  Core Operations  Department  CS  Corporate  Services  FAP  Finance and  Procurement  HSA  Horizontal  Support and  Analysis Team  COD 1 Secure  Infrastructure  and Services  COD 2  Data Security &  Standardisation  COD 3  Operational  Security  PO  Policy Unit  HR  Human  Resources  CR  CSIRT  Relations  Team  Executive  Director  AD 3 AST 0 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 1 AST 1 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 2 AST 0 CA 1  SNE 0  AD 2 AST 2 CA 5  SNE 0  AD 6 AST 1 CA 5  SNE 1 AD 1 AST 3 CA 1  SNE 0  AD 2 AST 0 CA 0  SNE 0 AD 6 AST 1 CA 2  SNE 0 AD 1 AST 0 CA 4  SNE 0  AD 4 AST 0 CA 1  SNE 0 AD 3 AST 1 CA 3  SNE 1  AD 1 AST 4 CA 4  SNE 0  84  ANNEX 11 SUMMARISING THE KEY  INDICATORS FOR THE  MULTIANNUAL ACTIVITIES  In line with the prescribed European Commission  approach, the Agency is in an ongoing process to  improve the standing of its key indicators for the  purpose of improving measuring and reporting  better matching the deliverables of its annual  work programme.  The purpose of the key indicators for ENISA is to  provide the metrics to measure the performance,  results and impact of the Agency’s outcome, output  and impact. Key indicators seek to better depict policy  dynamics on network and information security, an  area of policy that still is under development at EU  level as technology and business models evolve.  The chosen approach initially sets the designated  levels of key indicators; each type of indicator  is grouped alongside other similar ones at the  appropriate level. This approach has been developed  by taking the capability of the Agency to report into  account as well as the need to avoid any unnecessary  burden on the Agency. The Agency’s capability to  report reflects effort, organisational measures and  tools available (or that can be obtained relatively  easily). Measuring operational performance that  concerns the policy raison d'être of the Agency  remains the focal point for the key indicators  introduced. The key notions and main vectors  of annual and multi-annual measurements are  presented hereunder.  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:  Performance that is a concern at the output level  when deliverables are produced. Metrics used are  project management-based and they include:  a.  Adherence to the scope of the deliverable  or project;  Output measured KPIs  for each deliverable  Outcome measured  KRI (Key Results  Indicators) per  Activity  Fitness-for-purpose at  the Agency level: •  E: evaluation report  according to mandate  every 2 years –  external evaluation  (COM, etc.)  Performance  OUTPUT LEVEL  (ex-Deliverables)  Proposed indicators: •  S: scope •  B: budget (*) •  P: people (*) •  T: time (*) •  Q: quality of  performance  (depending on the  output: Publication,  Events, Support)  (*) Up to the designated levels  Results  ANNUAL  ACTIVITIES´ LEVEL (ex-WPK/cluster)  Proposed indicators: •  D: delivery Indicator  (Y/N), i.e. 95% (3  sigma) of projects/  activity delivered in  SBPTQ for year N, with  5% fluctuation margin  •  F: feedback from  stakeholders – Store  and analyse aggregates  in a database  MULTIANNUAL  ACTIVITIES´ LEVEL  Progress of KRI  presented for year N  Proposed indicators: •  95% (3 sigma) of  projects/ activity  delivered in SBPTQ for  year N+1 and N+2, with  5 % fluctuation margin  •  Fa: Feedback  aggregation  Impact  AGENCY LEVEL  Outreach Impact  KII (Key Impact  Indicators)  Multi-annual Annual  85  b.  Budget (or financial resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ±5% margin;  c.  People (or human resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ±5% margin;  d.  Time available to carry out the output or  project remaining within prescribed levels with  a ±5% margin;  e.  Quality of performance depending on the  type of output, according to the classification  of output in the work programme (being,  publication, event, support).  Results that are a concern at the annual and at  multi-annual activities’ level. The indicators used  are as follows:  a.  Delivery indicator aiming at delivering at least  95% matched with the work programme  planning. This is equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma)  organisation (reaching between 93.3% and  99.3%); clearly the Agency has historically  proven its operational ability to deliver at  a much higher level, meeting 6σ (6 Sigma)  specification requirements (at 99.99%).  However, allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  above-mentioned deviation rate of ±5%.31 The  criteria used, i.e. scope, budget, people, time  and quality, all refer to the proper execution of  the project leading up to the production of the  output. This evaluation is done at the end of  the project within ENISA.  b.  Following the production process that leads  up to an output, feedback from stakeholders is  collected on each output. Results are gathered  on a multi-annual basis by the Agency.  31 In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance  between the mean value and the inflexion point. Shortening this  distance is an indicator of enhanced quality of performance.  While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of  the current version of the QMS of the Agency portions thereof,  are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the  reference Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) hereto is the  SOP PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) that is a simplified version of  the DMAIC (define-measure-analyse-improve-control) approach  typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice for simplicity is  obviously desirable while the implementation of a quality system  is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses on process control for  the purpose of reducing or eliminating waste. Six Sigma utilizes  historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and  improve a company’s operational performance e.g. processes,  practices, and support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of  process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard  deviations from the mean.

All rating indicators follow a variable Traffic Light  Rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows:  Green reflects a 5% deviation, which means that  planning/performance is appropriate and within  prescribed levels.  Yellow reflects a 20% deviation, which means that  planning/performance needs to be revisited.  Red reflects a deviation above 20%, which  means that planning/performance needs  a thorough review.  Feedback is collected by using surveys. It is envisaged  that the website’s deliverables section will be  leveraged to gather targeted feedback against each  deliverable. However, this will only be made available  in 2018 the earliest.  Below you can find an example of output related  indicators to be collected regarding the key types of  Agency output, namely, publication, event, support.  87  ANNEX Summarising the key indicators for the multiannual activities  Aggregated outcome at the annual activity level in years n, n+1 and n+2 Multi-annual level  Annual activity x,y,z in year n  Annual activity x,y,z in year n+1  Annual activity x,y,z in year n+2  Multiannual activity  x,y,z evolution  Delivery  related  e.g. output  instantiations 70% Green 20% Yellow 10% Red  e.g. output  instantiations 80% Green 10% Yellow 10% Red  e.g. output  instantiations 90% Green 10% Yellow 0% Red  In each 3 year period  we gather feedback on  a per activity level:  80% Green 13% Yellow 7% Red  Feedback  (external)  e.g. green feedback  Out of 200 responses  45% positive 45% neutral 10% negative  e.g. green feedback  Out of 200 responses  50% positive 40% neutral 10% negative  e.g. green feedback  Out of 200 responses  55% positive 40% neutral 5% negative  In each 3 year period  we gather feedback on  a per activity level:  50% positive 41% neutral 9% negative  Below you can find an example of outcome related indicators to be collected regarding the key types of Agency  activities at the annual and at the multi-annual level.  88  ANNEX 12 LIST OF ACRONYMS ABB: Activity Based Budgeting APF: Annual Privacy Forum BEREC: Body of European Regulators of Electronic  Communications cPPP: Cyber Security Public-Private Partnership  CE2020: Cyber Europe 2020 CEF: Connecting Europe Facility CEP: Cyber Exercises Platform CERT-EU: Computer Emergency Response Team for the  EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies  CEN: European Committee for Standardization CENELEC: European Committee for  Electrotechnical Standardization CIIP: Critical Information Infrastructure Protection CSCG: ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security  Coordination Group CSIRT: Computer Security Incidents Response Teams CSSU: Corporate Stakeholders and Services Unit COD: Core Operational Department COM: European Commission CSS: Cyber Security Strategy CNW: CSIRTs Network DG: EC Directorate-General DG CONNECT: Directorate General for Communications  Networks, Content and Technology DPA: Data Protection Authorities DPO: Data Protection Officer DSM: Digital Single Market E: Event, type of output i.e. conference, workshop,  and seminar  EB: ENISA Executive Board EC3: European Cybercrime Centre, Europol ECA: European Court of Auditors  ECSM: European Cyber Security Month ECSO: European Cyber Security Organisation ED: Executive Director EDO: Executive Directors Office  EDPS: European Data Protection Supervisor eID: electronic Identity eIDAS: Regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services for electronic transactions in the internal market ETSI: European Telecommunications Standards Institute EU: European Union FAP: Finance, Accounting and Procurement  FIRST: Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams FM: Facilities Management FTE: Full Time Equivalents  H2020: Horizon 2020 HoD: Head of Department HR: Human Resources  IAS: Internal Audit Service  ICC & IAC: Internal Control Coordination and Internal  Audit Capability  ICS/SCADA: Industrial Control Systems/Supervisory  Control and Data Acquisition ICT: Information and Communication Technologies IS: Information Systems ISP: Internet Service Providers IXP: Internet Exchange Point KII: Key Impact Indicator  KPI: Key Performance Indicator  LEA: Law Enforcement Agency MFF: Multi Annual Financial framework M2M: Machine to Machine MB: Management Board MS: Member State(s) NAPAC: National Public Authority  Representatives Committee NCSS: National Cyber Security Strategies NIS: Network and Information Security NISD: NIS Directive NLO: National Liaison Officer NRA: National Regulatory Authority O: Output OES: Operators of Essential Services  P: Publication, type of output covering papers,  reports, studies  PDCA: Plan-Do-Check-Act PETs: Privacy Enhancing Technologies PPP: Public Private Partnership PSG: Permanent Stakeholders Group Q: Quarter QMS: Quality Management System R&D: Research and Development RD: Resources Department  S: Support activity, type of output  SB: Supervisory Body SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SDO: Standard Developing Organization SME: Small and Medium Enterprise SO: Strategic Objectives SOP: Standard Operating Procedure SRAD: Stakeholder Relations and Administration Department  TF-CSIRT: Task Force of Computer Security Incidents  Response Teams TLR: Traffic Light Rating TRANSITS: Computer Security and Incident Response  Team (CSIRT) personnel trainings TSP: Trust Service Provider US: United States of America WP: Work Programme  89  ANNEX 13 LIST OF POLICY REFERENCES  The Agency situates its work in the wider context of a legal and policy environment as  pointed out below.

Beyond the consequences that this pandemic is  bringing to our everyday lives, the crisis has also affected cyber incidents. ENISA has been called  upon to support Europe during these testing times by making recommendations to the critical  infrastructure industry, supporting the EU Tracing Apps Toolbox, providing cybersecurity advice  to SMEs and guidance to the healthcare sector against the increase of phishing campaigns  and ransomware attacks. ENISA is raising awareness of its cybersecurity recommendations  on a variety of topics including working remotely, shopping online, and e-health; and with  the support of its partner’s issues weekly situation reports of on-going cyber incidents. In  addition, the CSIRTs Network being placed on high alert required increased support by the  Agency. Through protecting our critical infrastructure, public outreach and creating a common  situational awareness, ENISA has thus far played its role in preventing malicious cyber actors  from taking advantage of the health pandemic and turning it into a large scale cyber pandemic.  This document presents the amended Work programme of the Agency for 2020, which takes  account of changes required to respond to Covid-19.  Juhan Lepassaar Executive Director  1  10101  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 11  The mission of ENISA has been to contribute to  securing Europe's information society by raising  awareness of network and information security and  to develop and promote a culture of network and  information security in society for the benefit of  citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector  organizations in the Union.  ENISA was founded in 2004 to contribute to the  overall goal of ensuring a high level of NIS within the  EU by acting as a centre of expertise and supporting  the Member States in capacity building.  In 2019, the mandate1 of the Agency has been  extended and the role of ENISA has been reinforced  within the EU cybersecurity landscape. ENISA  supports the European Institutions, the Member  States and the business community in addressing,  responding to and especially in preventing network  and information security problems. It does so  through a series of activities across six areas:  Expertise: assess and improve  Europe's knowledge in addressing emerging  cybersecurity challenges.  1 Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and  communications technology cybersecurity certification and  repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act), OJ L  151, 7.6.2019, p. 15–69, available at: http://data.europa.eu/eli/ reg/2019/881/oj  Policy: support cybersecurity policy making and  implementation in the Union.  Capacity: support capacity building across the  Union (e.g. through trainings, recommendations  and awareness raising activities).  Cooperation: foster the cooperation within the EU  cybersecurity community (e.g. by supportingfthe  CSIRTs activities and network, coordination of  pan-European cyber exercises).  Certification: support the implementation of the  cybersecurity certification framework for ICT  products, services and processes.  Enabling: reinforcing ENISA’s impact and efficiency  (e.g. through engagement with the stakeholders  and international relations).  The area ‘Certification’ represents a new activity for  ENISA and is an outcome of the Cybersecurity Act.  In line with these objectives and tasks, the Agency  carries out its operations in accordance with  an annual and multiannual work programme,  containing all of its planned activities, drawn up  by the Executive Director of ENISA and adopted by  ENISA’s Management Board (MB).  ENISA’s approach is strongly impact driven, based  on the involvement of all relevant stakeholder  communities, with a strong emphasis on pragmatic  solutions that offer a sensible mix of short-term  and long-term improvements.

I  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 15  THREAT LANDSCAPE  2018 brought significant changes for the cyberthreat  landscape and the forecasting capability of  ENISA. These changes were triggered by discrete  developments in motives and tactics of the most  important threat agent groups, namely cyber- criminals and state-sponsored actors. Monetization  motives have contributed to the appearance of  crypto-miners in the top 15 threats. State-sponsored  activities have led to the assumption that there is  a shift towards reducing the use of complex malicious  software and infrastructures and going towards low  profile social engineering attacks.  Developments have also been made by the  defenders. Through the emergence of active  defence, threat agent profiling has led to a more  efficient identification of attack practices and  malicious artefacts, thus leading to more efficient  defence techniques and attribution rates. Initial  successes have been achieved through the  combination of cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) and  traditional intelligence. This is a clear indication of  the need to open CTI to other related disciplines to  increase the quality of assessments and attribution.  Finally, defenders have increased the levels of  training to compensate skill shortage in the area  of CTI. The high interest of stakeholders in such  trainings is a clear indication for their appetite in  building capabilities and skills.  Recent political activities have underlined the  emergence of various, quite novel developments  in the perceived role of cyberspace for society and  national security. Cyber-diplomacy, cyber defence and  cyber-war regulation have dominated the headlines.  These developments, when transposed to actions,  are expected to bring new requirements and new use  cases for CTI. Equally, through these developments,  currently existing structures and processes in  the area of cyberspace governance will undergo  a considerable revision. These changes will affect  international, European and Member States bodies. It  is expected that threat actors are going to adapt their  activities towards these changes, thus affecting the  cyberthreat landscape in the years to come.  In summary, the main trends in the  2018’s cyberthreat landscape are:  Mail and phishing messages have become the  primary malware infection vector.  Exploit Kits have lost their importance in the  cyberthreat landscape.  Cryptominers have become an important  monetization vector of cyber-criminals.  State-sponsored agents increasingly target banks  by using attack-vectors utilised by cyber-crime.  Skill and capability building are a major focus for  the defenders. Public organisations struggle with  staff retention due to strong competition from the  industry in attracting cybersecurity talents.  PART I GENERAL CONTEXT  16  Technical orientation of cyberthreat intelligence is  an obstacle towards awareness raising at the level  of security and executive management.  Cyberthreat intelligence needs to respond to  increasingly automated attacks through novel  approaches due to utilization of automated tools  and skills.  The emergence of IoT environments will remain  a concern due to missing protection mechanisms  in low-end IoT devices and services. The need for  generic IoT protection architectures/best practices  will remain pressing.  The absence of cyberthreat intelligence solutions  for low-capability organisations/end-users needs  to be addressed by vendors and governments.  All these trends are evaluated and analysed against  the content of the ENISA Threat Landscape Report  2018 (ETL 2018). Open issues based on these  trends will be identified. Additionally, ENISA will  propose measures to be taken in the areas of policy,  business and research/education.  They serve as  recommendations and will be taken into account for  future activities of ENISA and its stakeholders.  Regarding all these developments, ENISA has  identified numerous activities to address current  trends in the cyberthreat landscape and increase  knowledge and capability levels for different  stakeholder groups. The content of the present  programme document aims at activities that will result  in less exposure to the aforementioned cyberthreats.  POLICY INITIATIVES  Since its foundation in 2004, ENISA, has actively  contributed to raising awareness of NIS challenges  in Europe, the development of MS NIS capacities and  the reinforcement of the cooperation of MS and other  NIS stakeholders.  NIS are high on the EU policy agenda, particularly  in the European Cybersecurity Strategy (2013), the  European Cyberdefence Policy Framework (2014) and  in the European Digital Single Market (DSM) (2015).  ENISA will continue to accompany the efforts of the  Member States and EU institutions in reinforcing  NIS across Europe. In particular, the recent adoption  of the European Directive of  the European  Parliament and the Council on measures to ensure  a high common level of network and information  securitycalls for an increased commitment by  ENISA to support a coherent approach towards NIS  across Europe.  With the adoption of the NIS Directive (2016), the  fields of action were extended to accompany the  evolution of NIS in Europe. ENISA plays a key role in  the following activities in particular:  contributing to the NIS technical and operational  cooperation by actively supporting cooperation  between Member States CSIRTs within  the European CSIRTs Network and the NIS  Cooperation Group;  providing input and expertise for collaboration  between competent national authorities at policy  level in the framework of the cooperation group  established by the NIS Directive;  supporting the strengthening of the NIS of EU  institutions in close cooperation with CERT-EU and  the institutions themselves.  In parallel, ENISA will continue to contribute to the  reinforcement of NIS as a driver of the DSM and more  generally of economic growth in Europe, including the  development of NIS and related ICT industries.  The publication of the new EU cybersecurity package  on 13 September 2017 with its set of legislative  and non-legislative measures has identified ENISA  as a key pillar of the EU’s ambition to reinforce  cybersecurity across Europe, which is documented  in the Cybersecurity Act, which provides for the  strengthening  of ENISA.  In addition to strengthening ENISA, the Cybersecurity  Act creates a framework for European Cybersecurity  Certification schemes with to the aim of creating  a digital single market for ICT products, services and  processes. ENISA will play a significant role in the  preparation of the candidate schemes, contributing to  the harmonisation of the EU cybersecurity certification.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 17  PART I. General context  II  This section reflects mid-term priorities that should  guide the activities of the Agency for the next  three years.

ACTIVITY 1 – EXPERTISE. ANTICIPATE AND  SUPPORT EUROPE’S KNOWLEDGE IN FACING  EMERGING CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  Objective 1.1. Improving knowledge on  the security of digital developments  Output O.1.1.1 – Building knowledge on the  security of Internet of Things  The Agency has been working on IoT security for  a number of years, creating, among other things,  baseline IoT security recommendations5 (WP2017),  sectoral work in Industry 4.0/smart manufacturing6  (WP2018), secure development guidelines (WP2019),  5 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline- security-recommendations-for-iot  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good- practices-for-security-of-iot  PART III WORK PROGRAMME  FOR 2020  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-security-recommendations-for-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practices-for-security-of-iot  32  etc. With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security  and privacy, the IoT threat landscape is extremely  complex and wide. Therefore, it is important to  understand what exactly needs to be secured and to  implement specific security measures to protect the  IoT from cyber threats. Moreover, the Agency is in line  with the priorities of the EC for the next 5 years7.  Building on its previous work on IoT security,  the Agency will identify and analyse existing IoT  security practices, national expertise, regulatory  initiatives and standards that aim at protecting the  IoT ecosystem as a whole. The Agency will map the  evolving threat landscape to these practices and  standards to develop guidelines for improving the  IoT security, focusing on its impact on the consumers  and the overall supply chain (for example 3rd party  dependencies, integration of components, etc.) –  particularly in the context of Industry 4.0 and smart  infrastructures.  To meet these goals, the Agency will take existing EU  policy and regulatory initiatives (the NIS Directive,  the Internet of Things - An action plan for Europe,  the Communication on Building strong cybersecurity  for the EU, the Public Private Partnership (PPP) on  cybersecurity, etc.) into account and contribute to  them. ENISA will work with relevant stakeholders  (public and private sector, national cybersecurity  agencies, and EU funded IoT research projects) and  EU initiatives (e.g. AIOTI).  The Agency will consider developing targeted IoT  case studies to identify risks and attack scenarios,  and provide relevant recommendations and good  practices. Accordingly, it will consider defining e.g.  secure IoT procurement guidelines to support  consumers, IoT supply chain security guidelines  or other means to raise awareness and to ensure  “security for safety” .  ENISA will also validate the results of the study (e.g.  via joint workshops) with relevant IoT stakeholders.  Output O.1.1.2 – Building knowledge on Connected  and Automated Mobility (CAM)  The automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm  change towards connected and autonomous  vehicles. Smart cars that are already available  today provide connected features for added value  to enhance the car users’ experience or improve  their safety. With an increased connectivity (that the  emergence of 5G is expected to promote further)  novel cybersecurity risks and threats arise and  7 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/ political-guidelines-next-commission_en.pdf  need to be addressed. In light of the NIS Directive,  in which road authorities and intelligent transport  systems are among the entities identified as  Essential Service Operators in the road transport  sub-sector, there is a growing need for addressing  the security of smart cars.  The Agency will continue its work on smart cars8  (WP2016, WP2019) and monitor security practices  and standards in the area of smart cars (e.g. UN-ECE  dedicated TF on CYBER, ISO/SAE standardisation  work), taking the emerging notions of connectivity  and autonomy into consideration. ENISA will examine  the security challenges arising from the deployment  of connected and autonomous vehicles as well as  issues such as V2V and V2X communications. The  Agency will review these practices and standards and  highlight or suggest good practices and potential  legislative actions required to guarantee security  of smart cars, focusing on general safety as  well  as connectivity and autonomy.  To assist the European commission and the  Member States in achieving these objectives, the  Agency will evaluate and contribute to existing EU  policy and regulatory initiatives (the NIS Directive,  the European strategy on Cooperative Intelligent  Transport Systems9, the C-ITS Platform of DG MOVE10,  the High Level Group GEAR 203011) as well as the  planned European Commission Recommendation  on Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM), the  3rd Mobility package12, the Communication on CAM  and the relevant work of Euro NCAP. ENISA is in line  with the cybersecurity effort of the joint initiative by  DG MOVE, DG CNCT, RTD and DG GROW established  under the 3rd Mobility package.  To ensure an aligned approach across Member  States, the Agency will support their work within  the NIS Cooperation framework regarding the  identification of the operators of essential services  in the transport sector. It will also support with the  establishment of common follow-up processes  regarding cyberattacks against road infrastructures.  Additionally, the Agency will validate the results of  the study (e.g. via joint workshops) in collaboration  with relevant stakeholders in the field of smart  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security- and-resilience-of-smart-cars  9 See http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0766  10 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en  11 See https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level- group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and- sustainability_en  12 See https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2018- 05-17-europe-on-the-move-3_en  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/political-guidelines-next-commission_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/political-guidelines-next-commission_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/3rd-mobility-pack/com20180283_en.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-security-and-resilience-of-smart-cars http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0766 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0766 https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level-group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and-sustainability_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level-group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and-sustainability_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/high-level-group-gear-2030-report-on-automotive-competitiveness-and-sustainability_en https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2018-05-17-europe-on-the-move-3_en https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2018-05-17-europe-on-the-move-3_en  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 33  PART III.

Output O.1.1.3 – Building knowledge on Artificial  Intelligence security  Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies facilitate  intelligent and automated decision-making and are  thus a prerequisite to the deployment of IoT and  Industry 4.0 scenarios, as well as other application  areas. Interesting showcases of AI include smart  manufacturing (robotics), autonomous driving, smart  cities, etc. Even though undoubtedly beneficial, AI  and its application on automated decision making  –especially in safety critical deployments such as  in autonomous vehicles – can offer new ways for  manipulation and other attacks.  When considering security regarding AI, considerate  needs to be considered that AI can be exploited  to manipulate expected outcomes, but also that  AI techniques can be utilised to support security  operations. Accordingly, adversarial techniques  to manipulate AI algorithms are emerging and  therefore pose a relevant risk that needs to be  taken into account. The manipulation of data input  in AI algorithms is also an area of concern for  cybersecurity, since intentional or unintentional  modifications of can significantly affect the behaviour  of the algorithms. Moreover, the evolutionary  nature of AI algorithms and the need to perform  verifications and even forensics in this complex  field exacerbate cybersecurity concerns, especially  in connection with thheir application in critical  information infrastructures. Conversely, AI is  becoming an important tool for cybersecurity itself,  as it can be used to identify attack patterns and thus  facilitates supervision of security management/policy  implementation and allows forautomated incident  management etc.  The Agency will conduct a study on the challenges  related to AI security taking relevant issues, risks  and solutions into consideration. In doing so, ENISA  will map relevant stakeholders and experts, engage  with the wider community and validate the results  of the study (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant  national and EU initiatives and competent authorities.  Moreover, the Agency will interact with AI stakeholders  from the public sector such as the relevant European  Commission services, etc. ENISA will take stock of  existing initiatives and studies that are ongoing in  the area of AI cybersecurity such as the results of  EU projects in this area (H2020) to avoid duplication  of the efforts, but instead focus on providing  a harmonized view of the ongoing works. ENISA will  also support the EC in upcoming and ongoing policy  initiatives related to the topic such as the coordinated  European approach on artificial intelligence.  Output O.1.1.4 – Building knowledge on the  security of healthcare services  Recent cybersecurity incidents have shown  that healthcare is one of the most vulnerable  sectors. Previous ENISA studies highlighted that  the healthcare sector has a relatively low level of  maturity regarding cybersecurity. Newly adopted  EU legislations have indicated that there has  been a shift in priorities: the NIS Directive defines  healthcare organisations as operators of essential  services, the Medical Devices Regulation13 (MDR)  includes obligatory safety and security provisions  for medical devices and the EC Communication on  enabling digital transformation of healthcare in  the digital single market14 as described in the 2018  communication of the European Commission on data  package15. The Agency supports the actions taken by  the EC to increase health information data sharing  with a strong focus on cybersecurity.  The Agency, based on previous experience, will  support Healthcare organisations in enhancing their  cyber security level by helping them assessing risk  in the healthcare information systems. This work  will enable Healthcare organisations to identify  vulnerabilities and evaluate risks for all assets in  the healthcare ecosystem. The agency will consider  assessing implementation scenarios , e.g. ePrescription  systems, remote patient healthcare, proactive/  13 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/ regulatory-framework_en  14 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care- digital-single-market-empowering  15 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-3364_en.htm  ENISA will take stock  of existing initiatives  and studies that are  ongoing in the area of  AI cybersecurity  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-enabling-digital-transformation-health-and-care-digital-single-market-empowering http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-3364_en.htm  34  predictive approaches to healthcare, mHealth, Cloud  and big data for healthcare services (list is indicative).  The goal is to provide a collection of common practices  for ensuring cybersecurity in interoperable hospital  systems and related care environments.  The emerging situation from the COVID-19 pandemic  affecting the sector will be reflected in all activities on  the topic. Leveraging on previous studies, the Agency  will support  the Commission16 in implementing the  EC toolbox17 on mobile applications to support tracing  in the EU fight against COVID-19.  ENISA will also  encourage stakeholders from this sector to provide  input to the weekly Situational Report (OSINT) during  the difficult times of crisis.  The Agency will also validate the results of the study  (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national  and EU initiatives and interact with healthcare  organisations and policy makers, competent  NIS authorities as well as with experts from the  private sector including operators, integrators  and manufacturers.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the  fields of healthcare security (WP 2015, WP 2019),  smart hospitals (WP 2016) and the NIS Directive  implementation (WP 2017, WP 2019).  Output O.1.1.5 – Building knowledge on maritime  security  The maritime sector plays a key role for the EU  economy and society, accounting for a large segment  of Europe’s overall freight and passenger transport.  However, with the introduction of innovative solutions  based on ICT, the sector has been undergoing a  digital transformation, which is why the cyber risk  profile has changed. Combined with a significant  increase in cyber attacks against key maritime entities  such as ports and shipping companies, this change  highlights the need for cybersecurity to be addressed  in more detail in the maritime sector. As per the  revised EU maritime security strategy action plan,  cybersecurity is important for the sector18.  Accordingly, the Agency will provide maritime  stakeholders (e.g. regulatory authorities,port  authorities, service providers, shipping companies,  vessel manufacturers, solution developers, etc.) with  guidelines for best practices regarding security and  resilience when designing, developing and deploying  16 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/ europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy 17 https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_ en#anchor0 18 https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/maritime- security_en  services to minimise the systems’ and services’ exposure  to all relevant cyber threat categories. The best practices  will take both the current maritime ICT environment  and the emerging trends in terms of business models  and supporting ICT systems into consideration. ENISA  will take stock of current practices and standards and  develop best practices with a focus on resilience of  critical services and user safety, while analysing specific  use cases to determine possible attack scenarios.  ENISA will interact with relevant key stakeholders  from the public sector such as DG MOVE, EMSA,  competent national authorities, and from the  private sector such as managing bodies of ports,  port facilities, water transport companies, vessel  traffic service operators as well as ICT product and  service vendors to collect information and validate  the study’s findings. In particular, due to COVID-19  pandemic and travelling restrictions any necessary  physical workshops will be planned as online events  and the physical event will not take place.  This work builds on previous work of ENISA in the  fields of maritime (WP2011, WP2019), intelligent  transportation systems (WP 2015) and critical smart  infrastructures (WP 2016).

Work programme for the year 2020  the Digital Single Market. Strong encryption is the  basis for secure digital identification systems that play  a key role in effective cybersecurity […]”. Furthermore,  in Article 10 of its proposal for a Regulation of the  European parliament and of the Council on ENISA,  the \"EU Cybersecurity Agency\", repealing Regulation  (EU) 526/2013, of 13 September 2017, the European  Commission is calling ENISA to “[…] advise the  Union and the Member States on research needs  and priorities in the area of cybersecurity, with a  view to enabling effective responses to current and  emerging risks and threats, including with respect to  new and emerging information and communications  technologies, and to using risk-prevention  technologies effective”. Encryption is one of the most  important technologies that fulfills the criteria of a  security and privacy enhancing technology.  While acknowledging the importance of crypto  technologies with regard to cybersecurity, particularly  encryption is still a main focus regarding national  security, especially when it comes to the protection  of sensitive governmental systems as well as critical  information infrastructures. To harmonise both –  market needs and Member States responsibilities  – it is essential to collaborate on sharing existing  approaches, best practices and knowledge.  Due to international standardisation, technical  specifications for cryptographic algorithms already  exist; this should be the goal at European level, too.  Moreover, at European level, the so called SOGIS- MRA Crypto catalogue20, a comprehensive collection  of cryptographic means agreed on by participating  competent authorities of the Member States, is a first  major achievement.  Based on a wider promotion of the SOGIS catalogue  and by working closely with the Member States, ENISA  will act as a catalyst to raise awareness on already  existing cryptographic means. Especially in light of the  new EU certification framework where ENISA plays  a significant role, ENISA will continue the discussion  with the existing SOGIS crypto working group on  possibilities of a long-term relationship and exchange  in 2020. ENISA will also continue to participate in  respective meetings of the group.  With regard to standardisation, ENISA should facilitate  the establishment and adoption of European and  international standards for risk management and for  the security of ICT processes, products and services  which includes cryptography.  ENISA could engage with ETSI groups concerned  with cryptography – primarily TC Cyber and its  20 https://www.sogis.org/uk/supporting_doc_en.html  QSC subgroup as well as TC ESI. ENISA could also  promote the findings of these groups by referring to  them on its website. A similar arrangement could be  utilized for relevant CEN/CENELEC standards groups  (primarily JTC-13 as it begins its work).  Objective 1.2. Cybersecurity Threat  Landscape and Analysis  Output O.1.2.1 – Annual ENISA Threat  Landscape report  The annual ETL report  This report will provide an overview of current  threats and their consequences. It contains tactical  and strategic information about cyber threats. It also  includes threat agents and typical attack vectors.  Hence, the ETL is a source of generic Cyber Threat  Intelligence (CTI) by means of interrelated information  objects. The contents of the report are based on an  intensive information collection exercise, followed  by analysis and consolidation of publicly available  information on cyber threats, including annual  incident reports to the NIS cooperation Group under  the NIS Directives, and directly to ENISA under other  EU legislation.  The ETL  provides information regarding the reduction  of the threat exposure. This information will consist  of available controls that are appropriate to reduce  the exposure and consequently mitigate the resulting  risks. In addition to the report, ENISA will make  available to the public all relevant materials collected  during the year.  The dissemination, concise presentation and online  availability of situational cyberthreat intelligence will  be a major focus in 2020. The available situational  cyberthreat intelligence will be linked to other  relevant ENISA results (see also chapter Objective 1.2.  NIS threat landscape description and analysis).  As a result, ETL stakeholders will be able to access  and interact with ENISA cyberthreat information  permanently. In 2020, ENISA will continue its  cooperation with the CERT-EU on threat landscaping.  This includes a collaboration with the relevant  working group in the CSIRTs Network for information  exchanges, use of CERT-EU services and organisation  of common meetings/events. This work also helps  maintaining and expanding synergies with related  experts (i.e. ENISA ETL Stakeholder Group) and  vendors (through MoUs).  https://www.sogis.org/uk/supporting_doc_en.html  36  CTI EU Event  In 2020, ENISA will continue supporting the relevant  Cyberthreat Intelligence stakeholder community by  supporting best practices for CTI and by providing  an interaction platform. This is the main mobilization  instrument for CTI stakeholders; it will facilitate the  dissemination of CTI information of all kinds by ENISA  (e.g. info note).  Maturing of the European cyber threat intelligence  practice through expert/stakeholder participation  Based on its previous work analysing current and  emerging threats, ENISA will promote best practices in  the field of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) by means of  defining a capability framework and a maturity model, in  collaboration with the stakeholder community.  ENISA will prepare a CTI capability framework by  providing hands-on guidelines on how organisations  can revise their cyber resilience strategies by  introducing technical and non-technical context to  their defence capabilities. The proposed framework  consists of a practical tool that helps organisations  of any size and sector to establish a well-definedCTI  program. It will show concrete requirements, a clear  process, outputs and metrics to evaluate the impact.  The aim of this tool is to promote a shift from a  reactive to a proactive way of thinking regarding  cybersecurity by cybersecurity becoming an integral  part of the organisation’s business and risk strategies.  In addition to the above, ENISA will prepare a CTI  maturity model with practical guidelines on how to  evaluate the current state of the CTI program within  an organisation. The purpose of this tool is to help  organisations to evaluate the maturity of the CTI  Program themselvesand, ultimately, being able to  define a roadmap for continuous improvement.  ENISA will promote knowledge and experience  sharing activities between the members of the cyber  threat intelligence community. As a key initiative,  ENISA will organise an annual meeting/event (CTI-EU)  that mobilises experts, academics and the industry to  debate and plan the future of CTI.  Reporting on emerging cybersecurity threats  ENISA will identify best practices regarding future  technological developments to support the research  of emerging cybersecurity challenges and threats  relevant to all organisations. From the outcome of  this research, ENISA will present a methodology and  practical guidelines to streamline a process to create  informed representations of possible future trends  and scenarios. ENISA expects that the methodolgy will  help organisations to promote internal awareness on  emerging cybersecurity challenges and threats and  define proactive mitigation strategies.  Using the methodology above, ENISA will analyse and  report emerging cybersecurity challenges and threats  via an annual research program. The consideration of  future technological trends and challenges is part of  the planning and knowledge management process of  ENISA. The outcome of this research aims at facilitating  the decisionmaking process in setting priorities for  future ENISA work programs and defining thematic  areas aligned with social and economic needs of  citizens and organisations. The ENISA report on future  cybersecurity challenges and threats is essentially a  source of information about emerging technological  trends that may potentially lead to security challenges  and constrains. The report presents possible  mitigation strategies and emerging security solutions  that attempt to anticipate threats and minimize their  impact. To produce this report, ENISA will conduct a  research process over a whole year. It will  include  the input from a variety of sources and contributions  from members of expert and stakeholder groups  (e.g.researchers, academia, representatives from the  civil society and industry). ENISA expects the report to  promote an extensive discussion and raise awareness  on the topics within the cybersecurity community and  the society as a whole.  Output O.1.2.2 – Restricted and public Info notes  on cybersecurity  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and  developments through information notes. Since 2018,  the Agency has been producing two different types of  ‘CSIRT Info Notes’ and ‘General Info Notes’. This will be  continued in 2020.  CSIRT Info Notes  CSIRT Info Notes cover incidents and/or vulnerabilities  concerning the EU that are within the scope of  activities of the CSIRTs Network. Such notes will only be  published having the approval of the CSIRTs Network  whilst respecting its internal procedures.  General Info Notes  General Info Notes cover significant developments  and announcements in the field of cybersecurity with  the sole purpose of promoting general awareness  and presenting actionable mitigation strategies.  General Info Notes are not meant as a response to  incidents or vulnerabilities but rather as explanatory  reviews, neutral and independent analyses of major  events that have reached a certain level of public  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 37  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  and media attention. For creating General Info Notes,  ENISA will consult the CSIRTs Network but also other  appropriate resources.  ENISA provides objective information regarding such  events covering issues, points of action, mitigation  measures, summaries, related practices, etc. Hence,  the aim of these notes is to provide a neutral  overview of the current state and raise awareness  of the essence of the threat by an objective analysis  shortly after the event.  Both types of information notes will be integrated  into the cyber-threat information, thus functioning as  a single knowledge hub.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing information  notes as a reliable and continuous service to its  stakeholders in a timely manner.  Just as with the ETL, ENISA will continue to improve  the dissemination efficiency of the produced CTI  information notes. For this purpose, available  dissemination channels will be used to enhance  adoption among key stakeholders. In addition to  the ENISA website, in 2020 information notes will be  disseminated via the ENISA ETL platform.  Output O.1.2.3 – Support incident reporting  activities in the EU  As EU level incident reporting obligations have  been introduced under multiple types of legislative  instruments, developing efficient reporting schemes  across sectors and geographical borders is one of  the objectives for ENISA in this sector. Such reporting  schemes should be simple, pragmatic and relevant  for the public and private sector respectively without  increasing the cost of operation.  Current and future activities in this area include:  Incident notifications in the telecom sector  (Article 13a of the Telecoms framework directive  to be replaced by Article 40 of the EU Electronic  Communications Code (EECC);ENISA currently  supports the activities of the Article 13a Expert  Group dealing with general surveillance of security  in the telecom sector and producing annual  summary reports on telecom incidents. In this  context, ENISA works closely with several industry  groups and supports the Article 13a expert group  in the analysis of cross- cutting security issues.  The new EECC will require substantial work and  support as the scope of monitoring and reporting  and security breaches will expand.  38  Incident notification for the trust services sector  (Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation): Electronic trust  services are a growing sector and are becoming  increasingly important with many cross-border  dependencies. ENISA plays a key role in the  collection and alaysis of security incidents from  across the EU. In 2020, ENISA will analyse security  incidents and produce a consolidated, anonymised  annual report. In addition, ENISA, in collaboration  with the Member States, will will gather experience  from previous incidents and recommend best  practices. In this context, ENISA also engages with  the private sector and with relevant fora such as  the FESA and the eID expert group.  Incident notifications under the NIS Directive:  In 2018, ENISA provided templates. ENISA will  work with the European Commission and the  Member States to exploit synergies in the different  notification schemes. ENISA will also engage with  the European Commission and competent national  authorities to develop sectoral approaches to  incident notification that best suit each sector. In  this context, ENISA supports the efficient flow of  information on mandatory and voluntary incident  notifications to establish a common picture across  sectors and the EU.  ENISA has extensive expertise in producing  summary incident reports at EU level through  the work with Member States and telecom  providers on the transposition of Article 13a of the  Telecommunications Framework Directive of 2009,  and Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation. In the light  of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, reporting on the  continuity of services in the telecom sector increased  and ENISA will analyse further this information under  the request of the sector or under the request of the  Member States.  Output O.1.2.4 – Supporting PSIRTs and NIS  sectoral incident response expertise  For this particular output, ENISA, supporting the MS,  will collect and analyse best practices for sectoral  CSIRTs and product CSIRTs (PSIRTs) to support  incident response (IR) expertise implementation  according to the Annex I and Annex II requirements of  the NIS Directive.  ENISA will also support the dissemination of PSIRT  and sectoral IR best practices. This will enable  stakeholders to better adopt NISD CSIRT requirements  in their businesses and reinforce cooperation with  product CSIRTs (PSIRT). All this will enable more  efficient incident management practices and will thus  contribute to a more agile adaptation of established  CSIRT expertise and collaboration practices on  incidents, threats and vulnerabilities in the EU.  Objective 1.3. Research & Development,  Innovation  Output O.1.3.1 – Supporting EU research &  development programmes  ENISA will continue providing analyses of the areas  covered by the NIS Directive, the Cybersecurity  Package, the COM decision on cPPP and the  outcomes of relevant Horizon2020 projects, e.g. the  CSA projects (cyberwatching, AEGIS and EU-Unity),  and will aim at showing where funded R&D activities  in the context of H2020, TRANSITS and GEANT  would achieve the greatest impact. ENISA will work  in close cooperation with the respective European  Commission services on cybersecurity aspects related  to the General Data Protection Regulation. The  Agency will also monitor and analyse cybersecurity  related directives and initiatives in various sectors  (e.g. space, maritime, defence, transport, automotive)  and evaluate the specific threat landscape in these  critical sectors.  ENISA will adapt the current best practices and  guidelines for protecting EU systems and networks,  services, IoT and cloud ecosystems as well as supply  chains according to the evolving threats in addition to  building specific used cases that can be adopted by  the IT Security community.  Additionally, ENISA will continue supporting and  advising the European Commission, organisations  in this area, other agencies (e.g. EDA, ESA), industrial  communities and the Member States to meet their  goals by provding its concrete NIS policy expertise.  The Agency will also be make contributions regarding  the proposal on the creation of the Cybersecurity  Competence Network with a European Cybersecurity  Research and Competence Centre21. In this  context, ENISA will work closely with the European  Cybersecurity Research and Competence Centre for  the network to be set up.  21 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/ PDF/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 39  PART III.

Supporting EU policy  development  Output O.2.1.1 – Supporting policy developments  in NIS Directive sectors  While the NIS Directive addresses elements of  cybersecurity in different sectors (OESs and DSPs),  there are several initiatives at EU and MS level that  involve cybersecurity and are orthogonal to the  work conducted in the context of the NIS Directive.  An indicative yet not exhaustive list of examples  includes the work from DG MOVE on the Cooperative  Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS), the work  from EASA on the introduction of requirements for  the management of information security risks by  organisations involved in civil aviation activity, the  work from DG FISMA and ECB on finance-related  regulations, DG GROW’s work on the Medical  Devices Regulation (MDR), the work of DG SANTE  in the eHealth Network (eHN) and the Joint Action  Plan, as well as forthcoming work from DG ENER on  cybersecurity for the energy sector.  Taking into account recent legislative and policy  developments in sectors that are defined in the  NIS Directive (OESs and DSPs), ENISA will work with  the European Commission, Member States and EU  agencies to promote coordinated efforts for sectoral  cybersecurity in the EU. Any planned activity in the  field of cybersecurity in sectors of the NIS Directive  that is foreseen in the WP will respect existing EU  and national efforts and interests, while taking  the ongoing legislative process into consideration.  Restrictions and further requests stemming from  the COVID-19 pandemic will be reflected in the  corresponding activities.  The Agency will provide support to the European  Commission and the Member States regarding  policies related to sectors of the NIS Directive by  stocktaking of the different initiatives from the  different sectors. In doing so, the Agency will map  policies affecting the NISD sectors and the role and  responsibilities of the involved actors. The results  of this mapping will be validated by all related  stakeholders. Moreover, upon request, the Agency  will support the development of relevant policy  initiatives with the aim to ensure coordinated efforts  across the EU.  Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy  implementation  Output O.2.2.1 – Recommendations supporting  implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public  and private bodies in implementing the eIDAS  Regulation by addressing risk, assurance and  technology aspects to provide dependable trust  and electronic identification services. Aspects to  be covered will be discussed with the European  Commission and Member States through the eIDAS  experts group. Interaction with actors from the  private sector will enhance the Agency’s ability to  make further meaningful contributions to this area.  By implementing the Cybersecurity Act, ENISA will  offer analytical support, thus supporting the efforts  of the Member States and the European Commission  in the field of electronic identity. To produce  specific implementation guidelines and technical  recommendations, a number of stakeholders and  collaboration areas will be consulted to address  operational aspects of trust service providers,  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 41  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  conformity assessment bodies and supervisory  authorities while leveraging past experiences to  emphasise implementation and interoperability.  ENISA will also collaborate closely with the eIDAS  Expert Group (Trust Services) and the Cooperation  Network (established by the European Commission  Implementing Decision 2015/296) to exchange  information and share best practices. These  recommendations will complement the existing  knowledge base that ENISA already created for the  trust service providers.  ENISA will take the recommendations and standards  developed by CEN/CENELEC, ETSI and the ISO and  IEC into account and seek to avoid duplication and  conflict of the approaches. In this regard, ENISA  will support the European Commission to assess  applicable standards by reviewing them to decide  to what extent they meet the requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation. Furthermore, ENISA will continue  to support the European Commission, as appropriate,  with the implementation of specific areas of interest  such as qualified time stamps, qualified website  authentication certificates, mobile applications etc.  Lastly, ENISA will support the European Commission  with the implementation aspects and tasks related  to Article 49 of the eIDAS as well as the review of  the eIDAS Regulation to an extent that needs to be  identified by the Commission.  Output O.2.2.2 – Supporting the implementation  of the work programme of the Cooperation Group  under the NIS Directive  ENISA has been supporting the European  Commission and the MS with the development  of the NIS Cooperation Group’s 2018-2020 work  programme. It will contribute to the discussions  and assist the European Commission and MS in  the development of the Cooperation Group’s work  programme 2020-2021. In this context, supporting  the NIS Cooperation Group, ENISA will also analyse  specific issues and draft working papers, consult with  competent authorities of the Member States’ and  collect and develop best practice recommendations.  ENISA will leverage its expertise in Critical Information  Infrastructure Protections, National Cyber Security  Strategies, CSIRTs, security assessment frameworks,  baseline security requirements and incident  notification in different critical sectors (such as  energy, transport, finance etc.), standardisation, ICT  certification and others to contribute to the different  work streams of the Cooperation Group. Contribution  refers to both the existing and ongoing work streams  on, e.g. security measures, incident reporting, energy  sector security, large scale incident taxonomy, etc.,  as well as forthcoming ones that will be specified  and discussed for the Cooperation Group’s  work programme.  ENISA will also take stock of experience gained in  the first two years of the implementation of the  NISD and will recommend best practices for the  implementation of the Directive to the Cooperation  Group and the Ëuropean Commission.  Taking into account the evolving threat landscape  and the experience gained from the implementation  of the NISD, ENISA will continue supporting the  European Commission and the Member States with  the overview of the NISD implementation and its  evaluation by the Member States and the European  Commission. In this respect, ENISA will support the  European Commission and the MS by leveraging the  input from the Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs  Network (in its capacity as the Secretariat for the  CSIRTs Network, ENISA will facilitate the preparation  of the next evaluation report for the Cooperation  Group – Output 4.2.1) evaluating the implementation  of the NISD and contribute to the discussions on the  development of potentially forthcoming regulatory  and/or policy initiatives.  Output O.2.2.3 – Contribute to the EU policy in the  area of privacy and data protection with technical  input on cybersecurity related measures  Within the scope of its cybersecurity mandate,  ENISA will support and promote trust and security  in digital services regarding privacy and data  protection. In close cooperation with institutional  (European Commission, EDPS) stakeholders and  the MS, including the European Data Protection  Board (EDPB), ENISA  will work within its mandate  to support the technical analysis of cybersecurity  measures, e.g. technical and organisational measures  and mechanisms relevant to data protection  ENISA will take the  recommendations and  standards developed  by CEN/CENELEC,  ETSI, ISO and IEC into  account and seek to  avoid duplication  42  by design and by default (such as for example  pseudonymisation and anonymisation techniques),  security of processing, security and integrity of  networks and electronic communication services,  etc. ENISA will further extend its cooperation with  the Data Protection Authorities of the Member States  and with the EDPB and support their cybersecurity  requirements in the field of personal data protection  and privacy. Most importantly, ENISA will continue  contributing in a technical capacity to the work of the  EDPB, as it already did by supporting the European  Commission since 2019.  Currently, in its 8th edition, the Annual Privacy  Forum (APF) will remain the instrument of choice to  gather key communities, namely policy, academia  and industry, in the broader area of privacy and  data protection while focusing on privacy related  application areas. Cooperation activities with  European Data Protection Supervisors, the European  Data Protection Board and national Data Protection  Authorities will be pursued further.  Output O.2.2.4 – Guidelines for the European  standardisation in the field of ICT security  Building on its own policy work, existing standards and  the requirements of the Member States, this activity  will seek to make a gap analysis available and/or  provide guidance to implement existing NIS standards.  Additionally, ENISA manages the relationship it has  developed with the EU SDOs (CEN/CENELEC and ETSI)  and with international standardisation organisations  (ISO and IEC) by contributing to standardisation  work at the strategic and tactical levels (e.g. by  joining appropriate working and management  groups, observing relevant technical and conference  programme committees and co-organising conferences  etc.). New requirements primarily associated with the  implementation and secondly transposition of the EU  legal instruments in place in the Member States will  be taken into account, including aspects of the NIS  Directive, the Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, as well as the  preparation for the upcoming ePrivacy Regulation, etc.  This output will analyse gaps and, in particular, provide  guidelines for  the development or amendment of  standards, facilitating the promulgation and adoption  of NIS standards. ENISA provides its technical and  organisational NIS know-how, which can be further  leveraged to extend or assess standards to render  them more appropriate to stakeholders. By bringing  its concrete NIS policy expertise to the table, ENISA  will produce “how to” and “what else” guides in to  contribute to the European standardisation.  ENISA will thus, where appropriate, discuss that  matterwith the Member States, industry and standard  developing organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN, CENELEC), as  well as European Commission services and agencies  with policy competence.  Output O.2.2.5 – Supporting the implementation  of the European Electronic Communications Code  The European Electronic Communications Code  (EECC), replacing the current Telecom framework  directive that was in place since 2009, brings  important changes to the electronic communications  landscape and to the work of the telecom regulators  across the EU. The new code was adopted in 2018  and is expected to bring more harmonisation at  EU level and several improvements regarding the  security such as:  broadens the scope of application to include  number-independent (Ni) interpersonal  communications services (commonly known as  Over-The-Top (OTT) services),  a broader definition of security incidents, which  is aligned with the definitions in the NIS Directive  and in eIDAS, which will result in more types of  incidents being reported.  In light of the potential impact of the pandemic  on the resilience and availability of electronic  communications, ENISA will support competent  authorities of the Member States with the transition,  the new supervision tasks, and liaise with relevant  industry players to support an effective, efficient  and streamlined implementation of the security  requirements (Article 40) of the EECC. ENISA will build  on the Article 13a Expert Group and its contacts to the  private sector to define guidelines and best practices.  As the competent authorities for the EECC of many  Member States are the same authorities that  supervise the Digital Service Providers and the Digital  Infrastructure under the NIS Directive, ENISA will  ensure that this output remains closely aligned with  the ongoing NISD work in the relevant NIS Cooperation  Group work-streams.  Output O.2.2.6 – Support the MS in improving the  cybersecurity of 5G networks  Given the actions regarding 5G in 2019, a number of  upcoming activities for 2020 are envisaged. For these  activities, ENISA will deliver technical content in support  of EU-wide 5G actions. Thus, ENISA’s contribution  is the provision of technical evidence needed for  policymaking. ENISA is ready for follow-up activities  under its remit, following the discussions between  the EU Members States and with the European  Commission regarding the toolbox initiative.

SUPPORT  EUROPE MAINTAINING STATE-OF-THE- ART INFORMATION SECURITY NETWORK  AND CAPACITIES  Objective 3.1. Assist Member States’  capacity building  Output O.3.1.1 – Technical trainings for MS and  EU bodies  In 2020, most of the activities in this field aim at  maintaining and extending the collection of best  practice guidelines and trainings for CSIRT and other  operational personnel such as product CSIRT (PSIRT)  or operators of essential services (OES). The Agency  will support the development of national incident  response preparedness of the Member States by  providing best practice guidance on key elements of  NIS capacity building with a focus on CSIRT/PSIRT/ OES trainings and services to improve the skills of  the operational teams and their personnel. ENISA will  further build on the successful work in the field of  ‘training methodologies’.  In detail, the Agency will continue to provide updated  training materials according to the findings of the  stocktaking study for trainings in NISD sectors. As  a result ENISA will be able to provide a new set of a  training materials based on emerging technologies  to reinforce the MS’ operational skills and CSIRT/  PSIRT capacities to efficiently manage cybersecurity  events. A special emphasis is placed on supporting the  MS and EU bodies with concrete guidance (like best  practice materials) and concrete actions (like trainings).  ENISA will also offer, upon request, direct support to  individual Member States to provide technical trainings  and advisories on best effort basis. Last but not least,  ENISA will continue supporting TRANSITS trainings.  In 2020, ENISA will further enhance its methodology,  seminars and trainings on:  a)  core CSIRT services such as incident handling,  digital forensics and vulnerability management,  b) cyber crisis management and,  c) the organisation and management of exercises.  The Agency will provide continuous support and  development of TRANSITS trainings, which is a  positive and important aspect for the capacity  building of the MS. This activity is based on the  recently developed materials and infrastructures  for on site and online trainings on these subjects. In  addition, this activity will cover the delivery of these  trainings upon request.  Output O.3.1.2 – Support EU MS in the  development and assessment of NCSS  The NIS Directive’s priority for the MS is to  adopt a national NIS strategy and to monitor its  implementation. Since 2017, all 28 MS have published  a national NIS strategy. However, in order to align  the objectives of the existing National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS) with the requirements of the NISD,  many MS need to update their current NCSS.  ENISA will continue assisting EU MS to develop their  capabilities in the area of NCSS. The Agency can build  on its work from previous years and will assist the MS to  deploy existing best practices in the relevant fields and  offer targeted assistance on specific NCSS objectives  (e.g. CIIP, creation of PPPs etc.). A priority will be to  support the MS to create a NCSS that is in line with  the priorities and requirements of the NIS Directive.  Each year, the Agency focuses on one of the objectives  of the strategy (e.g. collaboration, CIIP, governance).  ENISA will investigate the activities of the MS and  examine best practices and new potential incentives  such as the sectoral NCSS. In the current situation of  the COVID-19 pandemic, ENISA will analyse the ability  of EU SMEs to cope with cybersecurity issues in a crisis  such as COVID-19 and to provide recommendations for  improvement; cybersecurity topics like how to handle  phishing campaigns or to mitigate ransomware attacks  will be included. SMEs are considered a vital part of  society and business, thus in scope of every NCSS.  ENISA will continue supporting the MS in evaluating  their NCSS and their NIS initiatives. The Agency  will update its NCSS assessment methodology  and validate it with the help of public and private  stakeholders. Then, ENISA will make this assessment  methodology available to the MS to use is whenever  needed for implementation. Finally, ENISA will  enhance the NCSS map.  Output O.3.1.3 – Support EU MS in their incident  response development  In 2020, ENISA will focus its efforts on supporting the  MS to enhance their incident response capabilities by  assisting them with their CSIRT maturity assessments  and enhancements, for example with CSIRTs  Network members‘ peer review maturity evaluation.  In addition, the Agency will continue to monitor the  CSIRT landscape development in Europe and provide  an updated view on the CSIRT landscape and incident  response practice development in Europe. In close  cooperation with the NISD CSIRTs Network and the  Connecting Europe Facility’s MeliCERTes initiative,  the Agency will support the development of national  incident response capabilities of the Member States  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 45  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  by providing recommendations and advisory on key  requirements of NIS capability building with a focus  on the development and efficiency of national and  sectoral CSIRTs. ENISA will also offer, upon request,  direct support to individual Member States to evaluate  and improve their incident response capabilities.  The main objectives of this output in 2020 is to help  MS and other ENISA incident response stakeholders,  such as EU institutions, bodies and agencies, to  develop, implement and enhance their incident  response capabilities and services to meet the  increasing challenges of securing their networks.  Another objective of this output is to further develop  and apply ENISA’s recommendations for CSIRT  baseline capabilities, maturity assessments and  corresponding tools. As a continuous effort, ENISA will  continue supporting cross-border CSIRT community  projects, tool development and the global dialog  about common issues and challenges regarding the  topic of incident response.  Output O.3.1.4 – ISACs for the NISD Sectors  in the EU and MS  For many years, ENISA has been working closely with  the main operators of essential services in the EU. It  has set up several sectoral expert groups covering  sectors such as maritime, finance and health.24  Through this effort and based on this experience  with sectors or sector-specific topics like ICS/SCADA,  ENISA holds a unique position in the EU to fulfil a  key role regarding EU focused ISACs. It is for the  obvious choice for ENISA to continue its activities  from the last 10 years to coordinate, in conjunction  with CEF funding, the further development and  implementation of EU ISACs in the next decade. ENISA  is already cooperating with the European Commission  to develop the ISAC facilities manager concept, which  is based on proposals to develop ISACs references in  the CEF Telecom 2018 Work Programme25.  ENISA has been working on the topic of CIIP since  2010, so it is uniquely prepared to assume a special  role in Pan European sectoral ISAC. Some indicative  (but not exhaustive) examples include:  EU Energy ISAC: ENISA plays a key role in the  development and professionalisation of this  ISAC. ENISA is a full member and responsible for  providing expertise through organising webinars  and educational sessions for its members. In  September 2017 and November 2019, it hosted an  24 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information- infrastructures-and-services  25 https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef- telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  ISAC meeting in Athens. The EE-ISAC members are  preferably operators.  EU Financial Institutions ISAC: This ISAC is the  oldest one and ENISA has been actively involved  for many years. It supports the ISAC, for example  by hosting the mailing list. ENISA’s involvement is  mainly to legitimise EU participation. ENISA is an  observer.  EU Rail ISAC: ENISA facilitates the European  Railway operators (infrastructure managers and  railway undertakings) creating the European  Rail ISAC. Currently, more than 23 European  stakeholders and the European Railway Agency  (ERA) participate in this ISAC. ENISA offers  experience and support.  The September 2017 Joint Communication states:  “Some first steps have been taken regarding specific  critical sectors such as aviation and energy through  the creation of EASA and by developing information  sharing and analysis centres. The European  Commission will fully contribute to this approach  with support from ENISA. An acceleration is needed,  particularly, with regard to sectors providing essential  services as identified in the NIS directive.”  ENISA will support the MS during the entire lifecycle  of national/European ISACs by engaging all relevant  stakeholders: competent national bodies, the  private sector, i.e. operators of essential services or  manufacturers, and other relevant bodies. ENISA  will also explore the possibility of synergies across  national ISACs and EU sectoral ones. The Agency  will also consider utilising its sectoral expertise that  it has acquired through past and current efforts to  offer support (upon request) to ISACs by sharing  knowledge, e.g. in the form of webinars and other  means of communicating knowledge. This will help  the private companies operating in numerous MS to  have increased benefits from such a collaboration.  Restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic situation will  be reflected in the corresponding activities (physical  meetings are replaced by online ones).  Objective 3.2. Support EU institutions’  capacity building  Output O.3.2.1 – Liaison with the EU agencies on  operational issues related to CERT-EU’s activities  Since December 2017, ENISA has participated as a  Member of the Steering Board of CERT-EU, as the  representative of EU descentralised agencies that  use the services of CERT-EU. In this context, ENISA  will liaise with the EU agencies on operational issues  related to CERT-EU’s activities particularly through the  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/critical-information-infrastructures-and-services https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals  46  ICTAC (ICT Advisory Committee) of the EU agencies  and generally to ensure that the viewpoints of the  agencies are adequately represented. In this context,  ENISA will also report to the CERT-EU steering board  on the evolution of services required by the agencies.  Output O.3.2.2. – Cooperation with relevant  EU institutions, agencies and other bodies on  cybersecurity initiatives  ENISA has increased the cooperation efforts with a  number of EU institutions and agencies and contributed  to the preparation of activities linked to cybersecurity of  to the Presidencies. In 2020, ENISA will keep intensifying  its cooperation efforts on cybersecurity with EU  institutions and agencies and other relevant bodies  regarding the cybersecurity dimension of their mandate.  This encompasses building on the Memorandum of  Understanding and associated implementation activities  on collaboration with EC3, EDA and CERT-EU. As such,  ENISA will liaise with the relevant EU agencies (26)  (including EASA, EC3, CERT-EU, EDA — including civil/ defence cooperation, EEAS, etc.). In addition to the  organisation of exercises in close collaboration with  Activity 4 (in particular O.4.1.1, O.4.1.2, O.4.1.3 and  O.4.1.5), the relevant EU Agencies will closely collaborate  regarding the establishment of common standard  operating procedures to support the EU Cyber Crisis  Cooperation Framework.  Objective 3.3. Awareness raising  Output O.3.3.1 – European Cyber Security  Challenges  Both the growing need for IT security professionals  and the skills shortage are widely acknowledged. To  help solve this problem, ENISA is supporting national  cybersecurity competitions for students, security  professionals and even non-IT professionals, with the  goal to find new cyber talents and encourage them to  pursue a career in cybersecurity.  It is ENISA's aim to turn the ECSC into one of the largest  EU cybersecurity events, where all EU and EFTA countries  will participate. The ECSC brand should be associated  with Europe’s top cybersecurity talents and, by adding  spinoffs such as hackathons and start-ups camps, ENISA  expects the ECSC to become one of the key incubators of  cybersecurity entrepreneurship in Europe.  26 Memorandum of Understanding between the European  Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), The  European Defence Agency (EDA), Europol’s European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3), The Computer Emergency Response Team for  the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU), available at:  https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/ mou—eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3—23-05-18.pdf  Thus, in order to promote capacity building and  awareness in NIS among youths and future EU MS  cyber security experts, ENISA will continue to promote  and advise the EU MS on hosting national ‘Cyber  Security Challenge’ competitions.  The Agency will also continue supporting to plan  and develop the European Cyber Security Challenge  2020. The goal for 2020 will be to further increase the  interest in this type of event by promoting excellence  in the form of cyber competitions. In the future,  the ECSC’s final competition could be followed by  the creation of a ‘Team Europe’ that will represent  Europe in potentialinternational competitions. To this  extend, ENISA has already established some contacts  with representatives of similar competitions in other  regions outside Europe.  Output O.3.3.2 – European Cyber Security  Month deployment  In 2020, ENISA will continue to support the EU MS in  promoting activities to raisecybersecurity awareness  like the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM). The  ECSM is addresses disparity of cybersecurity practices  across Member States in two stages. The first stage is  to support the Member States to increase awareness  and optimise the behaviour of their citizens to achieve  a solid foundation. The second stage should help to  further lower cybersecurity risks by increasing the  maturity of the citizen’s behaviour at the European level.  ENISA and the European Commission can achieve  the objectives of the European Cyber Security Month  by utilising the pan-European campaign to ensure all  Member States are actively committed to the European  Cyber Security Month and that the industry is involved  as well. The proposed pillars remain the same: support  a multi-stakeholder governance approach; encouraging  common public-private activities; assess the impact of  activities, optimising and adapting to new challenges.  Output O.3.3.3 – Support EU MS in cybersecurity  skills development  ENISA will promote a series of new activities regarding  cybersecurity skills development which will focus on  identifying current national and EU wide initiatives.  The main output of this activity will be a summary of  existing services and programs in the EU that aim at  enhancing cybersecurity skills among EU citizens, in  general, and cybersecurity experts, in particular. As  part of this program, a skill development scheme and  maturity model will be defined based on existing and  similar frameworks and initiatives.  https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf https://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/mou---eda-enisa-cert-eu-ec3---23-05-18.pdf  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 47  PART III.

FOSTER  THE OPERATIONAL  COOPERATION WITHIN THE EUROPEAN  CYBERSECURITY COMMUNITY  Objective 4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation  Output O.4.1.1 – Planning of Cyber Europe 2020  Initially planned for summer 2020, ENISA will organise  the fifth pan-European cyber exercise, the so-called  Cyber Europe 2020 (CE2020), in Q1 of 2021. The  change was made due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In 2019, ENISA will prepare the plan for the CE2020.  This exercise will closely follow up and build on the  experiences from previous exercises such as CE2018.  CE2020 will focus on testing capabilities and  procedures, namely large-scale incident management  cooperation procedures at EU and national levels.  The crisis escalation scenario will be realistic to  better capture how incidents are being managed  and how cooperation works in real life. The exercise  will include explicit scenarios for the CSIRTs network,  single point of contacts and competent authorities  established under the NIS Directive. It will also  focus on at least one essential sector. The exercise  will also be designed to offer the opportunity to  train the different aspects included in the Cyber  Crisis Collaboration Blueprint, that was developed  in collaboration with the European Commission,  while also taking into account the recommendations  provided by the NIS Cooperation Group (e.g. the  ‘cybersecurity Incident Taxonomy’ or those on  ‘Cooperation procedures amongst Member States  and functions and capabilities of the national single  point of contact’). Depending on the resources, in  2021, ENISA will also expand the role of the observers  (introduced in 2018) to add more value for the  exercise overall.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include  the strategic dimensions of the exercise and will be  prepared based on the experiences from CE2019 . To  drive the whole planning process ENISA will assemble  a group of planners from the participating countries  to jointly develop a detailed exercise plan (ExPlan) in  2020 . ENISA will involve planning group during the  whole process and incorporate their input to create  a consented plan. The exercise planning will avoid  overlaps with other major related activities.  ENISA will consult the MS and seek approval of ENISA’s  Management Board after consultation with the  Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs Network  on a possible joint EU-NATO cyber exercise in the  coming years.  Output O.4.1.2 – Support activities for cyber  exercises  In 2014, ENISA started the development of the Cyber  Exercise Platform (CEP). The CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States and  EU Institutions such as: exercise organisation and  management, exercise playground with technical  incidents, map of exercises and hosting the exercise  development community.  In addition, new content and exercise incident  challenges and materials will be developed to keep  up the interest of the stakeholders and make the  CEP a central tool for cybersecurity exercising for  all stakeholders. The CEP platform enables ENISA to  enlarge the user base and thus offer the operational  cyber security communities opportunities to exercise  and gain experience and increase their knowledge .  One way to develop exercise incident materials is to  engage the expert community.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 49  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  Output O.4.1.3 – Support activities for  cybersecurity collaboration with other EU  institutions and bodies  ENISA will work with other EU institutions and bodies  to developcybersecurity collaboration tasks based on  an agreed roadmap.  In particular, ENISA will further develop bilateral and  multilateral cooperation with:  DG Connect  the European Cybercrime Centre at Europol  (Europol/EC3)  the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (INTCEN)  the EU Military Staff Intelligence Directorate  (EUMS INT) and Situation Room (SITROOM),  working together as SIAC (the Single Intelligence  Analysis Capacity)  the European Defence Agency (EDA)  the Computer Emergency Response Team for the  EU Institutions (CERT-EU)  the Emergency Response Coordination Centre in  the European Commission  ENISA will also collaborate with the aforementioned  organisations to build capacities and synergies in the  areas of training, education and cyber skills.  Output O.4.1.4 – Supporting the implementation  of the information hub  Decision-supporting intelligence in the cybersecurity  domain is scarce despite today’s security information  overload27. ENISA is at the crossroads of most, if  not all, public-private, cross-sector cybersecurity  communities in Europe, from the technical to the  strategic level. As indicated in the EC Communication  on building strong cybersecurity for the EU28, ENISA  serves as “the focal point for information and  knowledge in the cybersecurity community”. As  a result, ENISA is in a unique position to leverage  its network to gather information, process it  and promote timely, tailored and highly relevant  situational awareness to support decision-making in  both the public and the private European sectors as  recommended by the EC in the blueprint:  “As part of the regular cooperation at technical level  to support Union situational awareness, ENISA should  prepare the EU Cybersecurity Technical Situation  Report on incidents and threats on a regular basis,  based on publicly available information, its own  27 Scott J., Spaniel D.

The  report should be available to the relevant instances of  the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the  HRVP and the CSIRTs Network.”  To support the creation of the EU Cybersecurity  Technical Situation reports and to process the  massive amounts of inputs they require in a  meaningful way, ENISA has initiated the development  of a tool that acts as a cybersecurity news sources  aggregator, provides awareness and assists threat  analysts in drafting cybersecurity reports in 2018.  A first prototype is in place and has been reviewed  by experts from ENISA, different EU institutions and  the private sector to validate its added value for  their work. In 2019, the next development phase will  commence to get a ready to use product by the end  of 2019 or beginning 2020 . The tool is using the latest  developments in AI and natural language processing  to facilitate the creation of EU cybersecurity reports  by providing a specialized cybersecurity search  engine, that monitors trending news regarding  cybersecurity 24/7 and has immediate access to  ENISA’s own work on relevant subjects. Additional  functionalities and improvements will be added  periodically according to the latest technological  evolutions and the users’ needs.  For this particular output, ENISA will rely on  the experiences gained drafting the former EU  Cybersecurity Technical Situation Reports with the  prototype to further develop the Natural Language  Processing features for the tool to transition from  paragraph-based proposals to the production of  meaningful sentences. Similarly, this experience will be  leveraged to improve the Machine Learning algorithms  of the prototype to significantly increase the number  and type of information sources to be monitored.  Output O.4.1.5 – Supporting the EU Cyber Crisis  Cooperation Blueprint  ENISA will support the European Commission  on the implementation and improvement of the  cybersecurity blueprint. As specified in the blueprint:  “The EU Cybersecurity Crisis Response Framework  should in particular identify the relevant […]EU  institutions […] at all necessary levels – technical,  operational, strategic/political – and  develop, where  necessary, standard operating procedures that define  the way in which these cooperate within the context  of EU crisis management mechanisms. Emphasis  should be placed on enabling the exchange of  information without undue delay and coordinating  the response during large-scale cybersecurity  incidents and crises.”  Based on the European Commission’s guidance  and experiences from the EU PACE exercise, ENISA  will drive initiatives to mitigate identified gaps in  cooperation between:  EU cybersecurity stakeholders’ main actors like  DG Connect, the European Cybercrime Centre at  Europol (Europol/EC3), the EU Intelligence Analysis  Centre (INTCEN), the EU Military Staff Intelligence  Directorate (EUMS INT) and Situation Room  (SITROOM) working together as SIAC (the Single  Intelligence Analysis Capacity), the EU Hybrid  Fusion Cell (based in INTCEN), the Computer  Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions  (CERT-EU), the Emergency Response Coordination  Centre in the European Commission and possibly  the Cybersecurity Emergency Response Fund.  The rest of EU bodies, agencies and institutions  that should be under the EU cybersecurity  blueprint umbrella for handling and mitigation of  cyber oriented crises.  ENISA will drive working groups to initiate or  continue developing procedures in the context of  the blueprint, from defining emergency directories  and update processes to structuring cooperation  activities during crises. This are the priorities named  listed in the Blueprint.  ENISA will assist the Member States to engage in the  EU Cybersecurity Crisis Response Framework with  National Cybersecurity Crisis Response Frameworks.  Furthermore, upon request or emerging needs,  ENISA will organise workshops and/or table-top  exercises to validate that these procedures facilitate  information exchange without undue delay, prior  to their use – either in real life or in larger exercises  such as Cyber Europe.  Objective 4.2. Community building and  operational cooperation  Output O.4.2.1 – EU CSIRTs Network support  ENISA will continue to support the European  Commission and Member States in the implementation  of the NIS Directive, in particular, in the area of CSIRTs.  As part of this activity, ENISA will continue its tasks  as the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively  support its functionality by suggestions to improve  cooperation and trust building between CSIRTs.  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 51  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  Special emphasis will be given to reinforce the  CNW infrastructure and priority will be given to the  operational tasks such as supporting the alert or full  cooperation mode of the CNW during large cross- border incident or crisis (e.g. Covid-19 cyber).The CNW  secretariat will provide support with MS situational  reports synthesis and production of the executive  summary for reporting to the Cooperation Group  as defined in the CNW SOPs. The CSIRTs Network  infrastructure and tools (including its alignment with  MeliCERTes instances) will also be improved.  The Agency will also support this cooperation, upon  request by the members of the CSIRTs Network, by  developing best practices and providing guidance in  the area of operational community efforts such as on  information exchange and secure communication. In  particular, the Agency will be proactive in stimulating  discussions within the network and  providing content  to support discussions on policy and technical  initiatives according to the CSIRTs Network’s own  work programme.  Trust and mutual respect is an important asset for  CSIRT operations. Therefore, ENISA will continue to  improve the level of trust in the network by offering  trust building exercises and events in coordination  with the CSIRTs Network governance. ENISA will take  an active role in facilitating consensus between all  Member States who participate in the CSIRTs Network  in accordance with the NIS Directive.  The Agency will further provide, improve, develop and  secure the CSIRTs Network infrastructure and tools  including its alignment with MeliCERTes instances for  CSIRTs Network member’s smooth collaboration and  administration use (e.g. CSIRTs Network portal and  other communication means).  Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration across CSIRTs, LEA  and other operational communities  In 2020, ENISA will continue collaborating directly or  indirectly with key stakeholders such as EUROPOL/ EC3, and possibly other affected agencies (e.g. CEPOL,  Eurojust) to support the cooperation between the  CSIRT and the law enforcement communities and the  extensions that this collaboration may have to other  affected communities of stakeholders. ENISA is likely  to continue its analysis and the production of training  materials based on such analyses to lower the  barriers for cooperation across these communities.  In addition, the Agency will continue collaborating  with other operational EU bodies to ensure a  structured cooperation with CERT-EU, European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3), EDA and other relevant EU  bodies in line with the provisions of the Cybersecurity  Act. The goal of the cooperation can be to reach  joint policy outcomes to sustain the fight against  cyber-crime; as such an interactive discussion format  to identify root causes for limitations regarding  cooperation can be considered, alongside trainings  and joint workshops.  Output O.4.2.3 – Supporting the operations of  MeliCERTes platform  ENISA is committed to keep supporting the  MeliCERTes platform, which is envisaged as the  primary collaboration platform between participating  Member States’ CSIRTs and which is helping to  enlarge the EU MS’ preparedness, cooperation and  coordination to effectively respond to emerging cyber  threats and to cross-border incidents.  Any particular CSIRT needs to maintain its data within  the MeliCERTes framework. Some of the data must  be vetted by the centralized workflow – such as the  mandate or memberships in CSIRT communities –to  correctly reflect any changes in the related Central  Trust Circles CTCs.  In 2020, ENISA will fully support the platform from an  operational perspective. In particular, ENISA will run  a dedicated project for tools integration that would  benefit CSIRTs using MeliCERTes. In close cooperation  with the CSIRTs Network, ENISA will synchronize  its efforts with the contractor of MeliCERTes II.  Introducing changes to operational tools during  crisis  or large scale incidents is not possible, because it can  disrupt business continuity of CSIRTs Network SOPs.  Therefore changes to tools can be done only during  the default operation mode of the CNW.  The Agency  will continue  collaborating with  other operational  EU bodies to ensure  a structured  cooperation in line  with the provisions of  the Cybersecurity Act.  52  Summary of the outputs and performance indicators in Activity 4 – Community  Outputs Type of output (P=publication, E=Event,  S=Support)  Performance indicator  Objective 4.1.

Summary of outputs and performance indicators in Activity 4 Community  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 53  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  ACTIVITY 5 – CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION. DEVELOPING SECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES FOR DIGITAL  PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND PROCESSES  Objective 5.1. Support activities related  to cybersecurity certification  Taking into account the legislative and policy  developments in the area of EU Cybersecurity  Certification and acting within the boundaries of its  competence, ENISA will continue working to meet  the requirements for the certification framework for  ICT security products and services by for instance  promoting mutual recognition or harmonisation of  certification practices up to a certain level, in line with  the Cybersecurity Act. Any planned activity in the  area of cybersecurity certification will respect existing  national efforts and interests as well as subsidiarity as  it applies in the area of certification.  Building on the work in 2019, ENISA will provide  support to the European Commission and the  Member States in the policy area of EU cybersecurity  certification framework within the scope of the  Cybersecurity Act. ENISA will stimulate the interaction  and involvement of stakeholders of the Member  States, public policy and the industry in the emerging  EU certification framework.  According to its new role defined by the Cybersecurity  Act, ENISA will support the European Commission by  joining the process of drafting a work programme  for certification. By interacting with the European  Commission, ENISA could assist in gathering  requirements from the private sector and institutional  stakeholders to facilitate the Eorupean Commission  efforts based on an annual plan.  ENISA will provide support for the organisation  of the EU cybersecurity certification framework  (organisational and IT systems and support) and  analysis of functional equivalence of existing  certification schemes across the EU (at the MS as well  as the EU level) with the emerging EU certification  framework to facilitate the transition to the new EU  framework. ENISA will continue to interact with key  stakeholders associated with the EU cybersecurity  certification framework.  Output 5.1.1 – Support the European  Cybersecurity Certification Group, potential  subgroups thereof and the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group  Supporting the European Commission in its role as  chair of the European Cybersecurity Certification  Group, ENISA also helps with the organisation of  the European Cybersecurity Certification Group  and potential subgroups by providing services (to  be determined with the European Commission) like  support for the secretariat, organisational aspects  etc. ENISA will also carry out its tasks as co-chair with  the Commission of the Stakeholder Cybersecurity  Certification Group, and provide secretariat services.  Output 5.1.2 – Research and analysis of the  market as an enabler for certification  By means of analysis and drafting reports, ENISA  will seek to maintain a high level of understanding  of the main drivers for cybersecurity certification in  the EU. The implementation of SOG-IS as a scheme  into the EU cybersecurity certification framework is  a priority task for ENISA. Other areas of interest will  gradually follow when developing the Union Rolling  Work Programme and via requests addressed to the  Agency. The aim of ENISA is to support public policy in  EU cybersecurity certification to protect citizen rights  (e.g. consumer rights, personal data, privacy etc.)  and public interests (e.g. public purchasing in the MS  by means of public procurement). Additionally, 5G  will require particular attention to achieve the policy  objectives. Provided there is a suitable prioritisation  on the Union Rolling Work Programme for  cybersecurity certification, ENISA will shift requests  and Union Rolling Work Programme priorities to  the scheme promulgation process. Additionally, a  market analysis on the EU cybersecurity certification  framework’s impact on manufacturers and service  providers is another area of interest .  Output 5.1.3 – Set-up and maintenance of a  certification portal and associated services  There are technical and organisational tasks  associated with setting up and maintaining a portal.  An IT platform in support of the EU cybersecurity  certification framework goes beyond the scope of  a portal as it must accommodate the needs of all  stakeholders involved (document management,  user management, consultations) and enable  the presentation of dependable information on  certification schemes as required by the regulation.  54  Objective 5.2. Developing candidate  cybersecurity certification schemes  Output 5.2.1 – Hands on tasks in the area of  cybersecurity certification of products, services  and processes  Based on the PDCA (plan-do check-act, and  repeat) approach, ENISA will strive to provide a  comprehensive set of services that include planning,  data collection, consultations, drafting and reviewing.  ENISA will have developed a general methodology  to prepare candidate cybersecurity certification  schemes. ENISA will support by planning and  prioritising and it will provide lists of stakeholders to  give input and offer consultations. ENISA will develop  a feedback mechanism for affected stakeholders e.g.  standardisation organisations. ENISA will continue  to hold its EU Cybersecurity Certification Conference  once or twice a year.  Output 5.2.2 – Tasks related to specific candidate  schemes and ad hoc working groups  In accordance with the Rolling Work Programme  or on request in accordance with the Cybersecurity  Act, ENISA will develop candidate cybersecurity  certification schemes based on the work from 2019  and its own knowledge as well as the input received  from stakeholders. ENISA will support the lifecycle  of the dedicated ad hoc working groups. ENISA  will also follow up with its candidate schemes until  they have been submitted to and accepted by the  European Commission for formal consideration and  eventual approval.

Work programme for the year 2020  ACTIVITY 6 – ENABLING. REINFORCE  ENISA’S IMPACT  Objective 6.1. Management and  compliance  Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall  management of the Agency.  In 2020, the Management Board (MB) Secretariat  will continue to support the Management Board and  the Executive Board in their functions by providing  secretariat assistance. It includes, but is not limited  to the support for meetings and correspondence  that takes place between meetings, the management  of annual declarations of interest and of the  commitment and other requirements.  In relation to the MB, two ordinary meetings will be  organised in 2020 and informal meetings will be held  when necessary. The MB Portal will be supported for  the MB. Regarding the Executive Board, one formal  meeting will be organised per quarter and informal  meetings will be held when necessary.  The Resources Department (RD) oversees a variety  of programs, projects and services related to the  overall management of the Agency, supporting  the Executive Director decisions in areas such  as personnel, finance, procurement, purchasing,  technology, facility management, health, safety,  security, protocol, liaison with local authorities,  MeliCERTes infrastructure, etc.  The aim of the RD is to support the Agency with the  best possible level of efficiency and the best use of  the resources made available to the Agency. This also  includes coordination with the European Commission  Internal Audit Service, European Court of Auditors,  European Ombudsman, European Commission,  European Anti-Fraud Office, EU DG HR, EU DG  BUDG, DG CNECT, etc. All internal policies related to  transparency, anti-fraud policy, protection of whistle- blowers, declarations of interests, prevention of  harassment, etc. are addressed within this activity.  RD strives to maintain and enhance the Agency’s  efficiency and effectiveness of the  and to  continuously contribute to ENISA’s strategy both  internally and externally by seeking optimal solutions  for fulfilling ENISA’s mandate and providing the  necessary assurance of compliance.  The aim is to enable the Agency to minimize  the resources needed with adequate and  modern procedures and tools to maximise the  intended outcome of the work programme and  statutory commitments.  The Core Operations Department (COD)  coordinates the delivery of the Agency’s core  activities. As such, the main role of the COD is to take  on activities A1-A5 of this work programme. The COD  also includes the Policy Unit and the Public Affairs  Team. COD also supports the Advisory group.  Policy Unit  The Policy Unit reports into the Head of Core  Operations. Through the Policy unit, the Agency  initiates and develops strategic cooperations with  active relevant stakeholders from the cybersecurity  community. For instance, the Agency engages  in policy and strategy discussions with political  decision makers (by participating or organizing e.g.  EU MEP activities).  Furthermore, the Agency engages and develops  strategic relationships with e.g. specific industry  sectors at decision making level, and identifies the  strategic issues regarding cybersecurity. The Policy  Unit will also be able to support different institutions  and bodies with regard to policy initiatives related to  cybersecurity. Some of the results of these activities  of the Policy Unit have been published as opinion  papers on ENISA webpage.  Planning the Agency’s activities, including the  Single Programming Document preparation and  coordination of the Work Programme are part of the  Policy Unit’s tasks.  The Policy Unit also includes the Public Affairs Team.  The Public Affairs Team (PAT) reports into the Head  of the Policy Unit and is responsible for coordinating  all communication activities, including media and  press activities such as press releases, news items  and interviews to enhance the reputation, visibility  and the public image of the Agency. It supports the  entire Agency with regard to publications, social  media promotion, website management, public  affairs activities and awareness campaigns. PAT is  also responsible for establishing ENISA's corporate  visual identity.  PAT also plays a major role in supporting events  attended by the Agency, ensuring that ENISA is well  represented from a public affairs perspective.  56  Quality management is part of the Policy Unit. The  Agency implements a Quality Management System  (QMS) to support its regulatory and strategic goals  by means of a quality management approach. The  methodology is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act  (PDCA) cycle, documented in a dedicated SOPs,  and is being applied accordingly. Besides these  activities, more details of the activities delivered by  the Policy Unit and Public Affairs team are listed in  Objective 6.2 – Engagement with stakeholders and  international activities.  Internal control  ENISA aims at implementing the new COSO  framework as well as its new requirements to be  aligned with the European Commission.  The exercise will include the adoption of this framework  by the Management Board as well as the assessment of  the compliance of these Internal Controls.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk  management, governance and internal control  processes of the Agency to provide independent  and objective assurance to the Senior Management,  Executive Director and the Management Board.  IT activities  During 2020 it is expected that the Agency has a  new fully operating datacentre and, in partnership  with other EU Agencies, a Disaster Recovery site at  its disposal,which will enhance the availability of IT  services. It will also help the Agency to be prepared  for any challenges that may arise.  Following up the assessment of information security  risks and IT operational procedures, ENISA will put  in place and update all policies and procedures to  mitigate any identified risks.  For 2020 and following up on the actions of 2019, the  Agency will be heavily investing in strengthening its  capabilities in the areas of information security and  cybersecurity to continue its policy of having the best  security posture possible.  IT supports all internal electronic infrastructures  of the Agency, including, but not limited to core  applications for business use and operation systems.  MeliCERTes. In 2020, ENISA will be running the  central component of MeliCERTes. MeliCERTes will  be the primary collaboration platform for CSIRTs  of participating Member States as well as a means  to improve EU MS preparedness, cooperation and  coordinationto improve cyber threat and cross-border  incident response. The MeliCERTes project will be run  in close cooperation with the EC and MS. The EC will  get a new contract for several areas of the project  for the near future. The long term sustainability  and development of this project will be analysed in  collaboration with all stakeholders involved.  Finance and Procurement  The Agency plans to upgrade its internally developed  electronic tools used for Procurement to simplify  and further automate its tasks related to tendering  and contracting. This is deemed necessary due to the  expected increase of the volume of the work based  on a significantly increased operational budget. It is  anticipated that the further development of the in- house systems should be outsourced.

Internal policies  are in constant evolution to ensure compliance with  the Financial Regulation and Procurement rules. In  line with the internal efficiency increase, the Agency  upskills the internal guidelines and trainings to  guarantee a clear guidance for internal use and to  optimise the available resources.  Budget management identified the need to upgrade  the supporting IT system (ENISA will look for best  practices at other EU agencies).  Human Resources  The ultimate goal of HR is to attract, select, develop  and retain highly qualified staff, to optimise  organisational structures, to promote a safe  working environment (which includes prevention of  harassment), to create a culture that reflects ENISA’s  vision and values in which staff can reach their full  potential and help achieving the organisation’s  objectives.

This includes:  –  developing KPIs  Monitoring and reporting the following to the IT  Advisory Committee:  –  KPI results  –  Incidents identified and managed  –  Non-compliances with policy identified and  addressed  Improving the security posture of ENISA by  planning penetration tests and vulnerability  assessments  Advising on security policies and updating existing  ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks  Improving the internal IT security training for  ENISA’s staff  Implementing new systems and tools that support  improvements regarding information security.  Objective 6.2. Engagement with  stakeholders and international activities  Stakeholder communication and dissemination  activities  In 2020, ENISA will continue to focus on key activities  and engage the increasing number of stakeholders.  This includes the different groups of stakeholders  such as  institutions, academia, industry, citizens, etc.  In its engagement with the stakeholders, the Agency  is guided by certain principles such as objectiveness,  openness, transparency and inclusiveness.  Dissemination and outreach  The Agency will continue developing different tools  and channels including the website and with a  strong emphases on social media. Dissemination  activities are the responsibility of the Stakeholders  Communication Team that will define the appropriate  level of outreach activities to make ENISA´s work  available for all interested entities and to provide  added value for Europe.  ENISA´s reputation forquality and trust is of  paramount importance to all stakeholders. It is higly  important that all European citizens  have trust in  ENISA and its work. The cybersecurity challenges  are increasing all over the globe and Europe is no  exception. With this objective ENISA´s reputation  needs to be reinforced continuously. The outreach  tpo promote the Agency’s work is essential to create a  NIS culture across the several actors in Europe. ENISA  is aware of that and will work with eyeryone who  is interested to reach the citizens that want to get  information about the Agency’s work.  Numerous activities that will increase the  cybersecurity awareness across Europe are planned  with different Member Statesto fulfill ENISA´s  mandate, mission and strategy until the end of 2020.

A  strong corporate culture improves staff engagement  and ultimately supports the implementation of the  work programme. It is envisaged to do an annual  review of this strategy to ensure that it is kept up to  date and appropriate for the Agency.  ENISA Advisory Group  In 2020, ENISA will continue to support the ENISA  Advisory Group and the group’s contribution to the  ENISA Work Programme.  The Advisory Group is composed of recognised experts  representing the relevant stakeholders such as the  ICT industry, providers of publicly available electronic  communications networks or services, SMEs, essential  service operators , consumer groups, academic experts  in the field of cybersecurity, and representatives of  competent authorities in accordance with Directive  (EU) 2018/1972 of European standardisation  organisations, as well as of law enforcement and data  protection supervisory authorities.  The Advisory Group is a statutory body of ENISA  pursuant to Article 21 of the Cybersecurity Act  (Regulation (EU) No 2019/881). The Management Board,  acting on a proposal by the Executive Director, sets up  the ENISA Advisory Group for a tenure of 2.5 years.  The role of the Advisory Group is to advise ENISA  regarding ENISA’s performance, excluding Title  III of the Cybersecurity Act which concerns the  Cybersecurity Certification Framework. It shall advise  the Executive Director on the creation of a proposal  for ENISA’s annual work programme and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders on all  related issues. During Q2 2020 a new Advisory Group  will take office.  National Liaison Officer Network  In 2017, ENISA has kicked off various activities  aiming at strengthening the cooperation with its  National Liaison Officers’ (NLO) Network. These  activities were continued and expanded in 2018  and 2019. Based on the Cybersecurity Act, the NLOs  are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and they  warrant the interaction with select public sector  entities in the MS while providing assurance in  terms of outreach, effective liaison with the MS and  dissemination of ENISA’s deliverables.  A strong corporate  culture improves  staff engagement and  ultimately supports  the implementation of  the work programme  ENISA PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT 2020–2022 61  PART III. Work programme for the year 2020  ENISA will build on these activities with the NLO  Network as an additional first point of contact for  ENISA in the MS beyond the Management Board,  with emphasis on:  NLO meetings to discuss possible improvements  in the collaboration with ENISA and input on  selected ENISA projects. Improvements aim at  leveraging the NLO network for the dissemination  of ENISA’s work to the EU Member States and  EFTA countries.  The members of the NLO network will continue  to receive information on ENISA’s deliverables,  upcoming ENISA project related tenders,  news, working groups entailing requests for  identification of experts in the MS, vacancy  notices, and events organised or supported (for  example as co-organiser, etc.) by ENISA  as well as  time-sensitive information.  The Agency will maintain and share information  on all relevant ENISA projects and activities  (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant  tender results, etc.) with the NLO network while  maintaining and expanding available online  resources when appropriate.  Additionally, guidelines provided by the Management  Board on missions, objectives and functioning of  the NLO network will guide the development of this  important tool for ENISA for community building.  International relations  Under the executive director’s guidance and  initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level in line with the relevant provisions  of the new Cybersecurity Act.  62  List of outputs in the Work Programme 2020  Activity 1 – Expertise.

Overview of the past and current  situation  The WP 2020 is following the COM guidelines  and MB’s decisions. It is structured following the  objectives and the priorities of the Agency, using  a structure build on the previous years, where a  new activity was added to address the work to be  continued in the area of cybersecurity certification.  ENISA’s budget comparing the years 2018 and 2019 is  increasing due to the new mandate of the Agency and  the scope of its new tasks.  As already presented, for the preparation of Work  Programme 2020, ENISA is using the resources  proposed in the Annexes of the European  Commission’s proposal for ENISA’s new mandate  COM(2017) 477 final. The past and current human  and financial resources are presented in the Annexes  of this document.  Resource programming for the years  2020–2022  The distribution of budget and resources for 2020 for  the activities A1 to A6 is presented in the chart.  ANNEX 1 RESOURCE ALLOCATION  PER ACTIVITY 2020–2022  65  Enabling 21.8 %  Certification 14.4 %  Cooperation 15.3 %  Capacity 16.9 %  Policy 13.1 %  Expertise 18.5 %  Enabling 33.9 %  Certification 13.0 %  Cooperation 13.0 %  Capacity 11.5 %  Policy 15.6 %  Expertise 13.0 %  WP Budget and posts distribution (ABB)  100  90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  10  0 Budget (%) Posts (%)  66  The Agency applies a strict policy on ratio between  “administrative support and coordination” staff and  “operational” staff following the methodology set  by the European Commission on the benchmarking  exercise. The European Commission levels up the  overhead (administration support and coordination)  up to 25%. The table below reflects the situation  at ENISA:  Type 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020  Total Administrative Support and Coordination 19.04% 19.27% 22.89% 18.37% 17.54%  Administrative Support 15.47% 15.66% 19.28% 15.30% 14.91%  Coordination 3.57% 3.61% 3.61% 3.07% 2.63%  Total Operational 66.66% 66.27% 62.65% 69.39% 69.30%  Top Operational Coordination 7.14% 7.23% 7.23% 5.10% 4.39%  General Operational 59.52% 59.04% 55.42% 64.29% 64.91%  Total Neutral 14.29% 14.46% 14.46% 12.24% 13.16%  Finance and Control 14.29% 14.46% 14.46% 12.24% 13.16%  Following the publication of the NIS Directive (NISD),  the Agency is re-allocating budget and resources to  the new tasks/activities provisioned for the Agency in  the Directive. Another area which will probably require  more budget/resources is the Cybersecurity Public  Private Partnership (cPPP). Furthermore, a significant  part of the new resources and budget are foreseen,  according to the draft Cybersecurity Act, to be allocated  to the new Activity 5 on cybersecurity certification.  For the interval of 2020-2022 an increase of budget  and resources allocated to the new activity on  cybersecurity certification and to operational activities  described in the draft Cybersecurity Act is foreseen.  The budget and resources allocations for 2020-2022  within the summary tables and Annexes are in line  with the European Commission’s proposal for ENISA’s  new mandate COM(2017) 477 final.  Overview of activities budget and  resources  The budget and posts  distribution is based on the  Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) methodology of  the Agency, which is in line with the Activity Based  Management (ABM) principle. ABB focuses on  integrated budgeting and financial management  based on activities linked to the Agency’s priorities  and objectives.  To improve estimation of necessary resources for  each ENISA activity, the Agency needs to split the  budget forecast into direct and indirect budget.  The following assumptions are used based on the  simplified ABB methodology:  Direct budget is the cost estimate of each  Operational activity (listed in Activities A1 to A6)  in terms of goods and services procured.  Indirect budget is the cost estimate of salaries,  mission costs and overhead costs, attributable to  each Operational or Compliance activity. The  indirect budget is re-distributed against direct  budget in all activities.  Compliance posts  from Activity A6 (Enabling) are  re-distributed to core activities – A1 to A5, and  operational posts  of the Activity A6.  Total ABB posts  (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts  from all activities (A1 to A6) after the re-distribution.  The table in the next page presents the allocation  of financial and human resources to activities of the  Agency based on the above ABB methodology.

CALCULATION  OF BUDGET OUTTURN IN EURO  Cancellation of appropriations  Cancellation of Commitment Appropriations  In 2018, Commitment Appropriations were  cancelled for an amount of EUR 1,751.66  representing 0.02 % of the total budget. ENISA  demonstrates a commitment rate of 99.98 %  of C1 appropriations of the year at the end  of the year (31/12). The consumption of the  2018 budget at the end of the year shows  the capacity of the Agency to fully implement  its annual appropriations. The same level  commitment rate is maintained for nine years  in a row. The payment rate reached 88.56 %  and the amount carried forward to 2019 is EUR  1,232,263.40 representing 11.42 % of the total C1  appropriations 2018.  Cancellation of Payment Appropriations  No payment appropriations were cancelled.  Cancellation of Payment Appropriations  Carried over (Fund source “C8” – appropriations  carried over automatically from 2017 to 2018.)  The appropriations of 2017 carried over to 2018  were utilised at a rate of 92.33 % (automatic carry- overs) which indicates a satisfactory capability  of estimation of needs. From the amount of  EUR 1,411,440.51 carried over, the amount of EUR  108,302.57 was cancelled, due to the fact that the  estimated expenditure deviated from the amount  actually paid. This cancellation represents 1 % of  the total budget.  72  Staff  population  A ut  ho ri  se d  un de  r  EU  bu  dg et  2 01  7  A ct  ua lly  fi lle  d  as  of  3 1.  1 2.  2 01  7  A ut  ho ri  se d  un de  r  EU  b ud  ge t  fo r  ye ar  2 01  8  A ct  ua lly  fi lle  d  as  of  3 1.  1 2.  2 01  8  In  b  ud ge  t  fo  r  ye ar  2 01  9  En vi  sa ge  d  in  20  20  En vi  sa ge  d  in  20  21  En vi  sa ge  d  in  20  22  Offi- cials  AD  AST  AST/SC  TA  AD 34 29 34 32 43 51 57 60  AST 14 13 13 12 16 18 19 19  AST/SC  Total 48 42 47 43 59 69 76 79  CA GFIV 28 17 28 16 28 28 28 28  CA GF III 2 11 5 10 2 2 2 2  CA GF II 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  CA GFI 1 0 1 0 0 0 0  Total CA 30 29 33 27 30 30 30* 30  SNE 6 3 3 3 9 12 12 12  Structural ser- vice providers  TOTAL 84 74 83 73 98 111 118 121  External staff  for occasional  replacement  5 5 5 5  Table 1. Staff population and its evolution; overview of all categories of staff  ANNEX 3 HUMAN RESOURCES —  QUANTITATIVE  * While the Agency acknowledges the decrease of CAs (minus 3) and increase of SNEs for 2020-2022, ENISA promotes a more flexible  approach in the use of CAs as agreed by the EU Agencies Network, notably because the use of CAs shall be used as FTE and not  headcounts in accordance with the wording of Article 33(2) of the Financial Regulations referring to estimate of number of contract staff  expressed in full-time equivalent. The management of CAs is by nature a budget related notion being key for the Agency as a flexible  resource allowing the adaptation to business needs focusing on results to achieve and Work programme.  73  Catego- ry and  grade  Estab- lishment  plan  in EU  Budget  2018  Filled as  of 31. 12.  2018  Modifica- tions in  year 2018  in appli- cation of  flexibility  rule  Estab- lishment  plan in  voted EU  Budget  2019  Modifi- cations  in year  2019 in  applica- tion of  flexibility  rule  Estab- lishment  plan 2020  Estab- lishment  plan 2021  Estab- lishment  plan 2022  OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA OF TA  AD 16  AD 15  1  1  1  1  1  AD 14  1  AD 13  1 2  AD 12  3  3  6  6  5 4  AD 11  2  2  AD 10  5  3  5  5  3 4  AD 9 10  4  12  12  12 11  AD 8 15  8  19  21 22 22  AD 7  3  3 8 8  AD 6  8  3  3 6  AD 5  1  Total AD 34 31 43 51 57 60  AST 11  AST 10  AST 9  AST 8  1 2  AST 7 2  1  3  4  4 3  AST 6  5  2  7  8  8 8  AST 5  5  2  5  5  5 5  AST 4  1  4  1  1 1 1  AST 3  3  AST 2  AST 1  Total AST 13 12 16 18 19 19  AST/SC1  AST/SC2  AST/SC3  AST/SC4  AST/SC5  AST/SC6  Total  AST/SC  TOTAL 47 43 59 69 76 79  Table 2. Multi-annual staff policy plan year 2020 – 2022 (including staffing evolution  proposal to offer career path possibilities to staff)  74  A. RECRUITMENT POLICY  Statutory Staff  The Agency continues to enhance the management of  the selection procedures focusing on improving time  to hire, developing best practices in recruitment and  streamlining processes. The acquisition of a modern  e-recruitment tool from another EU Agency would  definitively help.  The Agency is also investing in the development of an  strategic approach for HR focusing on competency- based interview’s questions, tailor-made trainings for  Board Member selection, alignment of competencies  across the organisation per job profile, targeted  recruitment procedures for specialised profiles,  transversal recruitment procedures where reserve  lists could be used to fill vacant positions across all  departments/units, specific dissemination of job  vacancies at ENISA, etc.  The job family and job category framework is being  consolidated in line with the Annex I of the SR:  Assistant job family:  Assistant job category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities such as  assistance and/or secretariat requiring a certain  degree of autonomy): typically, these posts are  filled by grades SC1-SC2, AST1-AST3, FGI, FGII  Technical Assistant job category (staff providing  support with a medium degree of autonomy in  the drafting of documents and assistance in the  implementation of policies/projects/procedures/ processes): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AST4-AST7, FG III  Senior Assistant job category (staff carrying out  administrative, technical activities requiring high  degree of autonomy and carrying out significant  responsibilities in terms of staff management,  budget implementation or coordination):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AST7- AST11 and only for the two Assistants to Head of  Departments by FG IV  Operational job family:  Junior Officer/Administrator job category (staff  providing junior expertise in a specific field of  knowledge): typically, these posts are filled by  grades AD5, FG IV 13  Officer/Administrator job category (staff providing  officer expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD6-AD7,  FG IV 14-18  Lead Officer/Administrator (staff providing top  level expertise in a specific field of knowledge):  typically, these posts are filled by grades AD8-AD9  Team Leader job category (staff providing  operational excellence with some managerial  responsibilities): typically, these posts are filed by  grades AD7-AD10, FG IV 14-18  Special Advisor job category (staff providing direct  assistance in a specific field of knowledge): typically,  these posts are filled by grades AD9-AD12.  Managerial job family:  Middle Manager job category (staff providing  operational vision and managerial expertise  including financial management): typically, these  posts are Head of Unit positions filled by grades  AD9-AD12  Senior Manager job category (staff providing  strategical vision and managerial expertise  including financial expertise): typically, these posts  are Head of Department positions filled by grades  AD11-AD13  Executive Director (filled by grades AD14-15).  Following the 2014 SR reform, ENISA adopted and  is applying the new implementing rules on the  engagement and use of Temporary Staff for Agencies  (TA 2f), thus ensuring a more consistent staff policy  and allowing inter-mobility between EU agencies.  The established type of posts are in line with Annex I  and Article 80 of the Staff Regulations of Officials and  the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of  the European Union, while the recruitment grades  are in line with Article 3 of the MB Decision/12 of the  ENISA on the general implementation provisions on  ANNEX 4 HUMAN RESOURCES –  QUALITATIVE  75  the procedure governing the engagement and use of  temporary staff under Article 2(f) of the CEOS and EC  Decision C(2011) 1264.  ENISA evaluates the available options with all due  care to not recruit at excessive grade levels and in  line with the Establishment Plan. Nevertheless, in  some cases, the recruitment of experts set above  the entry grade was used as the only solution to  attract the right profile(s) and to ensure nationality  balance (e.g.: TA/AD12 Lead expert for certification).  In the same logic, the use of the AST/SC grade for  secretarial positions, while being in place since the  2014 Staff Regulations Reform, would negatively  impact the attraction and retention of qualified and  geographically diverse staff.  Concerning the duration of employment, the  typical duration was a long-term contract of three  years, renewable for another limited period of  five years with a second renewal for an indefinite  period. While it remains the case for Contract  Agents (3+5+indefinite), the duration for contracts  of Temporary Agents was amended30 to improve  the attractiveness and retention. Hence, the typical  duration for newly recruited Temporary Agents  is an initial 5-year contract with the possibility to  be renewed for an indefinite period. However, all  contract renewals are subject to an assessment of  the performance of the staff member, the budget  availability and the business needs for the function  occupied as stipulated in the ED Decision 38/2017 of 6  June 2017 concerning employment contract renewal.  In the past, ENISA used short-term contract agents  (two years, renewable once for a maximum one year)  but came to the conclusion that this type of contract  does not meet the long-term needs of the Agency  in delivering the objectives. It does not mean that  depending on the business needs and the volatility of  the workforce market, the Agency won’t make use of  this possibility again.  Non-Statutory Staff  ENISA welcomes Seconded National Experts (SNEs) as  an opportunity to foster the exchange of experiences  and knowledge of the Agency’s working methods  and to widen the expert network. Experts can be  seconded to ENISA for the duration of a minimum  six months to a maximum of four years. ENISA offers  paid traineeship opportunities to talented, highly  qualified young professionals at the start of their  careers in a field of their choice. Trainees have the  opportunity to immerse themselves in the Agency's  work and in the European system in general. The  30 ED Decision 16/2019 of 20 February 2019  traineeship may last from a minimum of six months  to a maximum of twelve months.  Finally, in compliance with both the EU legal  framework and the Greek labour legislation, ENISA’s  policy is intended to rely on interim services under  specific circumstances and for limited period of time.  The Agency holds a framework contract that has been  awarded to a temping Agency.  B. APPRAISAL OF PERFORMANCE AND  RECLASSIFICATION/PROMOTIONS  ENISA has adopted the implementing rules MB  2016/10 on Reclassification of CA’s, MB 2016/11 on  Reclassification of TA’s. ENISA is applying a qualitative  performance management based on the European  Commission Model.  For the forthcoming years, the organisation will strive  to see performance management as a business  process that improves employee engagement and  drive business results. It enables staff to focus on  having a constructive dialogue with the manager and  to consider the exercise as a valuable developmental  tool, while clarifying that the appraisal and the  reclassification are two different exercises.  76  Category  and grade  Staff in activity at 01.01.2018 How many staff members  were reclassified in 2019  Average number of years  in grade of reclassified/  promoted staff members officials TA officials TA  AD 16  AD 15 1  AD 14  AD 13  AD 12 3  AD 11  AD 10 3  AD 9 2  AD 8 10 2 2.5  AD 7 3  AD 6 7 2 4.25  AD 5 1  Total AD 30  AST 11  AST 10  AST 9  AST 8  AST 7 1  AST 6 2  AST 5 2  AST 4 6 1 2  AST 3 2 1 5  AST 2  AST 1  Total AST 13  AST/SC1  AST/SC2  AST/SC3  AST/SC4  AST/SC5  AST/SC6  Total AST/SC  Total 43 6  Table 1. Reclassification of temporary staff/promotion of officials  77  ANNEX Human resources — qualitative  Function  group  Grade Staff in activity at  01.01.2018  How many staff members  were reclassified in 2019  Average number of years in grade  of reclassified staff members  CA IV 17  16 1  15 1  14 11  13 3  CA III 11 1  10 2 3 6  9 7 1 5  8 2  CA II  CA I 3 1  Total 29 4  Table 2. Reclassification of contract staff  C. MOBILITY POLICY  All internal moves are processed via Article 7 of the  Staff Regulations and for transparency purposes  are published internally on INTRAENISA. In order to  create a motivated and versatile workforce, ENISA  has adopted an ED Policy 01/2017 of 22 February  2017 on Internal Mobility Policy. ENISA also joined the  inter-agency job market (IAJM), like all other Agencies,  to offer mobility possibilities to the Agency employees  by assuring a continuation of careers and grades.  Additionally, ENISA is also open to mobility between  the agencies and the EU Institutions.  a.  Mobility within agency: since January 2019, 13  staff members where moved under Article 7 of  Staff Regulations.  b.  Mobility among agencies: in 2019, 1 staff member  was recruited under Inter-Agency Mobility Call.  c. Mobility between agency and Institutions: in 2019,  3 former ENISA staff members moved to EU agencies  and 1 former employee moved to an EU Institution.  D. LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT  The Agency is striving for excellence when it comes  to staff development. In order to make the most out  of its internal expertise and to develop mechanisms  to retain staff, the organisation is focusing on  offering a wide range of learning and development  opportunities including mandatory trainings (e.g.  Ethics and Integrity, harassment prevention, etc.),  various workshops and team building events, on-line  courses, access to EU-Learn, etc.  78  Per Gender  Male  52 % Female  48 %  E. GENDER AND GEOGRAPHICAL  BALANCE  The overall gender balance among ENISA staff shows  a slight male prevalence that is understandable given  the scope of the Agency's work. As a measure to  promote equal opportunities, the terms of published  vacancy notices prevent any kind of discrimination  and the Selection Board’s composition is balanced  in terms of gender and nationality as far as possible.  In 2019, the Agency had 2 women HoUs (Head of HR  unit and Head of Finances and Procurement unit) and  6 women coordinating teams.  With regard to the geographical balance, while there  is no quota system in operation, when recruiting,  the Staff Regulations require to strive for a broad  balance among nationalities and to adopt necessary  measures if there is imbalance between nationalities  among staff. ENISA is paying great attention to this  requirement. However, ENISA is facing the same  challenges (as reported by the European Commission  for the European Civil Service and as with some  other EU Agencies with low coefficient correcteur) in  attracting and retaining some nationalities. This is  mainly due to the specific labour market where ENISA  operates and high salaries in the private sector which  ENISA is cannot compete with due to low corrector  coefficient. Hence, ENISA is facing challenges in  increasing it visibility on the market as an employer  of choice. Moreover, ENISA is not offering an  accredited European School in Athens and, at the  same time, partners of the staff members lack the  possibility to find a job, which makes the situation  even more difficult for ENISA to attract staff from  some specific nationalities. ENISA is committed to  ensure a diverse workforce representation, however  strives to retain staff from some nationailities on the  abovementioned consideration.  The graphics reflect the situation as for 31.12.2018.

A new seat agreement between ENISA and the  Hellenic Authorities entered into force on the  04/10/2019. As per the new seat agreement signed  by ENISA and the Hellenic Authorities, the Agency will  continue having premises in Athens and Heraklion  as it had under the previous agreement. However,  the permanent seat of the Agency is now in Athens  having the majority of its staff there. The premises  of ENISA in Athens are privately owned and rented  by the Agency, while the premises in Heraklion are  located in a public building made available by the  Hellenic Authorities. The payment of rents for the  premises in Athens and Heraklion are covered by the  Hellenic Authorities who provide up to 640 000 euro  per year.  The current building in Athens will not suffice to  accommodate all the new staff that will be joining  the Agency in virtue of the new Mandate with  the additional challenge that the current renting  contract expires on 31/12/2021 with no possibility  for extension. ENISA is in constant contact with the  Hellenic Authorities to find suitable premises to  accommodate all staff in the near future.  ANNEX 5 BUILDINGS  ANNEX 6 PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES  Agency privileges Privileges granted to staff  Protocol of privileges and immunities /  diplomatic status  Education / day care  In accordance with Art. 23 of  Regulation (EU) No 2019/881  of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 17 April  2019, the protocol No 7 on  the privileges and immunities  of the European Union  annexed to the TEU and the  TFEU applies to the Agency  and its staff.  In accordance with Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No  2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the  Council of 17 April 2019, the protocol No 7 on the  privileges and immunities of the European Union  annexed to the TEU and the TFEU applies to the  Agency and its staff.  The Greek Government and ENISA signed a seat  agreement on 13 November 2018, which was ratified  by Greek Law 4627/2019 on 25 September 2019 and is  applicable to ENISA and its staff.  A public School of  European Education, Type  2, was founded in 2005 by  the Greek government in  Heraklion, Crete, for the  children of ENISA’s staff. There is no European  School operating in Athens.  81  ENISA uses an internal monitoring system (MATRIX)  that is also used for project management. ENISA’s  management team regularly uses this information,  which is also used for monthly reporting. Moreover,  ENISA has implemented a mid-term review procedure  and monthly management team meetings.  External consultants are contracted to carry annual  ex-post evaluation of operational activities. The scope  of the evaluation focusses on ENISA’s operational  activities. The overall aim of the annual evaluations is  to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, added value,  utility, coordination and coherence.  ANNEX 7 EVALUATIONS  The Self Risk Assessment was performed by the  Internal Audit Service in 2016. Three areas were  proposed for the three next years: Stakeholder  involvement in the production of ENISA’s deliverables  (done in 2017), Human Resources (2018), Information  and Communication Technology (2019).

The ENISA organisation valid as of 01.11.2019 with  active staff is as follows:  Management  Board  Executive  Board  RD  Resource  Department  Advisory  Group  COD  Core Operations  Department  CS  Corporate  Services  FAP  Finance and  Procurement  HSA  Horizontal  Support and  Analysis Team  COD 1 Secure  Infrastructure  and Services  COD 2  Data Security &  Standardisation  COD 3  Operational  Security  PO  Policy Unit  HR  Human  Resources  CR  CSIRT  Relations  Team  Executive  Director  AD 3 AST 0 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 1 AST 1 CA 0  SNE 0  AD 2 AST 0 CA 1  SNE 0  AD 2 AST 2 CA 5  SNE 0  AD 6 AST 1 CA 5  SNE 1 AD 1 AST 3 CA 1  SNE 0  AD 2 AST 0 CA 0  SNE 0 AD 6 AST 1 CA 2  SNE 0 AD 1 AST 0 CA 4  SNE 0  AD 4 AST 0 CA 1  SNE 0 AD 3 AST 1 CA 3  SNE 1  AD 1 AST 4 CA 4  SNE 0  84  ANNEX 11 SUMMARISING THE KEY  INDICATORS FOR THE  MULTIANNUAL ACTIVITIES  In line with the prescribed European Commission  approach, the Agency is in an ongoing process to  improve the standing of its key indicators for the  purpose of improving measuring and reporting  better matching the deliverables of its annual  work programme.  The purpose of the key indicators for ENISA is to  provide the metrics to measure the performance,  results and impact of the Agency’s outcome, output  and impact. Key indicators seek to better depict policy  dynamics on network and information security, an  area of policy that still is under development at EU  level as technology and business models evolve.  The chosen approach initially sets the designated  levels of key indicators; each type of indicator  is grouped alongside other similar ones at the  appropriate level. This approach has been developed  by taking the capability of the Agency to report into  account as well as the need to avoid any unnecessary  burden on the Agency. The Agency’s capability to  report reflects effort, organisational measures and  tools available (or that can be obtained relatively  easily). Measuring operational performance that  concerns the policy raison d'être of the Agency  remains the focal point for the key indicators  introduced. The key notions and main vectors  of annual and multi-annual measurements are  presented hereunder.  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:  Performance that is a concern at the output level  when deliverables are produced. Metrics used are  project management-based and they include:  a.  Adherence to the scope of the deliverable  or project;  Output measured KPIs  for each deliverable  Outcome measured  KRI (Key Results  Indicators) per  Activity  Fitness-for-purpose at  the Agency level: •  E: evaluation report  according to mandate  every 2 years –  external evaluation  (COM, etc.)  Performance  OUTPUT LEVEL  (ex-Deliverables)  Proposed indicators: •  S: scope •  B: budget (*) •  P: people (*) •  T: time (*) •  Q: quality of  performance  (depending on the  output: Publication,  Events, Support)  (*) Up to the designated levels  Results  ANNUAL  ACTIVITIES´ LEVEL (ex-WPK/cluster)  Proposed indicators: •  D: delivery Indicator  (Y/N), i.e. 95% (3  sigma) of projects/  activity delivered in  SBPTQ for year N, with  5% fluctuation margin  •  F: feedback from  stakeholders – Store  and analyse aggregates  in a database  MULTIANNUAL  ACTIVITIES´ LEVEL  Progress of KRI  presented for year N  Proposed indicators: •  95% (3 sigma) of  projects/ activity  delivered in SBPTQ for  year N+1 and N+2, with  5 % fluctuation margin  •  Fa: Feedback  aggregation  Impact  AGENCY LEVEL  Outreach Impact  KII (Key Impact  Indicators)  Multi-annual Annual  85  b.  Budget (or financial resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ±5% margin;  c.  People (or human resources) available to the  output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ±5% margin;  d.  Time available to carry out the output or  project remaining within prescribed levels with  a ±5% margin;  e.  Quality of performance depending on the  type of output, according to the classification  of output in the work programme (being,  publication, event, support).  Results that are a concern at the annual and at  multi-annual activities’ level. The indicators used  are as follows:  a.  Delivery indicator aiming at delivering at least  95% matched with the work programme  planning. This is equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma)  organisation (reaching between 93.3% and  99.3%); clearly the Agency has historically  proven its operational ability to deliver at  a much higher level, meeting 6σ (6 Sigma)  specification requirements (at 99.99%).  However, allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  above-mentioned deviation rate of ±5%.31 The  criteria used, i.e. scope, budget, people, time  and quality, all refer to the proper execution of  the project leading up to the production of the  output. This evaluation is done at the end of  the project within ENISA.  b.  Following the production process that leads  up to an output, feedback from stakeholders is  collected on each output. Results are gathered  on a multi-annual basis by the Agency.  31 In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance  between the mean value and the inflexion point. Shortening this  distance is an indicator of enhanced quality of performance.  While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of  the current version of the QMS of the Agency portions thereof,  are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the  reference Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) hereto is the  SOP PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) that is a simplified version of  the DMAIC (define-measure-analyse-improve-control) approach  typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice for simplicity is  obviously desirable while the implementation of a quality system  is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses on process control for  the purpose of reducing or eliminating waste. Six Sigma utilizes  historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and  improve a company’s operational performance e.g. processes,  practices, and support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of  process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard  deviations from the mean.

All rating indicators follow a variable Traffic Light  Rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows:  Green reflects a 5% deviation, which means that  planning/performance is appropriate and within  prescribed levels.  Yellow reflects a 20% deviation, which means that  planning/performance needs to be revisited.  Red reflects a deviation above 20%, which  means that planning/performance needs  a thorough review.  Feedback is collected by using surveys. It is envisaged  that the website’s deliverables section will be  leveraged to gather targeted feedback against each  deliverable. However, this will only be made available  in 2018 the earliest.  Below you can find an example of output related  indicators to be collected regarding the key types of  Agency output, namely, publication, event, support.  87  ANNEX Summarising the key indicators for the multiannual activities  Aggregated outcome at the annual activity level in years n, n+1 and n+2 Multi-annual level  Annual activity x,y,z in year n  Annual activity x,y,z in year n+1  Annual activity x,y,z in year n+2  Multiannual activity  x,y,z evolution  Delivery  related  e.g. output  instantiations 70% Green 20% Yellow 10% Red  e.g. output  instantiations 80% Green 10% Yellow 10% Red  e.g. output  instantiations 90% Green 10% Yellow 0% Red  In each 3 year period  we gather feedback on  a per activity level:  80% Green 13% Yellow 7% Red  Feedback  (external)  e.g. green feedback  Out of 200 responses  45% positive 45% neutral 10% negative  e.g. green feedback  Out of 200 responses  50% positive 40% neutral 10% negative  e.g. green feedback  Out of 200 responses  55% positive 40% neutral 5% negative  In each 3 year period  we gather feedback on  a per activity level:  50% positive 41% neutral 9% negative  Below you can find an example of outcome related indicators to be collected regarding the key types of Agency  activities at the annual and at the multi-annual level.  88  ANNEX 12 LIST OF ACRONYMS ABB: Activity Based Budgeting APF: Annual Privacy Forum BEREC: Body of European Regulators of Electronic  Communications cPPP: Cyber Security Public-Private Partnership  CE2020: Cyber Europe 2020 CEF: Connecting Europe Facility CEP: Cyber Exercises Platform CERT-EU: Computer Emergency Response Team for the  EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies  CEN: European Committee for Standardization CENELEC: European Committee for  Electrotechnical Standardization CIIP: Critical Information Infrastructure Protection CSCG: ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security  Coordination Group CSIRT: Computer Security Incidents Response Teams CSSU: Corporate Stakeholders and Services Unit COD: Core Operational Department COM: European Commission CSS: Cyber Security Strategy CNW: CSIRTs Network DG: EC Directorate-General DG CONNECT: Directorate General for Communications  Networks, Content and Technology DPA: Data Protection Authorities DPO: Data Protection Officer DSM: Digital Single Market E: Event, type of output i.e. conference, workshop,  and seminar  EB: ENISA Executive Board EC3: European Cybercrime Centre, Europol ECA: European Court of Auditors  ECSM: European Cyber Security Month ECSO: European Cyber Security Organisation ED: Executive Director EDO: Executive Directors Office  EDPS: European Data Protection Supervisor eID: electronic Identity eIDAS: Regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services for electronic transactions in the internal market ETSI: European Telecommunications Standards Institute EU: European Union FAP: Finance, Accounting and Procurement  FIRST: Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams FM: Facilities Management FTE: Full Time Equivalents  H2020: Horizon 2020 HoD: Head of Department HR: Human Resources  IAS: Internal Audit Service  ICC & IAC: Internal Control Coordination and Internal  Audit Capability  ICS/SCADA: Industrial Control Systems/Supervisory  Control and Data Acquisition ICT: Information and Communication Technologies IS: Information Systems ISP: Internet Service Providers IXP: Internet Exchange Point KII: Key Impact Indicator  KPI: Key Performance Indicator  LEA: Law Enforcement Agency MFF: Multi Annual Financial framework M2M: Machine to Machine MB: Management Board MS: Member State(s) NAPAC: National Public Authority  Representatives Committee NCSS: National Cyber Security Strategies NIS: Network and Information Security NISD: NIS Directive NLO: National Liaison Officer NRA: National Regulatory Authority O: Output OES: Operators of Essential Services  P: Publication, type of output covering papers,  reports, studies  PDCA: Plan-Do-Check-Act PETs: Privacy Enhancing Technologies PPP: Public Private Partnership PSG: Permanent Stakeholders Group Q: Quarter QMS: Quality Management System R&D: Research and Development RD: Resources Department  S: Support activity, type of output  SB: Supervisory Body SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SDO: Standard Developing Organization SME: Small and Medium Enterprise SO: Strategic Objectives SOP: Standard Operating Procedure SRAD: Stakeholder Relations and Administration Department  TF-CSIRT: Task Force of Computer Security Incidents  Response Teams TLR: Traffic Light Rating TRANSITS: Computer Security and Incident Response  Team (CSIRT) personnel trainings TSP: Trust Service Provider US: United States of America WP: Work Programme  89  ANNEX 13 LIST OF POLICY REFERENCES  The Agency situates its work in the wider context of a legal and policy environment as  pointed out below.
